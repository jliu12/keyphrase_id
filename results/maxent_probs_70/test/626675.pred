inline target insertion
multiple instruction issue
instruction sequencing efficiency
redirects the instruction
instructions in the
incorrectly predicted branch
target insertion is
branch target buffers
predicted successors of
mcfarling and hennessy
instructions to be
pipelining and multiple
deep pipelining and
number of slots
scratched from the
compiler and pipeline
instruction fetch pipeline
code expansion control
instruction sequencing for
incorrect branch prediction
time branch prediction
branch target buffer
branch prediction accuracy
instructions per cycle
instruction can be
instruction issue and
better performance and
insertion is correct
next sequential instruction
insertion slots are
instruction sequencing mechanism

When you're down and you're out 
And you don't think you have a friend 
When you're lost in the doubt 
And you can't see what's around the bend

Just hold on don't turn around
Keep on walking don't lose heart
Cause I am here I am here 
Where ever you are where ever you are

When the rain is falling 
There's no silver lining 
And you just can't seem to find the light
When you need a reason to help you keep believing

May my love be your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)

Don't you know that I know
Life can be so hard 
It makes you wanna give up
(Wanna give up wanna give up)

But don't you know over the horizon 
The sunny day you're looking for
Is waiting right here in my love

Just hold on don't turn around
Keep on walking don't lose heart
Cause I am here I am here 
Where ever you are where ever you are 

When the rain is falling 
There's no silver lining 
And you just can't seem to find the light
When you need a reason to help you keep believing

May my love be your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love is here to stay

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love is here to stay

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love is here to stay

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love 

When the rain is falling 
There's no silver lining 
And you just cant seem to find the light
When you need a reason to help you keep believing

May my love be your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)
Your sky (your sky)

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love is here to stay

Come on come on
Don't you be afraid 
Whatever comes tomorrow
My love is here to stay

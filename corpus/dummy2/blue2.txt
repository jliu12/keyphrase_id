Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just like him inside and outside is his house with a little window
And a corvette
And everything is for him and himself
And everybody around
'cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

I'm da ba dee da ba die...

I have a house with a window. is the colour of all that I wear. are the streets and all the trees are too.
I have a girlfriend and she is so. are the people here that walk around, like my corvette, it's standing outside. are the words I say and what I think. are the feelings that live inside me.

Preface
The drylands of the world have for long been recognized as requiring special attention. They occupy at least 20 million square kilometres of the developing world and support, often in an impoverished state, nearly half a billion pastoralists and small farmers, who attempt to wrest a livelihood from these fragile environments.
The many issues involved in drylands development were examined by the FAO Drylands Development Working Group, and a number of key aspects, which are summarized in this document, were identified. This exercise drew upon a number of earlier initiatives by FAO, of which two in particular deserve mention. In 1987 a drylands development paper was prepared for the FAO Committee on Agriculture, and in 1989 an International Cooperative Programme Framework for Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development was launched by FAO. The publication of this work is timely, as the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro during 1992 gave high priority to the development of these areas.
The task of coordinating the preparation of this document was delegated to the Farm Management and Production Economics Service in FAO. The actual drafting of this document was undertaken by Messrs. D. J. Pratt and G. Knowles, who faced the challenge of synthesizing the rich and diverse experience of drylands development in different parts of the world.
This document makes available to developing nations a synthesis of the key aspects of strategies for sustainable development of dryland areas. This summary is intended to be used as a checklist when assessing the adequacy of existing strategies, or during the formulation of new strategies. It should be recognized, however, that piecemeal, uncoordinated development actions have little chance of alleviating poverty and controlling natural resource degradation in these areas. The sustainable development of the drylands demands, instead, concerted and systematic effort along the lines advocated in this document.

Executive summary
The objectives of this document are to bring to bear on the drylands of the world the attention and the inputs needed to replace increasing degradation and deprivation with more sustainable and secure forms of land and resource utilization. The drylands, defined as those areas with fewer than 120 growing days per year, extend over at /east 20 million square kilometres and are inhabited by a population which approaches 500 million.
This summary of the key aspects of a strategy is derived from the policy paper 'Improving Productivity of Dryland Areas' presented to the FAO Committee on Agriculture during 1987, and is a further step in elaborating the 'Long-Term Strategy for the Food and Agriculture Sector' presented at the FAO Conference during 1989.
This document is intended to guide national bodies in the assessment and revision of strategies for the sustainable development of drylands. Only at the national and sub-national levels can strategies be formulated which are appropriate to local circumstances and that focus inputs and actions in an effective way to safeguard natural resources and help alleviate poverty.
This approach emphasizes institutional reform before technological solutions. The evidence shows that, in most instances, technology alone cannot control dryland degradation - improved management and institutions are essential features of successful dryland development.
The key aspects, or components, of improved drylands development strategies are as follows:
Preconditions for Development
* Relief of population pressure
* Political commitment
* Marketing and rural infrastructure
Organization and Targeting of Development
* Organizational and staff efficiency
* Community participation
* Security of tenure
* Research
* Development planning
Food Production and Range Resource Management
* Drought and food security
* Soil and water conservation
* Livestock and range management
* Fuel and agro-forestry
These key aspects are not listed in order of priority but according to extent of applicability. For instance, range management may appear low on the list, considering that less than 10 per cent of the drylands are cropped. However, a large part of rangelands is extremely arid, and no more than 10 per cent of the total dryland population are pastoralists. It is for national authorities to establish priorities among these elements, whilst bearing in mind that all aspects on the above list are potentially important and that a systematic approach is essential.
A central precondition for development is the assignment of a high priority to drylands improvement, in keeping with the prevalence of poverty and the extent of natural resource degradation in these areas. The opportunity cost of the redeployment of resources, in terms of the other zones and sectors that thereby receive less attention, must be weighed against the cost of not taking action - of increasing food aid, declining productivity, desert encroachment and even social and political unrest.
The most costly precondition for drylands development is undoubtedly the provision of the rural infrastructure which is required to ensure the delivery of the necessary inputs and services. Even with cost-effective designs, substantial external support may be needed for the establishment of this infrastructure. The relief of population pressure on natural resources is the remaining precondition for the development of most drylands, which should be considered in the context of national plans for other zones and sectors. If action to reduce population pressure on dryland resources is not taken now, the ultimate cost will be much higher and the effectiveness of other development inputs will be limited and shortlived.
The key aspects relating to the organization and targeting of development do not necessarily require heavy investment, although an overall expansion of the drylands development effort may well require additional resources. The general principles which should guide agricultural development in favourable areas also apply to development efforts in the drylands such as focusing on the needs Of specific areas and communities, operating a unified extension service, ensuring community participation, giving research a farming systems perspective and designing incremental and flexible development programmes - and may even save money. Moreover, governments should not underestimate how much can be accomplished by the effective leadership and motivation of existing institutions.
Improved development planning, starting with a national strategy for drylands development and focusing thereafter on specific zones and communities, is essential. Adequate time must be allowed for securing effective participation of local communities in the planning process. Sound planning also requires improved information and early warning systems. Another key aspect of a strategy is ensuring appropriate tenure - particularly adequate security - for small-holders and pastoralists. The strengthening of dryland agricultural research, with a farming systems research and development approach, is a final aspect of the organization and targeting of dryland development activities. The costs of these elements will depend on the overall time frame and scope of the drylands development strategy.
More specific inputs to food production and range resource management require, for full effectiveness, prior action in the fields already noted. First priority needs to be given to inputs that arrest land degradation and improve food security. This implies more than the better organization of food aid and the strengthening of drought strategies. It also calls for adaptive research and extension related to livestock, range and crops, including agroforestry, which combine efficiency of water use with other attributes needed for present and future food security, such as soil and water conservation and the provision of fuel and fodder.
Improvement in pastoral areas requires a long-term perspective and coordinated, phased inputs. There is little scope for introducing more productive grazing techniques until an effective grazing management system has been established with local pastoralists; and such new techniques may be of little value in the absence of complimentary marketing and veterinary services. Long-term research and development plans are needed which take into account the certainty, but unpredictability, of both good seasons and droughts. Mobility has been a fundamental necessity for survive/ in many range/ends, and thus sedentarization requires careful planning if it is not to accentuate deprivation and land degradation.
The responsibility for action rests mainly with national authorities, though active community participation should be sought in planning, managing and implementing development actions. In formulating and implementing dry/ends development strategies, authorities need to ensure complementarity with development strategies for other zones and sectors. Recognizing the need for balanced development, plans for non-dry/and areas and nonagricultural sectors should take into account the inhabitants of the drylands; and, finally, it is maintained that the drylands warrant substantially more attention than they have normally received in the past.
Introduction
The present document reflects concern for the pressures being placed on the drylands of the world--and particularly for the resulting human and environmental degradation -- and a felt need for a framework to prioritize and coordinate action by national and international authorities. The characteristics of the drylands are described more fully in the Annex, but in principle they are considered to be those lands with less than 120 growing days per year.
A succession of reviews of needs, issues and development experience in the drylands has been produced over the past 20 years. FAO has contributed to this process from the outset, by participating in the formulation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere programme and later in UNEP's desertification conference ( 1 977), and by organizing the 1974 consultations and subsequent programme on the Ecological Management of Arid and Semi-Arid Rangelands (EMASAR). More recently, following reviews of development experience by the World Bank and others, FAO placed before its Committee on Agriculture (COAG) during 1987 a policy paper on 'Improving Productivity of Dryland Areas'. This COAG paper is reasonably comprehensive and was taken as the starting point for this examination of dryland development experience.
The present document recognizes the constraints and development actions identified in the COAG paper, and identifies 12 key aspects of strategies, grouped in three categories, for the sustainable development of drylands. With the exception of identifying several preconditions for development, priorities are not indicated among the key aspects since their relative importance will depend on country circumstances and ongoing programmes. Instead of prejudging priorities, it is considered more useful to indicate the who and how of actions. Also, the proposed action areas are discussed in terms of their relevance to international agencies, regional bodies, national authorities and local entities.
Although the document builds upon the COAG paper, it is also one step in the elaboration of the 'Long-Term Strategy for the Food and Agriculture Sector' which was considered at the FAO Conference during 1989. This Conference document recognized the different issues and needs of high and low potential lands. In as much as low potential lands are predominantly drylands, the present document addresses the needs of the low potential lands. The emphasis is placed on the agricultural sector, but with concern also for identifying points of contact and inter-dependencies with other sectors.

Scope and objectives
These key aspects of dryland development strategies are intended to guide and stimulate sustainable agricultural and rural development in the drylands of the world, particularly in areas where people are poor and land is degraded. The aim of such strategies is to encourage forms of land use and resource utilization that are both sustainable and helpful in the short-term in alleviating poverty and arresting or reversing processes of land degradation.
Specifically, the presentation of these key aspects of dryland development strategies seeks to improve the effectiveness of development, by removing political and organizational constraints, providing a social and economic environment conducive to development, improving community participation and delivery systems, and providing the data and understanding necessary for effective development planning. There is emphasis on food crops and livestock production, and on other means of improving food security, but with attention also to resource management and to conserving the ecological and genetic diversity of remaining natural ecosystems.
Drylands are chosen for attention because of the low level of priority and inputs that these areas generally receive in relation to their size, population and need. In order to focus on the main areas of need, both commercial ranching and major irrigation schemes are not considered. This is not to imply that such enterprises are to be excluded from drylands development, but that opportunities for new schemes are limited and that requirements for their development are documented elsewhere. Indeed, the approach followed in this document assumes that development will be planned within a national framework that ensures complementary development between areas and enterprises. Certainly carefully planned irrigation schemes can contribute greatly to development in neighbouring drylands.
This document is intended for use by governments and international organizations, to guide and encourage them in the preparation of their strategies for drylands development. The target is principally developing countries, where the need is greatest, but other drylands are not excluded. Countries with diverse conditions may find it necessary to produce distinct though complementary regional strategies for different areas in order to reflect the specific development needs of different areas.

Key aspects
Preconditions for development
Organization and targeting of development
Farm production and range resource management
The key aspects of dryland development strategies which are described here cover the principal elements that need to be addressed when assessing or formulating strategies for these areas. Such strategies should meet the immediate needs of dryland populations, especially in respect of poverty alleviation, and secure longer term improvement in the management of cropland and rangeland resources. Each key aspect needs to be considered to ascertain its importance for the particular setting, and if relevant, to ensure that it will be addressed in the dryland development strategy or within other national strategies. It should be noted that training and manpower development is not given the status of a separate element, but should be considered where relevant under each key aspect.
The key aspects are grouped in three categories. The preconditions for development are especially important to dryland development and so are explicitly stated. Their importance lies in the fact that drylands, despite degradation and difficult living conditions, are often low on the scale of political priorities. This may not apply in countries that are wholly or mainly dryland, but elsewhere dryland development needs seldom determine national policies and priorities; more usually, drylands are considered problem areas, warranting a small share of social services and agricultural budgets and rising on the political agenda only at times of famine or civil strife.
The second group of key aspects relates to the organization and targeting of development, and again addresses issues that are not unique to drylands. However, they assume specific forms in the drylands context. The emphasis throughout is on targeting designated areas and communities. This involves change both in normal government procedures and organization, and in project and programme design, substituting locally-targeted incremental development for ambitious and fixed term projects. Central to the whole theme is community participation in the development process, and the gathering of adequate information for sound development planning.
The components grouped under farm production and range resource management relate specifically to drylands and cover issues and inputs arising from the seasonality, fragility and insecurity of that environment. The focus lies on the resource base and technical interventions to improve and sustain farm and range productivity, within the context of the institutional improvements identified above. These aspects could be expanded to cover nonagricultural sectors -- including wildlife conservation and tourism, mineral exploitation and industrial development -- but these are considered too specialized for inclusion here. They do, however, offer local employment opportunities (among other benefits) and so can contribute to relieving pressure on drylands as well as generating income. Certainly such dryland strategies needs to link with those for other areas and sectors.
Preconditions for development
Relief of Population Pressure
Rapid population growth in recent decades has overloaded the drylands beyond their capacity, even under improved agriculture. Population growth has a fundamental bearing on food and agriculture world-wide and, in most developing countries, sustainable agriculture will only be feasible if population pressure on natural resources is reduced. Each area of land under a subsistence form of land use has a maximum population support capacity, and if that capacity is exceeded then the land is over-exploited and degradation results. In the case of the drylands, where the environment is especially fragile, the human support capacity is low and the chances of over-exploitation are greater.
Unless there is commitment to reducing population growth, at both government and community level, then any strategies implemented to alleviate poverty and increase production will only be short-term and unsustainable, leading ultimately to further degradation of resources by pressure of agriculture and increasing livestock numbers.
Family planning may not always be immediately acceptable and, even where it is, it may take years for the effects to be substantially realized. Nonetheless, it has a central role in reducing the future difficulties of the drylands. It is therefore a matter of urgency that governments accelerate the implementation of national family planning programmes. Both commitment and sensitivity are needed to overcome the array of religious, social and technical obstacles that face effective family planning and to design programmes adapted to local conditions. In the drylands, where families are often remote from services and dependent on a large family labour force, it may well be essential to link rural services for family planning to health clinics and dispensaries.
The provision of health and education services is generally inadequate in the drylands, and especially so for pastoral populations because of their low population density and mobility. This general deficiency in health, education and social services warrants early attention, with consideration in pastoral areas for special arrangements such as mobile health clinics and schools (even if such mobility incurs extra expense). The education of children will encourage emigration to higher potential areas. Even basic adult education can be expected to facilitate adoption of improved agricultural practices; and, in the case of women, to lower the risk of infant mortality.
Resettlement, on the other hand, facilitates the provision of such services at reasonable cost, but is not always easy to implement. Few countries have vacant land readily available, so resettlement often depends on irrigation development. Nonetheless, where over-population is acute there may be no alternative to resettlement, and the option certainly needs careful study as an integral part of national development planning.
The main responsibility for programmes addressing the population issue rests with national authorities. However, local community participation is essential for successful implementation. The international community can contribute significantly with advisory and material support.
Political Commitment
A lack of political commitment to rural development, particularly to drylands, has sometimes been observed. Many governments give first priority to national defence and security, or to political reform or basic infrastructure, and these are exclusively national decisions. Nevertheless, in situations where the majority of a country's population are subsistence farmers, national security and social amenity have little meaning if the rural population is not able to produce the food it needs to survive. Thus, the political attention and the resources given to agriculture and land use management in the drylands should be proportionate to the developmental problems located in these areas.
Political will is a prerequisite. If the development of dryland areas is a high priority, then the formulation and implementation of an effective development strategy if feasible; and the key aspects of dryland development enumerated below become relevant. Without the requisite political will to develop dryland areas, progress is impossible and the prospect is one of worsening resource degradation and human deprivation. An essential corollary is that political will must be translated into enabling legislation and the provision of necessary resources. It is also fundamentally important that developments initiated should be sustainable, not only ecologically but organizationally, socially and financially.
Adequate planning data are needed to guide political decisions. There are few opportunities for quick-fix solutions in the development of drylands and, although such prospects have political appeal, politicians should ensure that decisions are taken only after adequate planning based on sufficient reliable data. Time and resources need to be given to planning, as well as to policy formulation and the implementation of development.
Legislation, as well as resources, may be needed to translate political decision into action. Sometimes the need is over-stated -- and lack of legislation can be more an excuse than a reason for inactivity at ground level--but at least basic land use legislation is required to limit destructive practices and to enable the establishment of local organizations with legal powers and responsibilities for the management of land and other resources.
Responsibility for action lies with national authorities. International agencies can provide advice and assistance for improving land use data and planning capacity.
Marketing and Rural Infrastructure
Inappropriate price policy, particularly for animal products, and lack of effective input and marketing services are major constraints to improving productivity of drylands. There has been, of course, considerable attention to 'getting prices right' during the past decade of structural adjustment in many developing countries. This issue assumes special significance in the drylands which often suffer high transportation and servicing costs, yet have often lacked the political influence to attract substantial subsidies.
The terms of trade for dryland products are a major determinant of production levels. In principle, policies should be adopted which encourage the free operation of agricultural input and product markets in order to provide appropriate incentives to producers and to encourage investment in farm and range improvement. In some countries this implies finding other means for supporting the urban poor than through cheapfood policies which tax dryland producers. At the same time, care is needed not to subsidize dryland producers and thereby to encourage the extension of cropping into marginal areas where it cannot be sustained or, through subsidized animal feed or water, the maintenance of excessive livestock numbers that are destructive of rangeland.
Efficient input and product markets are important but they are only one factor in a package including research, extension and other essential rural services. Among essential services are storage, marketing and market information, transport and supplies of inputs as well as credit and banking facilities. The support to the development of rural service centres is one option in the process of improvement of the drylands.
Action required is as follows:
* Efficiently functioning agricultural input and product markets should be seen as a means of improving the performance of the agriculture sector, without encouraging deleterious land use.
* Rural service centres are often an important component of rural development, and in the drylands, where population is generally widely dispersed, they assume even greater importance. The provision of centres might include:
* facilities for the off-take and marketing of crops and livestock, including grain stores and livestock holding grounds;
* access to these facilities assured by a programme of upgrading or construction of roads;
* input services for the supply of fertilizers, seed, pesticides and stock medicines, and for the servicing of transport and water supply points;
* banking and rural credit facilities which recognize the generally weak economic position and special needs of producers; and
* mobile units, where economic, to ensure that essential services are available in outlying areas.
* Consideration should be given to consolidating at these service centres all appropriate health and extension services and involving the communities in their design and management.
* Agricultural cooperatives and other forms of local farmers' and pastoralists' organizations play an important role in increasing local participation in the development process. Governments should ensure that training and guidance in the formative stages are freely and readily available, and that access to finance is assured. Where such organizations exist, they should be encouraged to take management responsibility for the operation of rural service centres.
* High priority should be given to securing donor funding and private investment for the establishment of rural service centres, including commercial services such as banking, marketing and supply services. The location of such centres should take into account the tendency for the concentration of human and animal populations to lead to degradation in the vicinity of the centres.
Main responsibility lies with national governments, with substantial involvement by local communities in identifying local needs and in ensuring successful implementation of the initiatives taken. International donor assistance will be necessary in funding of storage, markets and access, but the private sector should also be encouraged to undertake at least some of these ventures.
Organization and targeting of development
Organizational and Staff Efficiency
One constraint to dryland development is the lack of technical and administrative staff to ensure changes in drylands, and poor reward systems, living conditions and career prospects in rural areas. Some major agencies have noted the existence of a wider and deeper malaise in public administration than simply a shortage of trained staff. In essence, the problem is that many institutions and staff are ineffective, due variously to imprecise mandates, counter-productive staffing procedures and inadequate guidance, facilities and motivation. The problem is magnified in drylands in so far as postings in these areas are often regarded as punishment stations.
Actions required, in total or in part depending on country or organizational circumstances, are as follows:
* Government departments should be organized to ensure a comprehensive service appropriate to each production zone. Adequate status for drylands development will require the establishment of a drylands department or an authoritative policy and coordinating body to service this area. Departmental mandates should be defined in accordance with expected functions and results.
* Rural service centres should be maintained at the local or community level in order to provide a focal source of advice and inputs.
* Staffing policy and conditions of service should attract and retain quality staff in rural areas as well as at headquarters, and should reward merit and assist non-productive staff to leave the service. Arrangements should be considered to allow technical staff to be seconded to the service of local organizations.
* Accountability should be introduced at all levels in the service. Departmental heads should be provided with training in leadership and field staff with training in rural appraisal and farming systems analysis. Universities and other institutes of higher learning (particularly those concerned with public administration and the agricultural sciences) should be encouraged to provide a grounding in systems research and development approaches.
Main responsibility in the areas listed rests with national authorities, though international agencies and bilateral and other donors can help in providing organization and management expertise and training courses.
Community Participation
It is essential to involve the community and local leadership in designing and maintaining development efforts. In reality, it is participation in the development process that is required, not just consultation; it requires a positive approach to building farmers' groups and community organizations that can exercise increasing influence on land management and development.
Action required is as follows:
* Local bodies need to be identified or occasionally created, and supported, which are representative of the people at the level at which development is to be implemented. These are required as points of contact in development planning and as recipient bodies and partners in development, within which management capability and responsibility can be fostered.
* The bodies so identified or created should be involved from the outset in dialogue and decision-making regarding the whole of the development process. As great a degree of management responsibility as is possible should be vested in the local bodies concerned, and special efforts should be made to give training in required management skills to individuals nominated by the community, as well as ensuring a broad level of understanding throughout the community concerning the development envisaged. A position of trust and cooperation needs to be established between local bodies and government representatives.
Main responsibility for initiating community participation in the development process rests with national authorities, but non-governmental organizations can assist with implementation. Other agencies can help by making available to national authorities external experience in the formation of corporate organizations at the local level. The precise nature of these organizations will vary between pastoral and agricultural situations, and according to the focus of development and the political system to which the country concerned adheres.
Security of Tenure
A lack of security of land tenure is a constraint which calls for policy decisions. Access to land and other resources is a major primary determinant of rural incomes and welfare, and those who do not have security of land tenure are deprived both of security of subsistence and of opportunity to improve their lot. Normally adequate security of tenure implies allocation (or re-allocation) of land under government licence or title. This also has the advantage of allowing government to oversee and encourage better land management by the user.
Land redistribution and tenancy reform are fundamental means of alleviating rural poverty, and although some countries have attempted to introduce such measures, the history of land reform includes many failures. The 1979 World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (WCARRD) concluded that developing countries should give priority to the adoption of institutional frameworks and farming structures which allow more equitable access by the rural population to land, water and other natural resources.
When initiating land reform, it is desirable that proposals for reform should involve consultation with the farmers and pastoralists concerned, whether the proposals are for land redistribution, resettlement, the granting of permanent rights or modification of customary rights. However, it is important that the initiative in land allocation is retained by government. A laissez-faire policy that allows uncontrolled immigration and settlement is to be avoided.
The case for private land title is often argued in terms of its value as collateral for credit, but the credit system itself often needs reform. Land reform in the drylands may involve group title or forms of individual licence other than freehold title. In some areas, granting of individual titles to land can lead to accelerated marginalization of those with the least secure customary rights and the smallest holdings.
Action required is as follows:
* There should be a political commitment to land reform as a means of alleviating rural poverty and improving and sustaining production. Since the legal and administrative processes involved are often time-consuming, attention should be paid to streamlining procedures in order to reach smaller and poorer clientele in remote dryland areas.
* The proposed beneficiaries (farmers and pastoralists) should be involved in the planning and implementation of the programme, preferably through local community organizations.
* Redistribution of land for cropping should usually be to individual small-holders, whether men or women; pastoral land is often better allocated on group title or licence.
* Additional schemes which assist in alleviation of poverty and add to productivity are essential to supplement land reform programmes, particularly in those countries where rural poverty is most serious. These may include improved access to credit, government encouragement and assistance in the formation of cooperatives and services, provision of improved extension services and training, and improved access to markets (in addition to employment and other income generating schemes).
Main responsibility lies with the national governments but international agencies can play an important role in providing expertise in organization, management and training.
Research
A lack of applicable research results suggests giving priority to applied and adaptive research in agriculture, forestry and hydrology. It is currently much debated whether or not there is sufficient available technology to support drylands development. Some argue acute deficiency on the grounds that technology is not available unless it is already proven by uptake by farmers or pastoralists. But most would agree that, in many circumstances, some practicable and useful interventions can be prescribed locally following a thorough analysis of the farming system concerned - this may well involve repackaging or adapting experience or technology to fit the specific system.
The term farming systems implies all forms of natural resource utilization, including crop agriculture, agro-forestry and woodlots, beekeeping, fish farming, livestock production, range management, hunting and gathering and all combinations of these.
The required analysis of farming systems involves determining the relationships between resources, crop production, livestock husbandry, household activities and off farm employment, and household objectives. With this analysis one can identify any immediate opportunities for technology transfer, other non-technical interventions and priorities for further research; without it any research that is undertaken has doubtful relevance.
Good applications of the farming systems approach use the initial analysis to project likely development paths, and then tests promising interventions under real farm or pastoral conditions while also pursuing necessary component research outside the system. This combines systems research with systems development. In coastal areas, farming systems research would need to give due attention also to the marine component of natural resource utilization, though fisheries development per se is usually considered as being marginal to the mainstream of drylands development.
This approach subordinates work undertaken on research stations to farming systems research and development undertaken directly in farming and pastoral areas. It is the latter which should dictate the former, not the reverse.
Actions required include the following:
* Research structures and programmes should be organized to meet the needs of the principal farming systems of each major agro-ecological zone in the drylands. Where resources require concentration of effort to the exclusion of important areas and systems, priority should be given to those supporting the largest and most needy populations. Where research institutes currently focus exclusively on commodities or disciplines, redeployment and revision of mandate is indicated, to bring together interdisciplinary teams focused on specific systems.
* Capability in farming systems research should be increased through selective training (especially of potential team leaders). It is important that research (and development) teams are able to tap local knowledge, making use of modern participatory analysis techniques. Institutional linkages should be formed between systems research teams and the staff of local service centres in order to secure the input of the latter to the analysis of problems and development opportunities.
* A substantial research component is necessary in most drylands development programmes. National research programmes can draw upon the results and support of regional and international research centres. In addition to the farming systems perspective, continuing selection and breeding of dryland crops are important and the evaluation and conservation of the ecological and genetic resources of remaining natural ecosystems.
* Monitoring of change is needed in all principal agro-ecological and farming system zones, in order to quantify ecological, land use and socio-economic trends. Monitoring by remote sensing and ground survey is one essential component.
Responsibility for ensuring adequate research is shared between national authorities and international and regional bodies. Some of the more specific themes of research that could most profitably be pursued in the drylands are indicated later.
Development Planning
Development planning for the drylands usually suffers from the lack of an integrated approach and insufficient assessment of natural resources of land, water and vegetation. Thus, the joint planning and phased implementation of dryland development efforts is required, and further surveys of natural resources and farming systems.
These concerns stem from the disappointing performance of the majority of the larger drylands development projects. It is not proposed here to review past development experience in detail, but there is a consensus that a large part of the problem lies in project design. The tendency has been towards overly-ambitious and time-constrained programmes and projects that have been planned and implemented from the top down, rather than building on local structures and management capabilities. Most projects claim to have involved local study and consultation but clearly to an inadequate degree. Indeed, deficiencies in planning data extend far beyond natural resource information. Usually there has been lack of demographic data and of understanding of local value systems and management practices.
Actions required relate both to planning data and to project and programme design.
* If there is one priority above all else in drylands development strategies, it is to ensure adequate planning data. The starting point should be a zonation at the national level into development analysis domains, characterized according to agro-ecology, population, broad categories of farming system and other major factors determining development potential and priority (e.g., disputed territory and, in Africa, areas infested by tsetse flies). This zonation serves to place drylands in their national context and helps establish the location of areas and opportunities for sustainable development. It also helps identify opportunities for productive linkages between zones (e.g., between dryland livestock development and irrigation schemes or rainfed cropping zones).
* Areas scheduled for early development should be surveyed and mapped in more detail (at map scales of 1:50,000-1:500,000, compared with the national donation at scales of 1:200,000-1:2 million). In the absence of suitable topographic maps, satellite imagery can provide an alternative base as well as inputs to thematic mapping. Use can be made of earlier surveys and maps, particularly in respect of ecology, but up-to-date information is needed on population distribution and dynamics (both for people and livestock), social-territorial organization and farming and livestock production systems. Information should be sought from both local staff and the local community. Unless use is made of accumulated local experience, field studies have to extend over several years in order to embrace the spread of conditions needed to assess drought strategies.
* Particular attention should be given to the identification of sites, however restricted, where water harvesting or shallow groundwater can be harnessed for irrigation. Even a single irrigated field can significantly improve household food security in the drylands.
* All new development initiatives should:
* focus on defined (and adequately researched) areas and communities;
* ensure local participation, preferably through existing community organizations;
* phase development activities and inputs within a long term perspective of development that takes account of the total needs, current and future, of the areas and communities concerned;
* ensure that inputs relate to the needs of individual production systems and cover essential infrastructure;
* envisage incremental as well as sustainable development, starting with inputs that are deemed helpful but safe in terms of possible environmental consequences;
* avoid heavy dependence on concurrent inputs, at least initially and where inputs have major organizational or management demands;
* include provision for staff and farmer training;
* include provision for the annual review and monitoring of progress, by national authorities and community organizations; and
* make subsequent phases conditional upon initial progress, as measured in terms of targets, the results of monitoring and the ability of research to define appropriate inputs.
Main responsibility rests with national authorities but with input throughout from local communities and organizations. Development planning is very situation-specific, but valuable support in pre-development survey and training can be offered by international and regional organizations.

Farm production and range resource management
Drought and Food Security
Low and erratic precipitation is certainly the key characteristic of the drylands; and thus droughts are a critical feature of dryland areas which must be reflected in development strategies. Aspects which might be considered include food reserves, food distribution before farmers are forced to liquidate their assets, improved crop and livestock forecasting, and the development of appropriate technologies. It is, of course, not only unpredictability that causes the problem but the fact that drought periods reduce production below the already marginal levels so that subsistence itself is in jeopardy.
In this situation, food security is a paramount consideration and especially for the majority whose access to resources is limited and whose incomes are low. And although new technology may help, alone it cannot increase the stability of food production so as to guarantee food security for the poor. When droughts strike, direct intervention by government may therefore be necessary through price subsidies for basic food commodities, feeding programmes targeting specific sectors of the population, or income-generating programmes to assist the disadvantaged. To facilitate such programmes, adequate grain storage is also needed, both centrally and locally, in order to build up and maintain drought reserves and, in areas of acute risk, to accommodate external food aid. Food aid can be crucial during food emergencies, and when distribution systems are adequate and food reaches the targeted population with minimum delay, it can significantly assist the poor and disadvantaged.
However, recurrent famine relief certainly indicates a need for resettlement.
General prescriptions are inappropriate - each situation needs to be evaluated on its own merits. In particular, a distinction needs to be drawn between areas where improved crop technology can improve help, over-populated areas that are beyond technological help and pastoral areas where special drought strategies apply (mobility, drought reserves of grazing and fodder, and emergency marketing of livestock in exchange for grain). Opportunities for symbiotic development between drylands and well-watered lands also need to be assessed, and early warning systems need to be established in order to anticipate impending drought and famine.
Where crop technology can help, it is most likely to be through water conservation and crop varieties (developed through a marriage of farming systems research and plant breeding) that combine water efficiency with the other attributes required for food security. The latter include disease and pest resistance both in the field and in storage and, often, the ability to provide feed for the livestock which, in marginal cropping areas, provide extra security of subsistence in the face of crop failure. Whatever other inputs and strategies are employed, active encouragement should be given to improving on-farm crop storage. Food losses, both in quantity and quality, occur at all stages of the post-harvest system. Although grain losses are often lower in the drylands than in more humid areas, they sometimes are large enough to present the opportunity of improve food security through their reduction.
Action required is as follows:
* Governments should recognize that their policies in the areas of money and credit, exchange rates, marketing and trade all impinge on food security. Governments should also recognize, in their agricultural planning and financial allocations, the special needs of the drylands for development and infrastructure for building food security, e.g., storage, access, etc.
* Drought and food strategies need to be developed appropriate to each area at risk. It is particularly important to understand the traditional coping strategies of farmers and pastoralists, and the communities should be encouraged to identify areas of need and to participate fully in the planning process.
* Needs for food aid should be minimized by development programmes that seek to increase the productivity of small farmers through better distribution of resources, including land, improved availability of credit and access to low-cost technologies and extension services, all aimed at sustainable incremental increases in production.
* Where food aid is anticipated, close collaboration is required between governments and donors in the design of food strategies, including necessary infrastructure. It is a government responsibility to ensure that food aid reaches the targeted recipients with minimum delay, but this can be assisted by the donor providing non-food resources and support to the administrative and physical infrastructure.
* Emphasis in crop research and technology should be given to varieties and cultural techniques that enhance food security by combining water efficiency with other valuable attributes, such as pest resistance and straw/stover production for animal feed.
* Early warning systems should be developed, combining remote sensing with a network of ground recording sites which take into account socio-economic as well as technological parameters.
Main responsibility lies with national authorities, but with substantial inputs from the international community in terms of food and non-food aid and in the development of early warning systems. Local communities and organizations should participate in the design, implementation and management of food strategies. There are also major opportunities for regional collaboration in developing and implementing drought strategies, including early warning systems, cross-border movement of livestock and exchange of food surpluses.
Soil and Water Conservation
Both widespread soil erosion and declining soil fertility are constraints to improving productivity of drylands. Water conservation is also an issue in the drylands, which by definition have limited rainfall for plant growth or to replenish groundwater. Moreover, soil erosion and water run-off are intimately related. The root causes of degradation and erosion are addressed through other aspects of dryland strategies; this section deals with actions specific to soil and water conservation.
Action required:
* Inventories of soil and water resources at the national level should be assured and updated as a basis for national policies, strategies and programmes in soil and water conservation. These inventories should adequately cover the drylands and should include delineation of the extent and risk of soil erosion and of high erosion risk and quantification of groundwater resources in terms of depth, quantity, quality and recharge.
* Soil conservation services should be organized so that input can be made to area and community development projects and programmes, as well as to national planning and large-scale watershed management. Emphasis should be given to farm-level inputs that provide tangible benefits to farmers through increased yield or reduced risk.
* Policies and strategies should be developed for the utilization of water resources. Particular attention should be given to policies regarding the utilization (mining) of fossil groundwater, wherever major reserves occur, to establish the use to which these are to be put and the time scale for their exploitation.
* Legislation and sanctions are often needed to control grossly degrading land use and indiscriminate or anti-social exploitation of water resources. Scarcity of water is a constraint to drylands development and controls or incentive schemes to ensure efficient use of available resources are therefore imperative, especially in respect of irrigation.
* Research and extension are needed to ensure improved efficiency of water use in irrigation schemes, particularly in the case of small-scale irrigation drawing on limited water sources. Apart from water-efficient crop varieties, the use of water-saving irrigation technologies should be encouraged. Attention also needs to be given to the environmental problems associated with irrigation (alkalinity and salinity) and the social problems of newly setted irrigation schemes.
* In the drylands generally, pre-development studies and farming systems development should give specific attention to soil and water conservation and the maintenance of soil fertility, through tillage systems, water harvesting, agroforestry, crop rotations and the increased use of manure.
Main responsibility lies with national governments, though few countries will be able to undertake the required programmes without the assistance of external agencies and the donor community. Regional institutions can also help with training and information exchange.
Livestock and Range Resource Management
Overgrazing is a widespread constraint to the sustainable development of drylands, requiring inputs to improve animal husbandry, livestock off-take and the integration of grazing control with water development. However, overgrazing is but a syndrome, and the true causes are embedded in the nature of pastoral livestock production. The central issue, therefore, is how to increase the reliability and output of livestock production systems, including enhancing forage production by preventing unnecessary grass fires and applying phosphatic fertilizers to legumes, while also avoiding or correcting land degradation.
In practice, different strategies are needed for different livestock production systems (with different ecologies and/or socio-political systems). Clearly, crop-livestock production systems offer opportunities for producing forage (in the form of straw and stover as well as catch crops and planted pasture) that are lacking in pastoral systems. Rarely is the seeding or fertilizing of rangeland an attractive development option, and reliance has to be placed instead on making the most of natural plant growth. This includes maintaining mobility, and protecting pasture stands from unwanted fire. Sometimes, however, fire can be a useful tool for thinning unwanted bush and controlling tsetse flies, provided it is planned within a grazing rotation.
Actions required include, first, the adoption of a farming systems approach and, second, ensuring local organizations have management responsibility. Development planning can then proceed with reference to the following interventions. Sedentarization of pastoralists is not included because anything that restricts mobility, at least in the arid zone, is invariably detrimental to livestock, rangeland and family security.
* Drought and dry season feed reserves are a priority in terms of livestock production, but can cause overstocking and destruction of rangeland if purchased feed is used to maintain excessive grazing pressure on rangeland. Reserves are therefore best organized on the basis of what can be produced within the one management unit. Government subsidies on feed brought into drylands are especially destructive and are best avoided.
* Expansion of grazing area is rarely an available option, except where land is under-utilized for lack of water or presence of tsetse flies. Such areas are strategically very important but should be opened to grazing only when control of land use is assured.
* Livestock marketing is an important option for both increasing returns to producers and reducing grazing pressure. Special arrangements should be made for marketing animals during drought, ideally before animals lose too much condition and value. Improved marketing is also one means of altering the relative profitability of different livestock species or breeds, and thus encouraging a particular type of enterprise.
* Veterinary services are a necessary adjunct to marketing and, if available where and when required, make it possible for pastoralists to secure reliable subsistence from a smaller number of animals. However, the service does need to be reliable and available locally. To the extent possible, livestock owners should be assisted to undertake their own routine animal health care.
* Grazing management can also be helpful to both production and rangeland. Traditional management systems, effective in the past, are breaking down, and need to be reinstated or revised. Pastoral organizations should be established to foster local management capability and responsibility, but where grazing rights are disputed government may need to intervene. Management systems should be kept as simple as possible initially, and full use should be made of local knowledge in devising management plans. A division into grazing blocks, and formal rotational grazing, are likely to come sooner rather than later where fire control or periodic burning for bush-control is required.
* Technical interventions of a more specific nature should be withheld until the institutional framework to apply and maintain them has been established. Promising technologies need to be tested through farming systems research and development before being extended. The one exception, for implementation on a trial and error basis, is the establishment of fuel and forage woodlots. Both breed improvement and further water development should be withheld until mechanisms are in place to ensure feed supply and local grazing control.
Main responsibility lies with national authorities to secure the planning studies required. Community and producer participation should be ensured and the private sector should be encouraged to take the lead in livestock marketing and banking systems for producers. Bilateral and international agencies can help in some of the design work and in advising on specific components of development.
Fuel and Agro-Forestry
Shortages of fuelwood and forage, seasonally, are endemic in the drylands, and often lead to strategy elements such as planting fuelwood and supplementary forage, promoting phosphatic fertilizer use on legumes and organising fire control measures.
Fuelwood remains the principal source of energy for most of the world's rural poor and for many urban dwellers as well. It comprises some 85 percent of the wood used in developing countries and accounts for more than three quarters of total energy consumption in the poorest countries. In the drylands, demand for fuelwood is increasing and supply is rapidly diminishing, with many areas (e.g., North Africa) having already reached a deficit situation. The continuing process of removal of trees and shrubs is accelerating land degradation.
Attempts to reduce household consumption of fuelwood have met with only limited success and will continue to do so until more attractive fuel-saving devices are available and their use is extended to the rural community by women for use by women.
Forestry can play other important roles in the drylands, in the control of soil erosion, ameliorating the environment for food production through shelter belts and windbreaks, in contributing feed for livestock and supplementing the diet of the rural population, both directly in the form of fruits, nuts and leaves, and indirectly through honey and wildlife. Opportunities to benefit from these other roles need to be explored through an expanded programme of agro-forestry research, adapted to different climates and farming systems.
Agro-forestry should be seen as an integral part of future drylands development, at least in the semi-arid zone where it is relatively easy to establish trees. Although the long-term benefits could be considerable, its adoption will require readily available and attractive options, as there could be heavy investment necessary at farm level for initial inputs. In the case of community plantings there is a clear need for specification of ownership rights.
Action required includes the following:
* The important role of dryland forestry in improving agricultural and animal production, and in providing direct economic benefits to local communities, should be recognized at the national level by integrating tree planting and agro-forestry in rural research and development programmes.
* To improve awareness and acceptance, there should be increased emphasis on educational and extension programmes which highlight the importance of forestry in farming and pastoral systems. It is also necessary to devise agro-forestry packages appropriate to different farming and pastoral systems.
* Training of foresters and technicians should cover agro-forestry, and training institutes should include programmes relevant to the particular needs of drylands.
* Community forestry (e.g., village woodlots) should be encouraged by national governments but managed by the local communities with clear specification as to ownership. Farm forestry could be assisted by government subsidies in the establishment phase and by increased extension activity, emphasizing nursery and tree planting skills.
* Substantial savings in the use of fuel wood can be achieved by using more efficient fuel stoves or alternative energy sources such as solar cookers. Action is needed to encourage and demonstrate their use, preferably by women extension workers, and to encourage local manufacture as an additional local industry.
Main responsibility lies with the national governments, but international agencies can play an important role in ensuring that, in any externally funded development programme, agricultural systems and forestry are integrated and that adequate training and extension is available.

Implications for implementation
The key aspects of sustainable dryland development strategies which have been elaborated in the document need to be interpreted and recast by national authorities and other organizations according to local circumstances and organizational mandates. The potential role of local, national, regional and international bodies with respect to each key aspect is indicated in Table 1. in a similar vein, Table 2 relates key aspects to major categories of land and production system, while Table 3 elaborates on where and how international bodies might specifically contribute, in terms both of key aspects and production systems.
An effective strategy is a comprehensive strategy, that addresses central policy and organizational issues as well as specific departmental or disciplinary inputs. Countries with diverse conditions will need separate strategies for different areas. Thus, in a country as agro-ecologically and ethnically diverse as Kenya, five dryland area development strategies might be required to focus the specific inputs and actions on the different needs of each ecology, e.g., the very arid northern rangelands, the more productive southern rangelands, the eastern dryland cropping areas, the lightly populated coastal hinterland (often with tsetse challenge), and the drier highlands. However, most countries would require fewer dryland area development strategies. Moreover, there also needs to be an umbrella strategy in order to ensure the necessary policy and organizational infrastructure and to establish priorities between areas. Likewise, the national drylands strategy has to be
integrated with broader national strategies, in order to ensure complementary development between areas and sectors.
The implications for the UN system of national drylands development strategies lie not in new activities but in coordination and shifts in emphasis. Many UN agencies and other international bodies (e.g., ICRISAT, IGADD, CILSS) have roles to play. However, clearly a lead role in supporting national dryland agricultural development strategies lies with FAO. There are many functions which the UN system could perform in this regard, including the provision, in useful form, of statistical and other arguments in favour of drylands development. A major effort is also required to stimulate more accurate drought forecasting, as an aid to developing better drought strategies and increased food security. There is also a role in facilitating the exchange of germplasm, technology, and development experience between countries.

Definition and classification
The central objective of the key aspects of dryland strategies presented here is to arrest land degradation and promote sustainable development in the drylands of the developing world. Since the term drylands is interpreted in many different ways, a working definition is presented in this annex.
Definition
Drylands embrace both arid and semi-arid lands, as well as more desertic (hyper-arid) areas. These lands are characterized by low and erratic precipitation which is reflected in relatively low and notably unpredictable levels of crop and livestock production. Typically arid areas receive less than 200 mm of winter rainfall annually or less than 400 mm of summer rainfall, while semi-arid areas receive 200 - 500 mm of winter rainfall or 400 - 600 mm of summer rainfall. However, the main feature of their dryness lies less in total precipitation as in the negative balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Drylands have thus been defined as areas where mean annual precipitation is less than half of the potential evapo-transpiration. This in turn is reflected in the number of growing days that constitute the length of the growing period for crops.
Of these various criteria, FAO chose growing days as the relevant criterion, and defines drylands as lands with a growing period of less than 120 days. Within this range, arid lands have less than 75 growing days while semi-arid lands have 75 days or more. The value of using growing days lies partly in the fact that several of the sets of statistics produced by FAO (including population support capacities of different land areas) are grouped according to growing periods rather than by other climatic criteria. For detailed work, especially involving pasture or rangeland, problems can arise from the fact that grass responds to intermittent showers that are not registered as growing days, but that is not a problem at the level of analysis attempted here.
Sustainable development has also been defined in several ways. One succinct definition is 'development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs'. The definition adopted by FAO is as follows:
'Sustainable development is the management and conservation of the natural resource base, and the orientation of technological and institutional change, in such a manner as to ensure the attainment and continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generations. Such sustainable development (in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors) conserves land, water, plant and animal genetic resources, is environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable.'
Land degradation is less frequently subject to definition but in general terms refers to loss of productivity through damage to soil and/or natural vegetation. It implies a loss that is more than ephemeral and is part of a downward trend which has to be reversed if the former or potential level of productivity is to be attained. Land degradation is used here in preference to desertification, since the latter (however it is defined) conjures the image of trend towards desert, which is not helpful to the recognition of degradation in the full range of conditions under which it occurs. However, the present strategy addresses desertification as much as it addresses poverty or any other of the products of over-use or misuse of the drylands.
FAO estimates of land potential are usually calculated for about 100 countries in the developing world. Statistics relating to areas of drylands and their populations frequently omit several countries with substantial tracts of dryland, most notably China and Mongolia but also other countries such as Oman. China specifically is cited because, with a land area of almost 10 million km and a population of around 1 000 million, the omission of that country or any part of it distorts the total picture substantially. There may be over 6 million km of drylands in East Asia.
In global terms the picture that emerges is that the drylands of the developing world total some 20 million km supporting a population in 1975 of around 430 million. Of this population, Africa supports 70 million, Latin America around 40 million and the remaining 320 million are distributed through the Near and Middle East and the rest of Asia including China. Since 1975, these populations may well have increased by a further 15 per cent.
As regards the population support capacity of the drylands, the 1975 population in Africa was already close to the maximum projected as feasible under a high level of inputs (which far exceed present-day inputs). This means that in many areas the support capacity of the land is already far exceeded. In Latin America there is potential to support more people in the drylands, though locally there is already population pressure and especially in the arid zone. For the rest of the developing world, current statistics (or the analysis thereof) permit no generalization. Nonetheless, with a population now approaching 500 million, it would be irresponsible to conclude that there is not a pressing problem.
Global Classification.
Both the term drylands and its antithesis, well-watered lands, emphasize moisture availability rather than climate per se, but they equate closely with the concept of arid and humid climates. Drylands embrace semi-arid, arid and hyper-arid (desert) climates, while well-watered lands embrace sub-humid, humid and hyper-humid climates. Dry sub-humid climates occupy the middle ground and are best held in that position, to be included or excluded from either category depending on circumstances. In reality there is no clear line where water becomes abruptly limiting or non-limiting, and much of a drylands development strategy will apply to dry sub-humid areas.
It follows that all of the world's land surface can be classified either as dry or well-watered, to be sub-divided further according to relative aridity or humidity. Aspects of climate other than moisture availability can be indicated, at the same global level, through a parallel classification based on latitude. The descriptors tropical, temperate and polar help immediately to categorize the type of drylands under consideration. Other parallel classifications can be superimposed (e.g. specifying continent or region), though for purposes of a global strategy it is not helpful to take subdivision too far. It is useful to separate high elevation (mountain) drylands from the rest, and to specify major seaboards (where this confers ease of access by boat and/or fisheries potential), but features such as soil type are better covered by local site descriptions than in a global classification.
Local Classification
Features for categorizing drylands at the local level vary according to whatever local factors determine land use and productivity. Commonly these include:
Climatic factors, expressed in terms not only of annual indices but also of the seasonality of precipitation and of periods too cold or dry for plant growth, including (where statistics allow) probabilities of drought.
Soil and vegetation, with particular reference to the moisture retentivity and erodibility of soils and to the physiognomy of the natural vegetation (i.e. whether annual or perennial grassland or dwarf shrubland, etc., indicating if cover is moderate, sparse or absent but citing genera or species only where these have particular ecological significance).
Land use and population pressure, indicating the prevalence of pastoralism, cropping and other forms of land use, and whether population density is low, moderate or high relative to the population support capacity of the land (also whether the land is disputed between different users or countries).
Other features such as topography, surface and groundwater availability, the extent of land degradation and, in Africa, the presence of tsetse flies; all of which may impact greatly on land use and development.
Where cropping prevails and rangeland is unimportant, an agro-ecological zonation, of the type developed by FAO, could substitute for the above categorization. However, this is inadequate for purposes of range and livestock development since, of the features listed above, the FAO zonation considers only soil type and growing periods for arable crops no more than 10 per cent of the drylands of Africa, Asia and Latin America are in fact cropped.
Responsibility for categorizing drylands according to local conditions and needs rests with national authorities. To attempt that task here would yield a myriad of dryland types which would be confusing in its length and would still omit many gradations and variants that have local significance. However, it is possible to extract four major types which are both radically different one from the other and encapsulate the essence of the drylands problem.
Major Dryland Types
Dry uplands. Although limited in area, mountain and other elevated drylands have a distinctive character. In temperate zones they tend to be inhospitable (though they may provide valuable summer grazing) but in the tropics they are often densely populated. Tropical upland areas are often preferred sites for settlement and, even when arid, are more favourable for living and for crop production than neighbouring lowlands. In such circumstances, they have been foci of settlement and civilization for centuries.
Examples occur in North Yemen and in northern Ethiopia. In the former case, irrigation from groundwater has supplemented more traditional methods of water harvesting and so has helped support a growing population.
In Ethiopia there is less opportunity or tradition of irrigation, and population pressure is more acute. The famines and periodic mass starvation that have affected northern Ethiopia over the past 20 years are too well-known to require description here. More than anywhere else in the world, the dry uplands of northern Ethiopia typify the disaster situation of the drylands; the situation where an excessive population is confined to a limited resource, to the degradation of the land and the complete impoverishment of the people.
Lower elevation dry croplands. More widespread, though still limited in area, is the situation where rangeland has been brought under cultivation. Examples occur in China, India, North Africa and the Middle East, East Africa and the soudano-sahelian zone of West Africa. The designation lower elevation is intended only to differentiate these areas from upland areas; the elevation may be over 1500 m, especially in the heart of continental masses, but on plateaux rather than mountains.
Over such a wide area, dryland cropping is practiced under many ecological and socio-political conditions. Typically the areas concerned are semi-arid but include arid lands also. Expansion of cropping into the arid zone is often a recent response to population pressure and/or mechanization; sometimes with modest success if the sites are well-chosen, but more usually (as in North Africa) with poor crop yields and major land degradation. Where irrigation is feasible, on the other hand, sustained cropping is also feasible, and (as in China) has been practiced for generations.
Although dryland farmers often keep livestock, and may make extensive use of range grazing, crops are usually the basis of subsistence. Development efforts therefore need to focus first and foremost on the croplands, even where these are small in area compared with the associated rangelands. However, livestock production can still be a central component, in terms of draught power and/or manure and also to militate against the climatic risks inherent in dryland cropping.
Arid rangelands. Pastoralism is still the predominant form of land use in the drylands, even though it supports only a minority of the people. Although still practiced in the semi-arid zone (in tropical Africa especially), pastoralism is more characteristic of arid rangeland, where often it represents the only, practicable form of land use. It may involve cropping (agro-pastoralism) but its essential feature is extensive livestock husbandry utilizing range grazing and browse. Arid zone pastoralism requires mobility, with movements determined not only by feed availability but by the availability of drinking water and, in the temperate zone, by temperature.
Pastoralism, much more than settled agriculture, is governed by the environment, and pastoralists form an integral part of the ecosystem. More rain produces more feed which supports more livestock; and more livestock leave less feed for drought periods, which then cause livestock (and sometimes people) to die, until more rain brings more feed again and the cycle is repeated. And the greater the number of pastoral families seeking to maintain a subsistence herd or flock, the greater the probability that overgrazing will reduce the capacity of the range to respond to rain when it comes. In that event the natural cycle becomes a vicious cycle, with increasing land degradation and mortality.
Nor can agricultural inputs such as new varieties and fertilizers offer much hope for alleviating the rigours of pastoralism. Additional water points can serve as a palliative but are no help in the longer term unless used to introduce improved management systems. Only through the more efficient management of available resources -- coupled with marketing and other services (including health and education) adapted to the mobility that pastoralism demands--can a measure of stability be achieved and a framework for further improvement created.
Deserts. This over-used term tends to be applied to the driest areas of any country or region. Many such areas are relatively well vegetated, and here would be included in the category of arid rangeland. Others support major irrigation schemes. However, there remain substantial areas that are too dry to justify major development input. They may be ice-bound or dunefields or, if vegetated, rarely used and unimportant to neighbouring pastoralists. Areas too eroded to justify restoration may also be included in this category. All such land needs to be delineated so that it may be explicitly excluded from the development effort, or at least relegated to a low priority. It could be unwise to ignore such areas altogether unless it has been proven that groundwater or oil or other mineral resources do not occur. Specific inputs may also be required on the fringes of sand deserts, to arrest sand encroachment into more productive areas.

INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects. Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies.
Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

INTRODUCTION
The Republic of Maldives is a coral archipelago consisting of 1190 islands, forming a chain of 820 km at its length and 130 km at its width. These islands are grouped into 26 coral atoll sets in an area of 90,000 sq. km in the Indian Ocean. At least 90 percent of this area consists of seas. The islands are small, few with a land area in excess of one square kilometre. They are low-lying with an average elevation of 1.6 m above mean sea level.
The natural vegetation of an island consists of a variety of plants growing in profusion. The vegetation is relatively uniform and follows a common pattern: salt-tolerant bushes at the island edges then large trees and coconut palms further inland. All islands are dominated by large stands of coconut, with coastal fringe forest consisting of Pemphis acidula, Suriana martitima etc. while the low lying richer soil support isolated strands of numerous species such as Cocos nucifera, Terminalia cattappa, Callophyllum inophyllum, Hibiscus sp. as well as Artocarpus altilis. Although no distinct forests exist in the islands these multi-purpose trees dominating coconut fulfills the needs, such as boat and house building, fuel wood, fencing, foods and medicine etc. Within such vegetation, at least 13 species of mangrove exists in the country which acts as wind breaks and combat tidal surge and provide timber for boat building. Fruits of some varieties are edible and is used
seasonally as a minor constituent of rural diet. Soils are poor and highly porous rainfall is generally variable.

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION
The population is estimated at 245,910 in 1994, which is scattered over 200 inhabited islands. The remainder of the country's islands are uninhabited, with the exception of 64 islands developed as tourist resorts. About 26 percent of the nation's population resides in the capital city, Male. The population has also achieved an ideal growth rate. The annual average rate is 3.4 percent at which the country's population at the turn of the century is expected to be around 300,000.
Despite the fact that Maldives lack land based natural resources it has achieved rapid economic growth during the last decade. Since 1987, the average annual growth rate in the economy has exceeded 9.0 percent, which could be a remarkable performance by international standards. Such performance has being achieved mainly via global markets of fish and tourism services. The growth and developments in these contributed indirectly to other sectors such as agriculture. Agriculture sector grew at an average rate of 3.7 percent per annum during 1994-1996, however, its contribution to GDP declined due to the fact that sectors like tourism construction etc., are growing at a much faster rate (table 1). In addition some agriculture/forestry products, such as coconut/coconut parts, firewood, timbers used for local construction and building etc. are not included in the GDP figures. Hence, it could be argued that the importance of agriculture/forestry to the overall economy could be more
than the estimated value added.

Maldives has never exported any forestry products, however, historically the country has had a good natural cover of forest trees and was self sufficient in forest products. Currently the country is experiencing severe shortages of forest products, mainly as a result of population pressure and unsound land use practices as well as developments in fishing industry and marine transport. Majority of sectoral needs of timber are met from imports' around US $97 million worth of timber products was imported during 1994 (Table 2).
Maldives has felt the need to strengthen forestry and thus the Government has stressed the importance of forest cover and encouraged tree planting on the islands. It is formulating a policy programme to promote conservation and sustainable management of the country's tree resources. A national body is formed to advise the Government on forest rehabilitation and management and is particularly keen to promote planting of species of timber, fuel wood, and improved varieties of fruit trees.
The type of agriculture usually practised is shifting cultivation. Land is cleared by a farmer and often a few years of cropping, it is abandoned and new blocks of land is selected for clearance from area set a side for agriculture. Thus wood lots lands are converted for cropping. Coconut trees are used in agroforestry systems providing shelter and shade go crops and gardens as well as nut crops, timber and other uses.
In the Maldives all lands belong to the State. In the inhabited islands apart from the backyard garden, islanders are given communal field crop land free of charge for the cultivation of annual crops. These lots however, do not remain with the same grower every year; hence little is done to maintain and improve them. The islanders also have access to the community forest lands in inhibited islands and uninhabited islands itself are leased out to individual of agriculture & tourism development. However, uncertainty of land tenure is a major obstacle to the promotion of tree growing. Very recently, a more secure system of leasing land has been adopted i.e. renting of uninhabited islands for a fixed term of not more than 20 years, and this will encourage tree planting and will develop sustainable land use systems through out the country.

LONG TERM OBJECTIVES AND GOALS
Increasing timber production has been stated in the development plans as a priority factor to promote and sustain the limited forestry. Demand for timber (mainly for firewood, boat building and house construction) outstrips supply mostly due to population pressures and improper management. Timber is also recognized as a valuable natural resource in the Maldives and the preservation and regeneration of stocks is an important element of the government policy. In this context, ministry of fisheries and Agriculture (MOFA), the Government body regulating forestry rules, has restricted the issuing of timber cutting permits to protect the existing vegetation. Only one or two varieties are allowed to be cut as firewood Regulations also require that each tree cut down for any purpose must be replaced by two newly planted trees.
Uninhabited islands make up the major part of the land area of the Maldives and the Government felt the need of upgrading the existing land tenure system of these islands. The current system of land tenure does not guarantee a fixed tenure for and island lessee and it act as a major disincentive to development and protection of agroforestry. Therefore revisions to existing land tenure systems have been made for selected islands. Longer term period of leasing with lease based on the resource inventory of the island has been recently adopted.
With the assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization a project was started to stimulate domestic timber production through the establishment of four regional forestry nurseries. The target of this project is to plant 10,000 plants in each of the four major nurseries which will be later planted in the region.
MOFA also have launched a two million tree planting program partly to support timber production and to minimize environment impact from tree degradation as well as to improve the nutritional status of the community Mainly timber, shade and fruit trees are been planted all over the country.

WOOD ENERGY/FUELWOOD STATUS
Due to small size of the islands, forests have been a relatively minor activity. Nevertheless, they are valuable natural resources and play an important role in island community. Most importantly forests role in providing weed energy for domestic purpose was much appreciated. It is the traditional source of energy for daily cooking and preparing bi-products from fish, toddy etc. which provides income to islanders. Today, due to exceptionally high population, overcrowding and lack of space together with increase in fuel wood prices has resulted a shift to kerosene and gas. However, in the outer islands fuel wood is still used extensively. Local supplies has long been exhausted and unexploited uninhabited islands are under risk as overcutting will seriously affect the fragile ecosystem of the islands.

TREE SPECIES IN THE ISLANDS AND THEIR UTILITY VALUE
The native trees used for construction and fuel are common to most of the island. There are also some introduced species (e.g. Casuarina) which are good of utility value. There uses are summarized below:
a) Timber commonly used for boat construction:
Cocos nucifera: Found growing wild in almost all the islands. Used for the main mast and the hull of local boats.
Ficus bangalensis: Aerial roots are used for the transverse mast.
Callophyllum inophyllum: For the curved front part of the keel, for internal beams and rudders.
Pemphis acidula: For internal beams and pegs holding the planks together.
Cordia subcordata: For the curved front part of the hull, in front of the boat, for internal beams, for the rim, rudders and keel.
Thespesia populnea: For the curved part of the hull, in front of the boat, for internal beams and rudders.
Buruguiera cylindrica (Mangrove): For the keel.
Hibiscus tiliaceus (Dhiggaa): The tall straight baled trees used for the rim, keel and cross beams.
Adnenthera pavonina: For all used in boat construction. Now this is rare.
Azadirachta Indica: For all used in boat construction - a rare species.
Mimusops elegni: Used for crossbeams and other purposes. Now this species is rare.
Syzgium cumini: For most uses in boat construction. Now rare.
Sonneratia caseolaris: Used for cross beams Now rare.
Terminalia catappa: For keels and general boat building.
Rhizophora mucronata: Used for keels.
Ochrosia borbonica & Pandanus odorotissimus: Building shelter for boats.
b) Timber used for house building
Artocarpus altilis: Used to make door and window frames and sashes.
Callophyllum inophyllum: Used for doors and windows.
Cordia subcordata: Used for doors and windows.
Cocoso nucifera: For rafters, beams, frames and ceilings.
c) Timber used for handicrafts
Hernandia peltata
Barringtonia asiatica
Pandanus odorotissimus
d) Firewood species
Scaevola taccada: Grows around the beaches.
Hibiscus tiliaceus: Bushy variety often used for fuelwood.
Pemphis acidula: Grows on the beach and is a very hard timber.
Guettarda speciosa: The branch wood and stumps of larger trees are in good demand.
Premna obtusifolia: Firewood and also used as handles for dip bucket of wells.

FUTURE
Lack of space, poor soil conditions etc. will preclude the development of forestry in the future. However the government is keen to rehabilitate and replant plum: species suitable for timber, shade, fuel wood and improved varieties of fruit trees, coconut, bread fruit etc to maintain the existing vegetation.

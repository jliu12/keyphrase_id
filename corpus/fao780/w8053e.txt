Disclaimer
FAO specifications are developed with the basic objective of ensuring, as far as possible, that pesticides complying with them are satisfactory for the purpose for which they are intended. However, the Group on Pesticide Specifications of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Specifications, Registration Requirements, Application Standards and Prior Informed Consent wishes to emphasize that, owing to the complexity of the problems involved, questions such as the suitability of pesticides for the control of a particular pest must be decided at national or provincial level. These specifications should not be assumed to be an endorsement of the use of a particular compound for a given purpose by either the Group of Experts or FAO.
Accordingly, neither the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) nor the members of the Group on Pesticide Specifications of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Specifications, Registration Requirements, Application Standards and Prior Informed Consent warrants that pesticides complying with these specifications are suitable for control of any given pest or for use in any particular area.
Furthermore, the preparation and use of pesticides complying with these specifications are not exempt from any safety regulation or other legal or regulatory provision applicable thereto. Neither FAO nor any member of the FAO Group of Experts shall be liable for any injury, loss, damage or prejudice of any kind that may be suffered as a result of the preparation or use of pesticides complying with these specifications.
Additionally, the Group of Experts wishes to warn users of specifications that improper field mixing and/or application of pesticides can result in either a lowering or complete loss of their efficacy. This holds true even in cases where such pesticides comply with the specifications indicated.
Accordingly, the Group of Experts and/or FAO can accept no responsibility for the consequences of improper field mixing and/or application.

Introduction
From time to time, FAO publishes booklets of specifications for technical materials and related formulations of plant protection products. Revisions of, and additions to, already published specifications will be issued when necessary.
The specifications contained herein have been carefully reviewed and agreed by the Group on Pesticide Specifications of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Specifications, Registration Requirements, Application Standards and Prior Informed Consent after consultations with official government scientists, the pesticides industry through GCPF (Global Crop Protection Federation) and, where appropriate, with individual manufacturers. ^1
1 Should national pesticide specifications developed from these approved FAO specifications deviate from them, the National Authority responsible for making such changes is requested to inform the FAO Plant Protection Service of the nature of, and the reasons for, the modifications.
FAO has published a Manual on the development and use of FAO Specifications for Plant Protection Products, FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper No. 128, Rome 1995 (available in English from the FAO Plant Protection Service).
This manual contains detailed definitions and other essential background information on basic procedures and technical principles adopted by the group on Pesticide Specifications of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Specifications, Registration Requirements, Application Standards and Prior Informed Consent, such as:
1. Categories of Specifications (Section 3.1 of the Manual)
FAO Tentative Specifications (Code 'S/T', formerly 'TS') are those which have been recommended by FAO as preliminary specifications and which are based on minimum requirements. The methods of analysis cited are normally supplied by the manufacturer or may already have been published or be the subject of collaborative work.
FAO Provisional Specifications [Code 'S/P', formerly ('S')] are those for which more evidence of the necessary parameters is available and where some collaborative study of the methods of analysis has been carried out.
FAO (full) Specifications (Code 'S/F', formerly 'S').
Specifications that have all necessary requirements together with CIPAC (full) methods, or other collaboratively studied (proven) methods. ^2, 3
^2 Methods of analysis and miscellaneous techniques referred to in these specifications have been developed and adopted by CIPAC (Collaborative International Pesticides Analytical Council Ltd.). See CIPAC Handbooks 1 (1970), 1A (1980), 1B (1983), 1C (1985), D (1988), E (1993), F (1995), G (1995), CIPAC Proceedings 1980 and 1981, obtainable from Black Bear Press Limited, King's Hedges Road, Cambridge CB4 2PQ, England. The page numbers of specific methods are given in parentheses in the specifications. Copies of methods not yet published can be obtained from the FAO Plant Protection Service.
^3 Information on standard waters for laboratory evaluation of pesticidal formulations will be found in CIPAC Monograph 1, Standard Waters and an FAO Survey on Naturally Occurring Waters (1972), Black Bear Press Limited, King's Hedges Road, Cambridge CB4 2PQ, England.
Wherever possible, standards for apparatus and common names for pesticides are those approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
2. Expression of active ingredient content (Section 4.2.5 of the Manual)
- for solids, liquid technical materials, volatile liquids (of maximum boiling point 50°C) and viscous liquids (with minimum kinematic viscosity of 1 x 10^3 m^2/s at 20°C) the FAO Specification shall be based on expression of the content as g/kg;
- for all other liquids the active ingredient content of the product shall be declared in terms of g/kg or g/l at 20°C. If the customer requires both g/kg and g/l at 20°C, then in case of dispute the analytical results shall be calculated as g/kg.
3. Tolerance on content (Section 4.2.7 of the Manual)
A declared content of active ingredient must be included in all specifications, and one of the problems immediately arising is the level of tolerance acceptable about the nominal figure. The tolerance is influenced by (a) the reproducibility of the method of analysis, (b) the sampling error and (c) the manufacturing variance.
Allowable variations in analytical results (i.e. tolerances in content of active ingredient) with respect to specific pesticide consignments are intended to cover reasonable variations in the contents of active ingredients. For examples of such tolerances, see the table in Section 4.2.7 of the Manual.
4. Containers/packaging
FAO guidelines are in preparation.
Containers shall comply with pertinent national and international transport and safety regulations.
Technical materials, dustable powders and granules
Containers shall be suitable, clean, dry and as specified, and shall not adversely affect, or be affected by, the contents, but shall adequately protect them against external conditions.
Wettable powders
The product shall be packed in suitable, clean, dry containers as specified in the order. The container shall provide all necessary protection against compaction, atmospheric moisture, loss by vaporization and/or contamination to ensure that the product suffers no deterioration under normal transit and storage conditions.
The product shall be protected by an adequate moisture barrier. This may be a suitable bag of polyethylene or alternative means of giving equal or better protection.
Solutions and emulsifiable concentrates
Containers shall be lined, where necessary, with a suitable material, or the interior surfaces shall be treated to prevent corrosion and/or deterioration of the contents.
Additional information should be given in all specifications where particular pesticides present problems in packaging.
5. Biological information
Phytotoxicity
No test can be specified to cover the possible phytotoxicity of a formulation to all crops. When a crop is not mentioned in the instructions for use, purchasers should check with the supplier that the material is suitable, always provided that such a use is not restricted or legally forbidden.
Wetting of crops
The dilute spray should satisfactorily wet the leaves of the specified crops when used in accordance with the instructions. Test method MT 53.2, CIPAC F, p. 162, may be useful.
<section>3</section>
Submission of draft specifications to FAO
Any organization, commercial firm or interested individual is encouraged to submit relevant specifications, or proposals for revision of existing specifications, for pesticide products for consideration and possible adoption by FAO. Correspondence should be addressed to the Pesticides Information Officer, Plant Production and Protection Division, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.
General guidelines on preparing draft specifications are given in Plant Production and Protection Paper 128, Manual on the Development and Use of FAO Specifications for Plant Protection Products, Fourth Edition, FAO, Rome, 1995 (available in English only).
Specifications which are considered suitable for further processing are assigned priorities and circulated to appropriate organizations and specialists for comment. Comments, together with other relevant information, are then reviewed in detail by the Group on Specifications of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Specifications, Registration Requirements, Application Standards and Prior Informed Consent. The drafts are converted into FAO Provisional Specifications, or full FAO Specifications.

NOTES
1. Depending on manufacturing conditions WG may have different forms and particle size ranges. To describe specific products it is recommended to add information about the form (e.g. irregular shape, nearly spherical, cylindrical) and the nominal size range.
2. If the upper limit was exceeded due to excessive desiccation, the material may be acceptable after moisture equilibration under appropriate storage conditions.
3. The method has been developed for water dispersible powder. It was proven suitable for water dispersible granules as well.
4. If additives interfere with the CIPAC method for chloridazon WPs, then the composition of the additives and suitable methods for chloridazon analysis shall be supplied.
5. Chemical assay is the only fully reliable method to measure the mass of active ingredient still in suspension. However, simpler methods such as gravimetric and solvent extraction determination may be used on a routine basis provided that these methods have been shown to give results equal to those of the chemical assay. In case of dispute the chemical method shall be the "Referee method".
6. The product should be tested at the highest and lowest use concentration recommended by the supplier, provided this does not exceed the conditions given in method MT 168.
7. Alternatively, if the buyers require other CIPAC Standard Waters to he used, then this shall be specified when ordering.
8. Unless another temperature is specified.
9. The mass of sample to be used in the test should be specified at the highest rate of use recommended by the supplier.
10. The optical method (MT 171.2) usually shows good correlation to the gravimetric method (MT 171.1) and can therefore be used as an alternative where the equipment is available. Where the correlation is in doubt, it must be checked with the product to be tested. In case of dispute, the gravimetric method shall be used. The dustiness of a chloridazon WG should not be more than 12 mg collected dust with the gravimetric method. This corresponds to a dust value of approximately 10 resulting from the optical method.
11. CIPAC MT 46.1.1 was meant originally for water dispersible powders. It was proven suitable for water dispersible granules, as well. Excessive desiccation can impair the active ingredient content range and the properties of the product. It may he necessary to seal the beaker in metal foil.
12. Analysis of the product before and after storage stability test should be carried out at the same time (i.e. after storage) to reduce analytical error.

NOTES
1. Before sampling to verify the product quality, inspect the commercial container carefully. On standing, suspension concentrates usually develop a concentration gradient from the top to the bottom of the container. This may even result in the appearance of a clear liquid on the top and/or of sediment on the bottom. Therefore, before sampling, homogenize the product according to the instructions given by the manufacturer or, in the absence of such instructions, by gentle shaking of the commercial container (for example by inverting the closed container several times; large containers must be opened and stirred adequately). After this procedure, the container should not contain a sticky layer of non-dispersed product at the bottom. A suitable and simple method of checking for a non-dispersed sticky layer ("cake") is by probing with a glass rod or any similar device adapted to the size and shape of the container. All the physical and chemical tests must be carried out on a
laboratory sample taken after the recommended homogenization procedure.
2. Unless homogenization is carried out carefully, it is possible for the sample to become aerated. This can lead to errors in the determination of the density and in the calculation of the active ingredient content in g/l, if methods other than MT 3.3, CIPAC F, p. 19, are used. If the buyer requires both g/kg and g/l at 20°C then, in case of dispute, the analytical results shall be calculated as g/kg.
3. Instead of using the delicate dilution method MT 3.3.2 for density determination direct measurement using the air comparison pyknometer is mostly preferable. With this alternate method air bubbles will not cause misleading results.
4. This test will normally only be carried out after the heal stability test 5.2.
5. Chemical assay is the only fully reliable method to measure the mass of active ingredient still in suspension. However, simpler methods such as gravimetric and solvent extraction determination may be used on a routine basis provided that these methods have been shown to give results equal to those of the chemical assay. In case of dispute the chemical method shall be the "Referee method".
6. The amount of sample to be used in the test should be specified at the highest rate of use recommended by the supplier.
7. The method has been developed for clear EC and SL formulations. For SCs the volume of visible deposit at the bottom and/or serum at the top of the cone shaped centrifuge tube shall be recorded omitting centrifugation.
8. Analysis of the product before and after storage stability test should be carried out at the same time (i.e. after storage) to reduce analytical error.

NOTES
1. Before sampling to verify product quality, inspect the commercial container carefully. On standing, suspension concentrates usually develop a concentration gradient from the top to the bottom of the container. This may even result in the appearance of a clear liquid on the top and/or of sediment on the bottom. Therefore, before sampling, homogenize the product according to the instructions given by the manufacturer or, in the absence of such instructions, by gentle shaking of the commercial container (for example by inverting the closed container several times). Large containers must be opened and stirred adequately. After tins procedure, the container should not contain a sticky layer of non-dispersed product at the bottom. A suitable and simple method of checking for a non-dispersed sticky layer ("cake") is by probing with a glass rod or similar device adapted to the size and shape of the container. All the physical and chemical tests must be carried out on a
laboratory sample taken after the recommended homogenization procedure.
2. Methods available from the Pesticides Information Officer, FAO Plant Production and Protection Division.
3. Unless homogenization is carried out carefully, it is possible for the sample to MT 3.3 are used.
If the buyer requires both g/kg and g/l at 20°C, then in case of dispute, the analytical results shall be calculated as g/kg.
4. This is to ensure that the user can make use of the maximum amount of the ' product in the container. Suspension concentrates are fairly viscous products. The test determines the ease with which the formulation pours out of the container and how easily it rinses out.
5. Chemical assay is the only fully reliable method of measuring the mass of active ingredient still in suspension. However, simple methods such as gravimetric and solvent extraction determination may be used on a routine basis provided that these methods have been shown to give equal results to those of the chemical assay method. In case of dispute the chemical method shall be the "Referee method".
6. This test detects coarse particles (e.g. caused by crystal growth) or agglomerates (crust formation) or extraneous material which could cause blockage of spray nozzles or filters in the spray tank.
7. Analysis of the product before and after storage should be carried out at the same time (i.e. after storage) to reduce the analytical error.

4.2 Stability of dilution (MT 41, CIPAC F, p. 131)
The product after dilution with CIPAC Standard Water D shall give a clear or opalescent solution at 20°C. After standing for one hour, any visible particles should pass through a 75 m m test sieve.
5. STORAGE STABILITY
5.1 Stability at 0°C (MT 39, CIPAC F, p. 128)
After storage at 0°C ± 1°C for 7 days, the volume of solid and/or liquid which separates shall not be more than 0.3 ml.
5.2 Stability at 54°C (MT 46.1.3, CIPAC F, p. 150)
After storage at 54°C ± 2°C for 14 days, the determined average active ingredient content must not be lower than 95% relative to the determined average content found before storage (Note 4) and the product shall continue to comply with 4.1 and 4.2.
NOTES
1. Some products content opalescent additives for commercial identification.
2. Methods available from the Pesticides Information Officer, FAO Plant Production and Protection Division.
3. If the buyer requires both g/kg and g/l at 20°C then, in the case of dispute, the analytical results shall be calculated as g/kg.
4. Analysis of the product before and after storage stability test should be carried out at the same time (i.e. after storage) to reduce the analytical error.

Introduction
This document comprises three parts:
Executive Summary
Project Profiles
Core Support Project
The Executive Summary is based on that which was included in the main report of the Country Mission Team (CMT). It has been expanded to meet the requirement for this briefer working document for use at the Roundtable III meeting. Where necessary, reference should be made to the main report for further detail on specific points.
The fifteen NFAP Project Profiles cover all five subsectors namely: forestry in land use, fuelwood and energy, forest based industrial development, forest ecosystems and institutions. The emphasis in on watershed management and the total cost is US$ 8.8 million over five years.
The NFAP Core Support Project (CSP) is a balanced plan of action incorporating those components from the fifteen NFAP project proposals which are considered to be of the highest priority, and in support of the general aim of watershed management. This CSP approach, which was devised with the assistance of BDDC, is necessary because the Government of Montserrat recognises that it does not have the capacity to provide the staff and counterpart funds for the full NFAP. The CSP comprises three components:
(i) Strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Environment
(ii) Protection and management of key watersheds and catchments
(iii) Initiation of forestry and agroforestry.

Executive summary
Background
1. Montserrat is a relatively small island located in the Leewards Islands of the East Caribbean, with an area of 10,260 ha. It is volcanic and mountainous with the highest peak at 915 m. With the collapse of the cotton industry in the 1950s, the population of 15,000 fell to 11,000. It has now stabilised at just under 11,000. (See Map 1).
Climate
2. The island is wetter than the other Leeward islands. The average annual rainfall varies from 1016 mm to over 2540 mm on the mountain tops; the amount usually quoted is 1422 mm except for small drier strips in the north and south east where average annual rainfall is less than 1270 mm. However, basic climatic data is sparse.
3. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 caused severe damage but the vegetation is recovering well. Earthquakes of low intensity are frequent, and some have been disastrous. Soufriere cannot be regarded as extinct.
Soils
4. The commonest soils, over 40% of the soil cover, are smectoid clays which are fragile and which cannot be restored when eroded. Sandy soils cover about 30% of the island.
Geology
5. Beach sand has been mined, but finer cinder deposits are largely used. Geothermal energy has been investigated as an alternative fuel.
Vegetation
6. The original forests have largely disappeared. Secondary forest covers more than 50% of the land area, with some estimates as high as 70%. However, there are no recent estimates for moist and dry forests.
7. The vegetation types recognised are:
mangrove forests
littoral forests
semi-evergreen seasonal forest (thorn scrub)
deciduous seasonal forest
lower montane forest
rain forests
montane thickets or elfin woodland.
Forestry and the National Economy
8. The direct contribution of forestry to the national economy is less than 0.5% GDP. Most of the timber requirements are imported. It has been suggested that 235 ha are suitable for protection and production forestry. The Development Plan 1985/6-1988/9 quoted 5734 ha (55.9% total land area) as being suitable for forestry development. There is considerable potential for the forestry sector to contribute much more to national development by establishing commercial plantations (see project 1.03 'Establishment of industrial plantations') to supply quality timber for the furniture trade. Suggestions are made involving nonwood forest products (see project 2.01 for handicraft plantations), wildlife farming and tourism.
9. There are currently no saw mills in operation. 40% of the population use charcoal/firewood as their main source of cooking fuel. There is probably sufficient land to meet the requirement for fuelwood and fence poles, but not for timber. Continued importation of panels, wood manufactured products and paper will be required. 1987 wood based imports amounted to 6.4% of total imports.
10. Between 1973 and 1983, there was a 50% decrease in the number of farmers, compensated for to an extent by an increase of almost 80% in average farm size. Agriculture still contributed 4.5% to GDP in 1985, 16% of exports and 10% total employment. The government gives priority to the agricultural sector despite its apparent decline in importance and there is considerable potential for the expansion of agricultural production.
11. Because there is no substantial forestry or timber producing industry, agroforestry offers good potential in the medium to long-term. Tree species could be chosen to also produce fodder, charcoal and possibly fenceposts. Specific agroforestry systems are suggested.
Forest Policy
12. Various past development policies relevant to the forestry subsector are presented. The goals of the Montserrat Public Sector Investment Programmes 1985/6-1988/9 were to produce as much of the country's food as possible (reducing the import bill), to improve forest capability, and, where possible, to export agricultural products.
13. Forestry has been given a low priority over the years and although plans for forestry activities have been included in national development plans, such plans were generally not implemented due to a lack of funds.
14. Draft policy documents pertaining to development of forests and wildlife, and a revised forestry and wildlife act were prepared in 1987 (Gane & McHenry) and revised in 1989 (Gane, Appendix to main report). Adequate execution of the NFAP will require adoption of the forest policy and enactment of a new revised Forest Ordinance.
15. Linkages must also be made between tourism and forest resources policies, and between watershed management and forest management.
16. There is a pressing need for a land use policy and land zoning has been suggested. Project 1.07 contains a significant element of modelling and demonstration of different effects of development on sustainable land use distribution.
Forestry and Related Legislation
17. This is reviewed and various recommendations made. It is suggested that government intervention in the Forestry Sector be confined to policy declaration and the controlling and regulation of relevant activities. The conduction of commercial operations is more easily available to the private sector at no cost to the public sector.
18. Vigorous enforcement of the ordinance reducing or eliminating the menace of untethered livestock is called for.
19. Recently, a decision has been taken to include national parks under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Division, and legislation to facilitate this is being prepared. The Ministries of Agriculture and Planning will also need to give important consideration to clarification of compensation payments to owners of private lands which are declared forest reserves and the granting of lease/freehold conveyances that will be required to promote the development of agroforestry.
20. Amendments to the draft Forestry and Wildlife Ordinance (Gane and McHenry, 1987) are suggested, and enactment of a modern Water Ordinance.
Forest Administration and Staffing
21. Forestry is administered as a division of the Department of Agriculture, which is within the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and the Environment. The Forestry Division is headed by a Forestry Officer, assisted by 3 Forestry Rangers and other daily rated field workers. Minimum staffing requirements for implementation of NFAP are given, and these take into account a modest initial 5-year phase of NFAP, recognizing the likely financial limitations imposed by government. Proposed project 5.01 Strengthening and upgrading the Forestry Division' is essential to the success of the NFAP.
22. The CSP includes the strengthening of the Forestry Division staff and facilities as one of its three main components. This includes buildings, equipment, nursery facilities, recruitment and training.
23. For the success of the NFAP, training of staff is going to be very important and perhaps best addressed on a regional basis. ECIAF already provides subprofessional training, but regional project 03 'Forestry and related training needs' proposes revised courses to take into account vigorous new thrusts in various areas of NFAPs including forestry, national parks and wildlife.
24. Recommendations for streamlining organisational structure are made.
25. Effective execution of the NFAP will require rebuilding the offices destroyed by Hurricane Hugo. So far, only basic rehabilitation work has been done to one of the two buildings.
Forestry and Land Use
26. Estimates of land under forest cover vary from 35-71% of the total land area. A proper land use map, a vegetation map, a proposed land use map and a forest inventory are essential. Proposed project 1.07 'Natural resources data base for land use planning and management' addresses this need. In addition, project 1.01 has as its immediate objective to survey, demarcate and map all areas identified as forest reserves, protected forests and wildlife reserves.
27. Most of the area in the extreme south, some 500 acres (202 ha), are privately owned.
Land Use
28. Cotton, limes and sugar were near mono-crops in the 1940s. These declined, and from the 1960s, Montserrat had a good reputation for supplying quality root vegetables and for market gardening, especially of tomatoes.
29. By 1983, 80% of almost 810 ha of small holdings were in rough grazing or fallow. Since Hurricane Hugo in 1989, land under cultivation has become very limited. Farming has declined. Relatively massive construction on former estate lands, including for tourist accommodation, has attracted much of the workforce formerly in agriculture.
30. Land use potential is summarised. There is some capacity for the development of national parks with an ecotourist orientation, such as Foxes Bay Bird Sanctuary. The Development Plan 1985/6-1988/9 quoted 5734 ha as suitable for forestry development, 234 ha as suitable for only natural forest, and 797 ha suitable for tree crops. This does not fit well with the protection of water supply. There is an urgent need for land zoning, particularly for agricultural land, and cross-sectoral linkages involving agriculture, forestry and planning will be required.
31. Proposals for zoning all lands on Montserrat have been made (Lang and Gray 1992; Gray et al) and these are now under consideration by the Government.
Watersheds
32. A detailed study of individual watersheds needs to be carried out in order to execute an integrated watershed development plan. Total production from springs only just exceeds demand. Demand is likely to grow but the protection of watersheds is totally inadequate. Proposed project 1.04 'Watershed rehabilitation and management' is absolutely vital and links with projects 3.01 and 2.01, establishment of plantations. Improved watershed management is one of the three main components in the CSP developed for Montserrat and is the basic aim of Montserrat's NFAP.
33. Improvement measures for water protection are described. The development of agroforestry in upper watershed areas which are currently bush or bushed grassland will be very important (see project 1.05). Ghaut and stream protection and stabilisation are essential.
Silviculture
34. 6200 ha are classified as forest with 2819 ha considered as State forest and potential State forest, and 800 ha on steep slopes suitable for reservations. At present, no silvicultural systems are applied to the natural or secondary forests. Selective thinning of some of the larger stands would be justified to enhance the quality of the final crop.
35. There has been no significant planting of timber species on a commercial scale. This is called for in project 1.03. Government policy is to provide hardwood timber for the local furniture industry. Suggested trial species are given.
Forest Management
36. Active forest management has not been practised except for the policing of reserves and some limited trials. Initiation of forestry management is a main component of the CSP. Between 1980 and 1984, an experimental plantation was established at Trant's site. Surviving trees from 1984 show impressive growth rates.
37. Detailed management plans for forest reserves can be prepared only after surveys, their declaration as reserves and inventories. Project 1.02 is for 'Forest inventory' and project 1.01 involves the mapping of reserves. Regional project proposal 02 calls for the ongoing monitoring of forest resources using satellite techniques. Regional planning, training workshops and support for management plan development are also included in this proposal.
38. A sustained yield basis plan including use of the Tropical Shelterwood System is proposed, with enrichment planting on less critical watersheds and more gentle slopes. Establishment of various plantations is proposed (project 3.01 - fuelwood and fodder, project 1.03 - timber and project 2.01 - handicraft species) with initially smaller pilot plots specified in the CSP.
39. A considerable number of seedlings will be required for the greatly expanded forestry and agroforestry programmes. A separate forestry nursery is not recommended but instead, expansion and upgrading of the Department of Agriculture nursery. Project 5.02 directly addresses this need.
Agroforestry
40. Following the former sugar and cotton plantations, agriculture has been dominated by livestock production with grazing predominating, and the production of root crops, vegetables, bananas, peanuts and pineapples. There has been little tree crop production. There is considerable potential for the expansion of agricultural production.
41. There are substantial tracts of underutilised land. Establishment of a land zoning policy is essential to determine the land available for agriculture.
42. Because there is no substantial timber industry, livestock agroforestry could involve tree crops, vegetables or root crops. The tree species would be best chosen to also provide fodder and charcoal, and possibly fence posts. This system would offer great opportunities medium to long term and links with many other areas of the NFAP.
43. The 1982 model farm schemes for farms administered by the LDA are a useful basis but are probably too narrow. Forestry could also be included in tree crop and livestock enterprises (see project 1.06).
44. Specific fruit crops are recommended such as guava and soursop. The intensive fruit trees would be expected to produce EC$ 10,000 per year gross income at peak yield. Intermittently grown fruit trees to be encouraged include breadfruit, golden apples and pomerac. Fast growing fuelwood species and vegetables are also recommended.
45. Regional proposals for marketing made in the St Lucia report are relevant to Montserrat. This would get over the problem for small island states of an inability to penetrate international markets because of insufficient crop production. There is potential for organically grown produce.
Forest Based Industrial Development
46. Practically all the lumber used is imported. There is no local sawmill currently in operation, though there are six small furniture factories. Trees may be obtained locally, selected at random without paying a fee. It is suggested that a royalty is paid even if this is only small. Project 1.03 for the establishment of commercial plantations will contribute towards the country becoming self-sufficient in its timber supplies.
47. There is a high demand for fence posts. Charcoal is an important source of energy. However, there is no management of forests for sustainable production of fuelwood and charcoal, and random clearing results in serious watershed degradation. Project 3.01 'Establishment of fuelwood, fodder and fence post plantations' is therefore very important.
48. A carefully controlled charcoal operation could be mounted using the dead trees resulting from Hurricane Hugo, which have posed a fire hazard. However, at the moment no salvage operation is planned.
49. Up to 50 people are employed in the handicraft industry. However, exports of wood and wood based products are negligible. There is scope for the development of handicraft plantations of, for example, bamboo and rattan, to link with the increased thrust in tourism. Establishment of handicraft plantations is proposed in project 2.01.
Forest Research
50. Virtually no forestry research is being done in Montserrat. The highest priority should be given to documenting the effects of Hurricane Hugo.
51. This would also be an appropriate time to establish a continuous inventory system in all forests, with emphasis on potential production forest types. Project 1.02 is for an inventory; regional project 02 would include an important related training component with forest inventory work.
52. A series of on-farm studies aimed at improving agroforestry techniques is called for and addressed in project 1.06.
53. Specific suggested silvicultural trials involve neem, red cedar, boundary trees, live fence species, pasture grass management, vetiver grass for water movement and erosion control, fruit trees and alternatives to pine for use as Christmas trees.
Wildlife
54. As is typical of such a small island, the vertebrate fauna is limited and would not form the basis for an ecotourism thrust. Establishment of a national faunal reference collection is suggested and described in an appendix to the main report. Project 4.01 proposes a much needed survey of wildlife resources in order to protect and manage these resources.
55. There is no significant hunting or trapping activity, so the principal threat to wildlife is habitat destruction, often by uncontrolled grazing of animals in low-lying areas.
National Parks and Other Protected Areas
56. There are no national parks, only protected areas. The National Trust plays an important role including managing the bird sanctuary at Foxes Bay. Here, surrounding developments could cause pollution of the bird sanctuary pond and a study of this should be initiated.
57. Two reports (Bovey, 1986; Bovey et al, 1986) provide a more than adequate framework for the establishment of a national park. To aid this, Gane (1989) included the need for a subregional forestry services sector, and this has been elucidated in regional project 01 where wildlife and national parks personnel would be available to assist.
Development of Ecotourism
58. There is considerable potential for marketing Montserrat for its hiking and camping pursuits. The lack of major biological species is unlikely to attract the upmarket specialised end of the ecotourist market.
59. The development of a national park will greatly enhance Montserrat's attraction to ecotourists, though there is probably little on which to base a marine component.
60. The acute problem of unsightly dumping and uncontrolled grazing must be addressed. The mining of beaches is also a serious problem.
Conservation of Tropical Forest Ecosystems
61. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 was extremely destructive and its effects on forest production rates will be seen in years to come. The pressing need for a post-Hugo inventory is made elsewhere. No inventory or figures are available to determine the effect of Hugo on animal life. However, deciduous seasonal forests suffered the greatest storm damage whilst the elfin woodland ecosystem is reportedly intact.
62. Enough work has been done for Montserrat to have a nearly complete record of its biodiversity. These lists could form the basis of a forest inventory (project 1.02) or development of a new herbarium to replace that destroyed in the hurricane (project 4.02).
Social Forestry and Public Education
63. Distance learning is an important tool for a small island such as Montserrat. The UWI School of Continuing Studies has an important role to play here and in the region. Project 5.03 is a feasibility study on distance learning.
64. Forestry and related matters go beyond national boundaries and so lend themselves well to regional cooperation. Regional project 05 aims to produce relevant material on environmental matters which could not easily be produced by each individual country on its own, and this would be most useful to Montserrat. It also avoids a lot of unnecessary duplication.
65. The voluntary Environmental Education Committee of the National Trust plays a very important role in public education. In addition, project 5.04 has as its immediate objective the upgrading of the capability of the Extension Division so that more public education material can be prepared. This will be essential for an effective NFAP.

BENEFICIARIES: Forestry workers, general public, forest industries sector
BACKGROUND
The forest of Montserrat are exploited primarily for fuel, posts and poles, an unknown amount of charcoal production and the occasional cutting of a few trees for timber. Practically all timber and wood products are imported. In 1987, EC$3.87 million were spent on the importation of these products and this represented 6% of total imports.
Savings in foreign exchange in addition to the generation of employment will be obtained by the establishment of industrial plantations. Gane (1989) estimated that the annual demand for sawn wood is in the region of 20,000m^3 and about 2,500 ha of land will be required.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To contribute towards making the country self-sufficient in its timber supplies.
(b) To generate employment in the rural areas.
(c) Savings in foreign exchange.

BENEFICIARIES: Forestry workers, general public, forest industries sector
BACKGROUND
Hurricane Hugo in 1989 inflicted severe damage on the watersheds of the country. Trees were not only uprooted but the crowns and branches of many others were broken resulting in their ultimate deaths. In addition to disrupting the functions of the forests in conserving soil and water, the degradation of these watersheds destroyed wildlife habitats including that of the Montserrat Oriole and left dead trees which constitute a serious fire and plant health hazard.
The rehabilitation and management of all degraded watersheds (including the Silver Hill area), are a matter of priority consideration if they are to promote the sustained production of high quality water, foster suitable conditions for agricultural development, prevent soil erosion and flooding, and provide habitats for wildlife.
All dead trees removed will be converted to charcoal with the use of a kiln.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To rehabilitate and manage the degraded watersheds of the country in order to provide the benefits indicated above.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Produce 600,000 seedlings
(b) Rehabilitate 400 ha of watersheds
(c) Manufacture charcoal from dead trees
(d) Purchase of charcoal kiln
(e) Improve wildlife habitats

Project number: 1.05
PRIORITY AREA: Forestry in Land Use
PROJECT TITLE:
Phase 1: Agroforestry Demonstration
Phase 2: Review of priorities (following development of zoning plan) and development of project plans
Phase 3: Projects for problem watersheds
This project is best linked with Project 5:01. Phases 2 and 3 should follow the development of land zoning in relation to a clearer view of the future. The emphasis is entirely on the introduction of agroforestry methods.
DURATION:
Phase 1: 5 years or longer (regional project)
Phase 2: 2 years (in year 3 of phase 1)
Phase 3: 5 years or longer commencing in year 4 of phase 1
LOCATION: Upper watersheds of Montserrat
BENEFICIARIES: Present and future populations
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
1.1 Locate 4 or 5 sites, each of about 5 acres (2 ha) in moderately to steeply sloping land, probably land formerly occupied by vegetables, root crops, tree crops or cotton, or degraded forest in differing ecological zones; Silver Hills, Centre Hills, Soufriere and South Soufriere, preferably also within the area of existing project proposals and acquire, or obtain agreement to use for a period of 5 years (with some option to renew for a rolling 5-year period).
1.2 Demonstrate phased introduction of new cash crops and animal husbandry using the alley cropping system and a variety of crops/animals. Use low levels of intervention of cossie bush areas which might be restored to more productive dry forest and show income achievable.
1.3 Investigate farmer problems of implementing agroforestry and solve.
1.4 Commence solving the water supply and water control problem.
2.1 Land use zoning plan (Project 5:01) completed, also evaluation of previous projects, strategy and policies developed.
2.2 Review of possible combinations of development options (a) with catchments; (b) among parts of catchments and optimization in relation to achievement of policy goals, and any other constraints. Prioritize groups of activities/projects in relation to available funds.
2.3 Final project choices made in relation to capability, need and readiness of target groups.
2.4 Development of detailed project plans.
3.1 Commencement of implementation of projects.
ACTIVITIES
1.1 Analyze the present agro-ecological environments thoroughly and choose 5 sites across the ecological range. These should include as many as is reasonable of the watersheds with existing proposed projects. Determine whether the farmer (if still active) is willing to work the land under instruction (preferred) or will lease it.
1.2 Produce plans for each site which include full conservation and the introduction of leguminous hedges on the contour, with or without drains and vetiver protection, and windbreaks where these appear necessary, for a mixture of crops. Produce plans for other sites to include agroforestry/livestock alternatives. Local farmers and Ministry of Agriculture staff should be included in the planning process. All plans should indicate a "status quo" plot.
1.3 Talk with local farmer groups (using the Farmers' Association as a guide), and development groups or assist informing them, if necessary. Present background and invite comments, suggestions, participation. Also look at possibilities for small processing business development, etc.
1.4 Implement.
1.5 Invite farmers to point out difficulties they may have, and use these problems to elucidate the approach to transferring the methods.
1.6 Keep meticulous records of operations including costs, weather, soil changes, etc., i.e. monitor carefully.
1.7 After each year and at the end of 5 years, evaluate whole experience especially, in comparison with "status quo" plots and make any necessary adjustments.
2.1 Review zoning in relation to watersheds and determine what changes are required and what the particular problems of individual watersheds are.
2.2 Ensure that policy with respect to specific problems e.g. landless livestock is in place, and that a full evaluation of previous projects relevant to the area has been made.
2.3 Evaluate costs and benefits of various alternative levels of treatment and portions of watersheds. Optimize investment in change within sociological, physical constraints Government imposes and with local farmer inputs. Enthusiastic and capable groups should have priority.
2.4 Develop detailed plans for chosen watersheds in first group.
2.5 Obtain funding.
3.1 Implement, monitor and adjust.
3.2 Evaluate experience.
OUTPUTS
1.1 A set of demonstrated agroforestry systems showing how to develop new crops without committing the whole farm, or initiating erosion.
1.2 Detailed data on the costs and benefits of the different systems.
2.1 A prioritized list of watershed projects with estimated benefits and costs of different levels of intervention.
2.2 Watershed data adequate for first approximation decisions on other projects.
3.1 Maximal/optimal return in watershed improvement for a specific level of investment.

PRIORITY AREA: Forestry in Land Use
PROJECT TITLE: Land Development Authority Agroforestry Project
DURATION: Five (5) years
LOCATION: Selected farms at Gages, Lee's and Rileys
BENEFICIARIES: Rural farmers on Land Development Authority Farms
BACKGROUND
Farms operated by the Land Development Authority (LDA) have lost their impetus for production. The project proposes a market led development strategy based on a mix of enterprises capable of generating income sufficient to make agriculture an attractive option. Farm management staff will be provided to develop enterprise options for the farms controlled by the LDA. Selected farms will be used to demonstrate their effectiveness. It is anticipated that the practices will be adopted by other LDA farms as well as farmers on private lands in similar agro-ecological zones to those in the demonstration areas.
The project will also make provision for farmer training to ensure that tenants have adequate preparation. Similar provision will be made for technical training for the Ministry of Agriculture and other support personnel. Provision will also be made to strengthen the market intelligence capability of the Production and Coordination Unit.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To demonstrate the advantages of multi-enterprise agroforestry production systems on LDA farms.
(b) To establish viable agroforestry systems on agricultural land of different quality.
(c) To increase the productivity of the agroforestry sector.
ACTIVITIES
(a) To develop viable agroforestry enterprises
(b) To provide training for farmers and technicians

DURATION: Five (5) years
LOCATION: Hermitage, Galway's, Ottway Settlement, Broderick's, Riley's Estate
BENEFICIARIES: Workers in the handicraft industry, rural communities
BACKGROUND
The handicraft industry is poorly developed and suffers from unreliable sources of raw material supply, quality control and design. It is estimated that approximately 50-60 persons are employed in this industry and they work on an individual basis. Attempts to form a cooperative have failed. Raw materials currently used are Khus Khus grass, vine, rattan and mahogany. Bamboo was used up to the late 1960's but is no longer used.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To improve the handicraft industry so that it can supply quality products for the tourist market and improve the standard of living of the rural communities by providing employment.
OUTPUTS
The establishment of a total of 20 ha of bamboo and rattan and other plantations at an annual establishment rate of four hectares per annum.

PROJECT TITLE: Strengthening and upgrading the Forestry Division
DURATION: Five (5) years
LOCATION: St. George's Hill (Richmond Estate)
BENEFICIARIES: Forestry Division and the general public
BACKGROUND
Until mid-1990, the Forestry Division of the then Ministry of Agriculture, Trade, Lands and Housing had no professional forestry officer. All professional forestry work was done by means of technical assistance. The sub-professional staff employed by the Division were primarily concerned with protecting the forests from the illegal felling of timber, squatting, encroachment of livestock and research activities.
The Forestry Division will have to be strengthened and upgraded if it is to implement the proposed Forestry and Wildlife Act in addition to the National Forestry Action Plan.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE
To transform the Forestry Division into an institution capable of implementing the proposed Forestry and Wildlife Act and the National Forestry Action Programme.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Training and/or retraining of staff at the professional and sub-professional levels.
(b) Construction of a new forestry headquarters at Richmond Estate.
(c) Provision of equipment and support staff.
(d) Recruitment of an experienced professional tropical forester to assist in the implementation of the National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP).
OUTPUTS
(a) New forestry headquarters with support staff and equipment.

PROJECT TITLE: Expansion and upgrading of Central Nursery facilities
DURATION: Five (5) years
LOCATION: Groves Agricultural Station
BENEFICIARIES: Farmers with Agroforestry enterprises and the rural community.
BACKGROUND
There has never been a permanent forest nursery in Montserrat. The requirements of some previous small-scale reforestation projects were met by the establishment of temporary nursery facilities close to the planting site. The nursery facilities required by the Department of Agriculture have always been situated at the Department headquarters at the Groves. However, these facilities received extensive damage as a result of Hurricane Hugo.
Some refurbishment of these facilities is now underway. Recently, a new 47,000 gallon water tank has been installed and a new misting section is about to be installed.
The greatly expanded forestry/agroforestry development programme envisaged under the National Forestry Action Programme (NFAP) will necessitate the production of a considerable number of seedlings of both timber species for:
(i) the commercial timber plantation (20 ha/year);
(ii) the reforestation of watersheds (80 ha/year);
(iii) the soil conservation project (10 ha/year);
(iv) the handicraft plantation (4 ha/year); and
(v) the fuelwood/fence posts/fodder project (40 ha/years); and of fruit tree species for the major thrust in agroforestry at the rate of 20 ha/year or such areas as demanded.
A separate forest nursery is not recommended. A more efficient, cost-effective approach will be to expand and upgrade the existing nursery at the Groves to meet the needs of both the Agricultural Department and the Forestry Division's NFAP development programme which in its first phase will be implemented over five years.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE
To secure planting material of forest trees and fruit crops for use in agroforestry production systems.
ACTIVITIES
To produce seedlings to plant:
- 20 ha/year of timber species
- 80 ha/year of watersheds
- 10 ha/year of soil conservation
- 4 ha/year of handicraft plantation
- 40 ha/year of fuelwood, fence posts, fodder
- 20 ha/year of fruit trees

PROJECT TITLE: Feasibility Study on Distance Education for Improved Natural Resource Management
DURATION: One (1) year
LOCATION: Country-wide
BENEFICIARIES: Caribbean technical personnel working on environmental issues, national educational systems.
BACKGROUND
Many issues affecting the environment go beyond national boundaries. While national personnel are equipped to address general educational issues to improve environmental care and the body of knowledge continues to expand, new problems arise and solutions are constantly being sought. Also, all professionals can benefit from regular "updates" in their fields. Training of newly recruited staff is usually undertaken on a national basis.
Distance teaching facilities are being developed as an efficient means to cover larger audiences at lower costs, diagnosing problems with the assistance of experts at "distance" locations and conducting training. The UWI Distance Teaching Experiment (UWIDITE) has run courses for medical practitioners, public health nurses, accountants, university admission across the Caribbean. Soon this facility will be available in Montserrat. Hence it is timely to conduct a feasibility study on how it can be used to support environmental education.
The implementation of a TFAP is also a golden opportunity for a regional project to pursue training by means of distance education facilities (see regional project 05).
UNECLAV, in its current project on training policies for the wider Caribbean will also be interested in making a contribution.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To conduct a feasibility study on the scope and requirements in terms of physical and human resources as well as costs for an experimental training and education programme on environmental matters through UWIDITE.

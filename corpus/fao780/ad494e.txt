TABLE OF TABLES.
INFORMATION NOTE ON THE FAO PROGRAMME ON FOREST FINANCE It is generally accepted that financial considerations represent one of the most important factors that can have an impact on the implementation of sustainable forest management. With this in mind, the FAO Forestry Department has implemented a programme of work on forest finance, to examine how government policies (in forestry and other sectors) affect financing in the forestry sector and the consequences of such policies for sustainable forest management. One of the most important ways in which governments can have an impact on financing in the forestry sector is through the fiscal policies that they implement within the sector. Where forests are owned or managed by the state, the way in which charges for the use of forest resources are determined and implemented can have a major impact on the scale and types of investment in the sector. A vast literature has developed over the last 30 years examining this topic. Other fiscal policies, such as taxes and subsidies both within and outside the sector, can also have a significant impact on the forestry sector. The purpose of this work will be to review the impact of current fiscal policies on sustainable forest management, along with other related policies, such as land tenure, which have an impact on forest financing. However, the work will attempt to go beyond simple financial analyses of current policies (which have largely been done before) to examine the broader social, institutional and political aspects of policy reform. It is hoped that this work will assist forestry administrations to identify practical ways in which they can revise their fiscal policies, so that they can more easily pursue the goal of sustainable forest management. This work has been funded through the FAO Regular Programme and the EC Tropical Forestry Budget Line (FAO-EC Partnership Project on Sustainable Forest Management in African ACP Countries). A large part of the work has been produced by national consultants and institutions, with the supervision and assistance of FAO. Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted, but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity.

This report describes the forest resource of Liberia and how it is managed. In particular, it describes how the revenue accruing from the sales of the resource is shared. Liberia has a total of 2,085,898 ha of forest land. This is a major source of revenue, contributing between 5-9 percent to the country's GDP. The forest resource is managed by Forestry Development Authority, which is the only government arm given the authority to control the utilisation of the resource and determine charges on forest products and land rentals. Liberia has many charges and regulations for the purpose of forest product utilisation. Some of the charges that are used in Liberia are: severance charge (USD 1.50/m3), reforestation charge (USD 5.00/m3) and conservation charge (USD 4.00/m3). Apart from these charges on timber products, non-timber forest products also attract charges of various levels. Fines also occupy a very important position as a source of revenue to the country. Ironically, even with all the many charges and fines, Liberia collects only USD 7,849,568 in charges against a proposed expenditure of USD 7,918,831, leaving a deficit of USD 69,263. The report recommends that the forest revenue collection system should be improved to introduce more effective and efficient monitoring to earn enough revenue to cover annual expenditure on forestry development in Liberia.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
Liberia is situated on the West Coast of Africa. The population of the country is estimated at 2.5 million people with a growth rate of 3.2 percent per annum. The country's land area covers 37,150 square miles (9,675,000 ha). Of this, National Forests and one National Park occupy 2,085,898 ha. The forestry sector is a major source of revenue. The sector's contribution to GDP and foreign exchange earnings ranged between 4-8 percent and 5-9 percent respectively prior to the inception of the civil crisis. The granting of Forest Products Utilization Agreements (contracts) is based on size classes of holdings (Class A, B and C). The duration of an agreement is 25 years. Timber production in the natural forest is controlled and regulated by a forest management plan, which has two instruments of control (annual cutting of only 4 percent of an allotted concession area and diameter cutting limits on different species). Besides these measures, there are forestry laws, policies, rules and regulations in force to ensure the sustainable management of the forest and associated resources. Only foreign companies carry out timber production and processing in the forestry sector. There are no state owned forest enterprises. Production charges are based on volume and the basic unit for forest timber revenue assessment is the cubic meter. Forest revenue generation is determined by the application of volume-based charges and land rental charges. In addition to these, special charges (referred to as administrative fees) are also levied. There are no land rental charges on privately owned forest lands or charges on processed forest products designated for domestic consumption, but annual permit fees are levied for the production and sale of non-wood forest products. In addition, charges on processed forest products designated for export are very low, with the aim of promoting domestic processing. Furthermore, simple annual permit fees are levied for the hunting of animals and bushmeat sales. The monitoring, assessment of production and generation of primary statistics is the sole responsibility of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA). However, the determination of forest charges is carried out by the Ministry of Finance and the FDA in collaboration with an inter-sectoral committee of ministries and agencies, comprising experts in finance, law, economics, forestry and management. Charges are regularly updated, based on fluctuations in world market prices (FOB) and local production costs. For any new charge structure, a regulation is promulgated, published in the print media and made publicly available prior to enforcement. The procedure for the implementation of the forest revenue system is simple. The rules for assessment, payment and collection are clear. Notwithstanding this, the level of actual collection is not satisfactory. Actual collection accounts for only 30 percent of what should be collected, while arrears constitute the remaining 70 percent (in 1999-2000). In addition, assessed charges are low, on average accounting for only 6 percent of the FOB value of products (in 1998-2000).
The forestry field services and forest revenue collection efforts are weak. They must be strengthened in order for the forest revenue system to have a positive impact on sustainable forest management. This would enable the Government of Liberia (GOL) to realise the full revenue generation potential of the forestry sector. The forest revenue collected is shared only between the Ministry of Finance and the Forestry Development Authority (as spelled out in the Executive Order No. 4, dated 22 June 2000). Liberia is a unitary state, so the collection of forest revenue is centralised and does not involve regional administrations. Furthermore, revenue is not shared directly with other stakeholders. In addition, there are no grants or subsidies for stakeholders operating in the forestry sector. These conditions make the net effect of the forest revenue system unfair and inequitable. The Government of Liberia's present attitude towards the sustainable management of the forest and associated resources is positive. Recent pronouncements and policy documents include the Forestry Law (approved 6 April 2000) and Executive Order No. 4 (22 June 2000), which aim at the strengthening of the financial capacity of the FDA. The GOL also recognises that increased domestic processing and environmental protection are two of the surest ways of sustaining the forest estate. The present Government has constituted a Commission on the Environment. However, forestry research, reforestation and wildlife management programs and projects are yet to be restored to their pre-civil crisis status. There is a need to prioritise these areas of forestry undertakings in the years to come. The current budget of the FDA is estimated at USD 7.9 million and USD 3.3 million is allotted for forestry research, reforestation and wildlife management. This is a positive sign and, therefore, these budget allocations must be obtained for the enhancement and sustainability of the nation's forest resources.
INTRODUCTION.
Description of the country and present forestry situation.
Liberia is situated on the West Coast of Africa and has a population of 2.5 million people with a growth rate of about 3.2 percent per annum (1990 estimates). The total land area of the country is 37,150 square miles (9,675,000 ha). Of this, high forests occupy 4.8 million ha or 49.8 percent of the total land area and National Forests and National Parks cover 2,085,898 ha (see Table 1 to Table 4). In the high forests, the extractable commercial timber volume is estimated to be 3.2 million cubic meters per annum, based on a 25-year felling cycle and an estimated commercial growing stock of 21.7 cubic metres per hectare.

Status of land ownership and tenure.
There is no clearly defined land ownership and tenure in Liberia. However, in practice, in an effort to minimise conflict, forest land is allotted to the following three categories:  Public land. This belongs to the state and includes the National Forests, nature reserves, National Parks and other protected areas.  Private Land. This is land owned by private individuals, business entities and cooperatives. This is obtained by the granting of a public land deed by the GOL.  Communal Land. This is land set aside for the exclusive use of local communities for purposes other than logging. All forest areas (including forests outside the National Forests) are subject to charges, except privately owned forest plantations. The logging companies granted harvesting contracts and operating in the National Forests pay charges to the Government, while those operating on private and community lands pay charges to the owners (provided that they have legal title). The natural forests outside the National Forests are also state owned. These areas are granted to loggers for salvage operations. Part of the National Forests includes 570,334 ha for proposed parks and nature reserves. In the Liberian forestry context, a productive forest is protected by law to prevent encroachment through shifting cultivation, although enforcement has been illusive. In such a forest, the stocking is usually high but is not split into protection and production forest categories. Many of the species that occur in such forests are not harvested because their physical and mechanical properties have not been established (and, hence, they are not traded in international markets). The term unproductive forest means logged-over and degraded forest area with low stocking. Such forest areas are usually granted to loggers for salvage operations for the extraction of commercial species and are later allotted to farmers for agricultural purposes. Artificial forest plantations, National Parks and nature reserves cover 10,158 ha and 701,087 ha respectively (see Table 4 and Table 5). However, most of the figures in Table 1 to Table 5 have certainly changed due to the recent civil crises.
Forestry's contribution to the national economy.
The forest is a potential source of revenue for economic development in Liberia. The sector's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and foreign exchange earnings, prior to the civil crisis, ranged from 4-8 percent and 5-9 percent respectively (Table 6 and Table 7). Table 6.

Description of forest harvesting agreements (contracts).
With respect to forest land granted for the purpose of logging, all investment agreements are negotiated with the relevant agencies, including: the National Investment Commission (NIC); the Forestry Development Authority (FDA); the Ministry of Finance (MOF); and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). An agreement becomes binding when approved by the President of the Republic of Liberia. The forest harvesting agreement is called a Forest Products Utilization Agreement (FPUA) and these are divided into different size classes, each of which has different obligations. These are summarised as follows: (i) Class A Agreement: A Class A Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 2,000,000 acres (800,000 ha) of forest land. The holder of a Class A Agreement is required to develop and install a large-scale integrated wood processing industry comprising of a sawmill, veneer, plywood, or particleboard mill, along with kiln drying facilities, preservation plants and disposable sawdust and waste facilities. Class B Agreement: A Class B Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) up to a maximum of 1,999,000 acres (799,600 ha) of forest land. The holder of a Class B Agreement is required to develop a.
medium-scale wood processing industry, comprising of a sawmill and/or kiln drying and wood treatment facilities. (iii) Class C Agreement: A Class C Agreement holder is entitled to a minimum of 300,000 acres or (120,000 ha) of forestland. Only Liberians are eligible to hold a Class C Forest Products Utilization Agreement. The holder of a Class C Agreement is required to develop a small-scale wood processing industry, comprising of a sawmill and/or kiln drying facilities.
The duration of an Agreement is for a period of twenty-five years (one felling cycle), with an annual felling coupe of four percent of the total area. Agreements are renewable upon expiry. The instrument under which the above arrangement became law is the New National Forestry Law, published on 11 December 2000.
Guidelines for the granting of Forest Products Utilization Agreements.
Any person or company wishing to engage in forestry activities must demonstrate that they have the necessary legal, technical and financial capabilities. In addition, they must comply with the following procedures:.
Submit a written application to the FDA, including the name of the individual or company and mailing address;.
for a Survey Permit, they must submit a Business Registration Certificate, Article of Incorporation, Notary Certificate and pay a Performance Bond;.
to obtain an Agreement, they must submit a work plan, including: a list of the species to be felled; an average monthly production target (m3); a list of the type of equipment to be used; a description of the type of sawmill established or to be established; and a feasibility study on the wood processing plant; and.
to start work in an annual coupe, they must submit the results of a 100 percent stock survey (enumeration) and stock maps indicating felling blocks. In addition to the above, applicants must agree to employ professional foresters (two BSc Degree holders for Classes A and B or one professional forester for Class C). They must also reserve 25 percent of their shares for local Liberian entrepreneurs (15 percent for co-operatives and 10 percent for individual Liberians) and must agree to retain 20 percent of their annual net profits for investment in Liberia.
Guidelines for the exportation of timber and timber products.
The export of timber and timber products (mostly roundwood) accounts for about 64 percent of total annual production. The new National Forestry Law (NFL) empowers the FDA to control and supervise the harvesting and export of timber, timber products and other forest products. In light of this, there are a number of prescribed forms (documents) that must be completed and approved before shipment is allowed. These documents include the following:  Export waybill;  Specification of species;  Sale contracts receipt (SCR);  Sale contracts (SC);  Export permit request (EPR);  FDA clearance, and  Export permit approved by the FDA.
DESCRIPTION OF THE FOREST REVENUE SYSTEM.
Charges on roundwood production.
Foreign companies mainly carry out harvesting and processing activities in the Liberian forestry sector. Currently, there are 27 registered companies and 22 primary sawmills in Liberia (see Annex 1). Charges on roundwood production are based on the volume harvested (in cubic meters) and are levied on all species in all types of land ownership. In addition, there are a number of other charges on roundwood production.
Volume-based charges.
Volume-based charges are levied on the whole length of every tree felled for commercial purpose, irrespective of species, grade and intended use. They comprise the following four types of charge:.
Severance Charge: USD 1.50/m3;.
Reforestation Charge: USD 5.00/m3 - revenue generated from this charge is intended to be used solely for funding reforestation (artificial plantation) projects and programs;.
Conservation Charge: USD 4.00/m3 for Class A species and USD 2.50/m3 for Class B species (see ) - revenue collected is for implementation of conservation activities; and.
Forest Research Charge: USD 1.00/m3 - revenue generated from this charge is for research and development activities. Table 8 Species allocated to each species class for the purpose of charge assessment.

Other charges on roundwood production.
In addition to the volume-based charges, a Land Rental Fee (USD 0.50 per acre per month) is charged in each Agreement area (the granting of non-concession or salvage permits as been abolished). For harvesting in private forests, producers pay all production charges except the Land Rental Fee. This is because such land is not owned by the Government. There are also special levies (called administrative fees) and they are shown in Table.

Note: the Performance Bond is paid prior to operation by the concessionaire is and refundable upon satisfactory performance. The amount of the Performance Bond was set in the Act creating the FDA on 20 December 1976. Marking and grading fees are charged for the inspection and grading of exports and are collected by BIVAC, a subsidiary of a foreign inspection company.
The GOL does not impose road and bridge fees, as logging companies finance the construction of their own logging roads and bridges. These roads and bridges also serve the local communities, by providing rural infrastructure that helps to increase agricultural production and bring about improvements in the livelihood of rural people. However, although it is the responsibility of the GOL to construct and maintain major highways, when the government does not have funds for this, a logging company will often be requested to carry out this work (under a Memorandum of Understanding). When this occurs, the cost of the road works is deducted from the charges that should be paid by the company. Liberia is a unitary state, so there is no regional variation in the forest charges. All forest harvesting rights are covered under the Forest Products Utilization Agreements and charges are the same from publicly and privately owned forest land irrespective of location. However, charges are varied (by species and wood type or quality) for roundwood (i.e. the Conservation Charge) and processed forest products designated for export. For wood traded on the domestic market, wood is graded only for pricing purposes. No charges are levied on processed forest products designated for domestic consumption. This strategy is designed to encourage domestic processing.
Charges for production of non-wood forest products and services.
The production of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) and services is mostly for subsistence. There is no organised establishment (e.g. co-operative) for management and development of NWFPs and information about the sector is scarce. Hence, the contribution of this sector to local incomes, GDP and foreign exchange earnings is unknown. However, the livelihood of the bulk of the population (maybe 70-80 percent) is dependent on these products. Extraction or harvesting of NWFPs occurs in both publicly and privately owned forests and is controlled by regulations promulgated and enforced by the FDA. Currently, charges for the production and sale of NWFPs and services are not based on the amounts extracted and sold, but are levied as annual permit fees (see Table 10). These fees are the same for harvesting in publicly and privately owned forests.

Note: the above fees were introduced in 1998 (Regulation No. 23).
Annual fees are collected for radio masts located in the forest, but there are not any payments for other forest services (e.g. pipelines through the forest, carbon storage, ecotourism development, etc.).
Charges on the production of processed forest products.
There are no charges on the production of processed forest products except corporate income tax, which is levied on the net profit of every company at a rate of four percent.
Charges on forest products trade.
Exports of forest products account for about 60 percent of annual production (see Table 16). Charges are based on the volume of production designated as export production rather than actual trade volumes. The charges levied on roundwood and processed forest products comprise two fees: the Industrialization Incentive Fee and the Forest Products Fee.
Industrialization Incentive Fee.
The Industrialization Incentive Fee (IIF) is levied on the volume of roundwood designated for export and varies according to species. In this context, the designated export volume means the volume that the producer declares they will export. The IIF may or may not be paid before the volume actually goes through the port and the total amount of assessed charges may not be paid in full before shipment. The IIF currently varies from USD 1.44/m3 to USD 58.56/m3, with the rate varying according to the market value of the species (the historical trend in the IIF from 1979 to 1988 is shown in Table 11). This charging strategy is intended to support sustainable forest management and conservation by reducing the incentive to cut only the most valuable species ("creaming" the crop). It also aims to promote the harvesting of less well known species, in order to increase the total production volume per ha (i.e. increase the harvesting intensity in the forest). Furthermore, the imposition of the IIF discourages the export of roundwood altogether. Table 11 Changes to the Industrialization Incentive Fee in 1979 to 1988.

Note that the charges by species were affected by the 10 percent Special Trade Depression Allowance (STDA) and later increases in charges. The IIF set in 1988 is still applied at the time this report was written.
Forest Products Fee.
This charge is levied on processed forest products designated for export. The charge decreases according to degree or level of processing (of the sawnwood, veneer, plywood, etc.). The aim of this charge structure is to promote domestic processing and industrialisation of the forestry sector in Liberia. The historical trend in the Forest Products Fee is shown in Table 12. Table 1 2.

Other requirements for roundwood producers.
The Model Concession Agreement (contract) makes provisions for other requirements, which are not regarded as charges are similar in nature. Every logging company is required to contribute to national development by, for example, building and operating elementary or junior high schools or a clinic in its area of operation. The logging companies also voluntarily contribute to local community development programs and projects. Such contributions help to cement the social interaction of forest operators with rural people and local communities.
Comparison of forest charges to product value.
The logging companies enjoy the bulk of the revenue generated from the forestry sector. A comparison of assessed forest charge revenue (excluding Land Rental Fees) from roundwood exports and the export revenue for companies clearly indicates that the majority of the financial benefits from production accrue to producers (see Table 13). From 1998 to 2000, the assessed revenue accounts for about 5 percent of export revenue, while the remaining 95 percent goes to the logging companies. This situation is even more discouraging when the actual revenue collected is compared with export revenue for the same period (see Table 17), because actual revenue collection is only about 30 percent of the total (on average) and arrears amount to 70 percent. T a b l e 13.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE FOREST REVENUE SYSTEM.
The process of setting forest charges.
The development (determination) of forest charges is not carried out by a single ministry or agency. In stead, consultation and dialogue is used to set forest charges in a process that is open-ended and, to some extent, transparent. The ultimate responsibility for setting forest charges lies with the MOF and FDA, but they are always supported by an inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary committee. In addition to the MOF and FDA, this committee usually consists of experts in finance, law, economics, forestry and management. It also usually involves consultants and the participation of representative(s) of logging companies. For instance, there is currently a Presidential Economic Management and Finance Commission (EMFC). A sub-committee of this Commission was recently established for the forestry sector and asked to examine the restructuring of existing forest charges, based on claims from the logging companies about currently depressed world market prices for logs and processed forest products. The sub-committee recommended a 30 percent reduction in all forest harvesting charges, including the land rental tax but excluding the processed forest product charges (Forest Products Fee). The recommended reduction is currently pending implementation. After it has been decided to change the forest charges, a regulation is produced, published in the print media and made publicly available prior to enforcement. The FDA then enforces the new charges through the appropriate regulations. In Liberia, forest charges are not based on a fixed formula and are not updated each year. However, they should be regularly updated, based on fluctuations in world market prices and domestic production costs (in order to allow a reasonable profit margin for logging companies). The historical trends in all forest charges are shown in Table 15 below: Table 15.

Collection of forest charges and production monitoring.
The MOF and FDA are the only government agencies involved in the collection of forest charges. Production monitoring, calculation of forest charges and the generation of forest production statistics is the sole responsibility of the FDA. Both the FDA and MOF receive payments of forest charges (depending on the type of charge).
Calculation of forest charges.
Forest charges are mainly assessed at mill sites. Scalers work directly with companies to record the volumes of roundwood and processed forest products that have been produced and to grade the products for the calculation of charges. The regional forestry administrators (i.e. district foresters, production forest officers and regional foresters (principal officers)) check the scalers work to ascertain the accuracy of the production volumes recorded on the prescribed forms (see Annex 2 to Annex 5). Furthermore, an inspection team from the Forest Inspectorate Section (located at Headquarters) is frequently sent to the regions to reconcile production records and investigate potential problems. The calculation of forest charges starts with the recording and reconciliation of production volumes. Production volumes are recorded on a number of prescribed forms. The first form is the "Tally Sheet" (TS), which is used to record production in the field (see Annex 2). The Severance Fee Tally Sheet shows the volume of production calculated from the whole tree length (i.e. before cross-cutting). A similar Tally Sheet is used for Exports (the Export Tally Sheet), except that this only records the volume of logs designated for exports (i.e. after crosscutting and grading, etc.). The second form that is used is the Monthly Production Summary Sheet (MPSS). Two versions of this are used. The first (see Annex 3) is detailed and records the number of logs produced per species and severance rate, the number of logs designated for export according to species and IIF rate, the number of logs produced per species and conservation class and the Tally Sheet numbers where the original data is recorded (the Tally Sheets should be attached to this form). The second (see Annex 4) presents the aggregated data, including the total designated export volumes and rates and the total severance volumes and rates. The final form is the Waybill (WB), which must accompany the roundwood on the trucks from the field to the sawmill (Local Log Waybill) or port (Export Log Waybill). An example of a Waybill form is given in Annex 5.
Collection of forest charges.
The FDA assesses all charges and invoices companies for forest charges. At the regional level, the MPSS (summarising the data from the TS) are used to calculate the total amount of forest revenue due from each concessionaire. At the end of each month, all of this information is sent by the regional foresters to the Billing Unit at Headquarters and bills are produced and sent to each concessionaire (see Annex 6). The source documents (e.g. MPSS) are always attached to the bills to enable the companies to check that their bills are correct.
Active companies pay charges by cheque and deposit their charges in designated FDA and MOF accounts at appropriate banks.1 Then they deliver their official receipts to the Deputy Minister of Revenue at the MOF and the Financial Comptroller at the FDA Headquarters. A 15-day period after invoicing is allowed for payment. It should also be noted that a compulsory payment of USD 40,000 is required as an initial payment of forest charges. This must be made before a company starts harvesting. This amount is reduced as production commences and companies are not billed for forest charges until it has been exhausted. Table 16 Year Comparison of roundwood production and export volumes in 1996 to 2000 Production volume (in m3) 28,739 74,976 157,098 353,343 614,155 Export volume (in m3) 24,157 49,463 80,646 189,940 344,206 Proportion of production that is recorded as exports (in percent) 84% 66% 51% 57% 56%.
1996 1997 1998 1999 Tot a l.
Although most payments are made by cheque and a deposit of charges is required (see above), the collection process is not very effective. To some extent there is a problem of inaccurate reporting and recording of production volumes, which leads to charge evasion. For example, the evasion of charges can be seen when roundwood production and export volumes are compared. Table 16 shows that exports accounted for only 56 percent of total roundwood production (on average) from 1996 to 2000. Given the absence of efficient and adequate processing facilities in Liberia, this is simply not possible. At the moment, the capacity of local sawmills is not sufficient to absorb the remaining 44 percent of production, so it can be concluded that some export volumes are not recorded as exports and the correct forest charges are not paid. A solution to this problem would be to improve the salaries, incentives and transport arrangements available to forest scalers and technicians. Currently, a scaler receives an average net monthly salary of only L$ 600 (equivalent to USD 15 per month), which is totally inadequate. There is urgent need to strengthen field services to encourage efficiency, honesty and productivity.
Monitoring and assessment of forest production.
The FDA is responsible for controlling, supervising and monitoring forest operations. The TS, MPSS and WB are used to monitor production and assess charges. In addition to these, there are a number of other important technical control mechanisms that are used to ensure sustainable management of the forest resource. These are included in the forest management plans and include the following:.
Although companies are normally required to pa y their charges by cheque, cash pa yment is sometimes allowed.
Annual coupe: concessionaires may only harvest four percent of their total forest concession area in each year. This requirement is based on an assumption that a 25-year harvesting cycle will allow the standing volume in the remaining forest to recover from harvesting.
Minimum diameter cutting limit per species: this requirement forbids the harvesting of trees below a certain minimum diameter, which varies from species to species (see Annex 7). Again, this is to support the production of the next tree crop, by protecting the trees remaining in the forest after harvesting. Both of these measures are supported by the imposition of fines and penalties if they are violated (see Table 14). The FDA exclusively does the monitoring and assessment of forest production volume. The mechanism for forest charge payment is well designed. Executive Order No. 4 dated June 22, 2000 stipulates arrangement between the MOF and FDA (annex 9). The linkages between administrative processes involved in revenue collection are well documented in the Executive Order No. 4 (annex 8). The generation and assessment of primary statistics of forest production and utilization is the exclusive responsibility of the FDA.
Centralised and decentralised levels of government in revenue administration.
Liberia is a unitary state and county administration is supervised from the capital. All forest charges are paid in Monrovia. The regions offices of the FDA exist primarily to monitor and supervise activities of the logging companies and are not empowered in any way to collect forest charges.
TOTAL REVENUE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION.
Total collection and distribution of forest revenue.
Since the year 2000, the MOF and FDA share the total amount of forest revenue that is collected. This new arrangement was established with Executive Order No. 4 (dated 22 June 2000), shown in Annex.
The revenue collected by the FDA is used to cover the costs of FDA, while the revenue collected by the MOF is used to fund the activities of the central government. The total assessment and collection of forest revenue for the two years 1999 and 2000 is summarised in Table 17. This table clearly shows that the actual level of revenue collection is very poor, accounting for 30 percent of total assessed charges, while arrears in charge payments account for the remaining 70 percent. Table 1 7 Assessment and actual collection of forest revenue in 1999 and 2000.

GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON FORESTRY.
Expenditure by the main government forestry institution.
The main government forestry institution in Liberia is the FDA. The procedures to plan, prepare and approve the annual budget of the FDA are well designed and are explained below.
Budget preparation.
The budget process begins every year with the appointment of a budget committee, headed by a chairman and comprising a representative of each functional division (department). Every divisional manager directs each section or unit head under their supervision to prepare a budget and work-plan. The manger then consolidates the submissions to produce a divisional budget and work plan, which is sent to the budget committee. These are then reviewed and consolidated by the budget committee, which produces a comprehensive draft budget. The draft budget is sent to the Executive Nucleus (Managing Director and Deputies) for review, comments and suggestions. If there are doubts, the budget committee is invited to clarify any potential problems. Following this, the budget is sent back to the budget committee, which produces a final draft and sends this to the Executive Board for review and action. The Executive Board meets the Executive Nucleus (with the budget committee present) at a budget hearing. The budget committee takes into account the views of the Executive Board and produces the final budget for approval by the Executive Board and implementation.
Structure of the budget and revenue sharing arrangements.
The FDA budget comprises two parts: the recurrent (or operational) budget and the conservation (or development) budget. The conservation budget is used to finance reforestation, wildlife and research programs and projects. Prior to Executive Order No. 4, forest charges were collected in two categories by the MOF and FDA as follows:.
The MOF collected stumpage charges (Severance Fee, IIF and Forest Products Fee) and Land Rental Fees. Twenty percent of the revenue collected was transferred to the FDA to cover operational costs (e.g. salaries and other recurrent expenditures) and the other 80 percent was retained by the MOF for use by the central government.
The FDA collected revenue from the Reforestation Fees, Conservation Fees and Forest Research Fees and used 100 percent of this for forest plantation and conservation activities.
The current arrangement for distributing the forest revenue collected by the MOF (since Executive Order No. 4) is shown in Table 19. In addition to this, the FDA must use the Reforestation Fees, Conservation Fees and Forest Research Fees that they collect in the way shown in Table 20. Basically, the majority of these revenues must be used for forest conservation and development programs and projects. One other source of budget revenue for the FDA is the miscellaneous fees and charges on NWFPs (see Table 9 and Table 10), which they collect and retain in full. Table 1 9 Distribution of forest revenue between MOF and FDA MOF share (in percent) 98 98 50 FDA share (in percent) 2 2 50.

The current FDA budget.
The current FDA Budget amounts to USD 7.9 million of which the recurrent budget accounts for USD 4.6 million and the conservation budget amounts to USD 3.3 million. The detailed expenditure estimates are shown in Table 21 and Table 22. Table 21.

Foreign assistance to the FDA is currently very insignificant. Assistance mainly comes in the form of travel tickets and daily subsistence allowances to pay for staff to attend workshops, conferences and short-term training courses abroad. However, a few consultants have been seconded to carry out short-term consultancy work in Liberia (about four people since 1997). The FDA doesn't receive any grants or subsidies from any domestic source, but benefits from some grants through the Society for the Conservation of Nature in Liberia (SCNL) supported by Conservation International (CI) ant the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). These grants are used for the assessment of the status of Sapo National Park, with the aim of producing a comprehensive management plan for the area.
Expenditure by other government forestry institutions.
There are three other government forestry institutions in Liberia.
The Forestry Department and Wood Science Laboratory at the College of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Liberia. The university provides degree level training in forestry. It has been reopened but needs more support to restore it to its condition before the civil crisis. For example, the laboratory is completely damaged and inactive.
The Forestry Training Institute (FTI). The FTI provides training to certificate and diploma level. It is completely damaged and has not been reopened.
The Association of Forest Industries (AFI). The funding received by forest research and training institutions is very minimal, so their expenditure is limited. The funding that they do obtain mostly covers staff salaries and allowances for students. It is estimated that total funding and expenditure does not exceed USD 100,000 per year for these institutions. It is regrettable that the forestry research programmes in Liberia are virtually dormant due to the lack of funds. The country currently suffers from a lack of domestic investment and foreign assistance. The German Forestry Mission (GFM) to Liberia generously funded forestry research and reforestation programs before the civil crisis, but has not returned. The.
management of FDA is keen to re-establish this co-operation with the GFM and others, but has had little success to date.
Grants and subsidies to the forestry sector.
Currently, there are no grants or subsidy schemes available to companies and individuals (including indigenous people) operating in the forestry sector in Liberia. Companies raise their own investment funds, although the Government requires them to retain 20 percent of their profits in Liberia for re-investment in the economy. The Government also requires them to have a local investment partner (see Section 1.4.1). However, the Government does offer some indirect subsidies, such as exemptions from some types of tax. The incentives currently available in the forestry sector are the following:  duty-free privilege on importing equipment for the establishment of wood processing pl ants;  income tax holidays (about 5 yrs.);  exemption of logging equipment from custom duties for a special period (2 yrs);  minimum taxation on processed and manufactured forest products; and  tax exemptions on medical instruments (equipment) and supplies.
Income and expenditure of state forestry enterprises.
The economy of Liberia is based on free enterprise and there are currently no state enterprises operating in the forestry sector.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.
Overall appraisal of the forest revenue system.
In Liberia, the Government is the owner of the forest resource and has the legal authority to enter into contracts with individuals and enterprises regarding the use of this resource. The forest charges collected from the use of the resource are based on production volumes and the land area under agreements. The volume assessment involves four types of forest charge. The area charge (Land Rental Fee) is levied on the total land area allotted to a logging company. In addition, two charges are also levied on the volumes of roundwood and processed products designated for export.
Coverage of the forest revenue system.
Currently, the Government of Liberia is not able to collect the full amount of forest charges that should be paid. For example, some individuals and enterprises acquire forest land under a Forest Products Utilization Agreement, but do not have the capability to commence full-scale operations. Sometimes they only operate for one or two months per year and then suspend or stop operations due to a lack of funds. During this inactive period, the assessed land charges (and other charges) start to accumulate. In many cases, the operators eventually abandon the forest land and the un-paid taxes become un-collectable. This situation also occurs with some of the larger companies, which suddenly declare bankruptcy and depart the country. In addition to the above, the forest revenue system does not capture all of the charges that could be paid. For example, the Government does not assess or collect Land Rental Fees from harvesting activities on private and community land. In such areas, only the volume-based charges are assessed and collected. There are very few charges levied for harvesting and sale of NWFPs, although this is a significant activity in the forest. There are also no forest charges on processed forest products designated for domestic consumption, because these products are exempt from forest charges in order to encourage and promote domestic processing. Because of all of these gaps in the current forest revenue system, the potential contribution of the forestry sector to government revenue is not maximised.
Administration of the forest revenue system.
With respect to the procedures for assessing and collecting forest charges, the current system used in Liberia (e.g. the TS, MPSS and WB forms and procedures) is efficient, but the implementation of the system is weak. The costs of collection are low compared with the amount of revenues collected, but the arrears that have accumulated are very high. Another weakness of the system is that the evasion of charges appears to be quite high. This can be mainly attributed to the unattractive salaries and incentives paid to the field staff that monitor forest operations. Staff under-scale and mis-classify production volumes in favour of companies. For instance, mis-classification is sometimes observed when the Tally Sheets are reconciled with the Monthly Production Summary Sheets. The latter is used to assess the forest charges that an operator should pay and high value species (recorded on the Tally Sheets) are sometimes recorded and assessed as secondary species on the Monthly Production.
Summary Sheets, so that companies would have to pay a lower amount of total charges to the Government. The present forest revenue system is simple. The rules for assessment, payment and collection are clear. In addition, the monitoring of the system is adequately defined through the use of closely inter-related production volume data recording documents. However, as the nature of businessmen dictates, there is always reluctance on the part of logging companies to pay the total amount of charges that are due. Thus, the total collection of revenue is not satisfactory.
Recommended improvements to the forest revenue system.
In view of the above appraisal, the following improvements to the current forest revenue system are suggested for further consideration:.
Competitive bidding for the granting of forest harvesting right must be established. This must only allow logging companies to operate, when they can demonstrate that they have the technical and financial capability to sustain their operations and pay all relevant charges.
A regulation must be produced and enforced, which specifies the penalty(ies) for failure to pay charges after a prescribed payment period (now 15 days after submission of bills).
NWFPs should be taxed to reflect the true revenue generating capacity of the forest. The (current) use of annual harvesting permits for production and sale of NWFPs is not enough.
The existing regulations must be used more vigorously to deter and minimise waste and maximise revenue collection (e.g. the provisions concerning the abandonment of concessions, waybills, declassification, etc.).
A minimal charge on processed forest products designated for local consumption should be levied. This would promote the sale of quality products and not just export rejects on the local market.
Before harvesting, every logging company should be required to pay in advance two years Land Rental Fees in addition to the requirement to pay a USD 40,000 deposit against future forest charges. This would enable the government to derive some revenue even if a company does not operate at all. This would compensate the Government for the time that the land is held idle, because another company could have operated (and paid forest charges) during this time.
The charges must remain simple and practicable, but they should be reviewed when necessary. Furthermore, the FDA should carry out a fuller investigation of requests from companies for adjustments in charges before any adjustment is made.
A forestry sector cost study should be implemented to investigate production costs (e.g. logging, transport, processing and shipping costs). This would help to set forest.
charges in a way that reflects the social, economic and environmental objectives of the government.
Analysis and monitoring of world timber prices must be strengthened. The present system is weak, because the FDA relies on the FOB prices quoted by producers and exporters when they come to examine forest charges.
The impact of the forest revenue system on sustainable forest management.
The forest revenue system is mainly an administrative instrument rather than a technical instrument. The main purpose of the system is to assess and enforce revenue collection. The main contribution of the system to sustainable forest management is through the different levels of forest charges that are levied on designated exports. Charges levied on exported roundwood are higher for the primary species (redwoods) and lower for the secondary species. These differences in charges are designed to discourage operators from only taking the most valuable species and to encourage them to take the lower valued species. In this way, they encourage operators to harvest the maximum sustainable yield, which is one aspect of sustainable forest management. The impact of the forest revenue system on other aspects of sustainable forest management is not easy to assess. In general, the forest revenue system is not optimal because it does not maximise the benefits of forest operations to the country. The technical provisions of forest management plans (the restrictions on annual coupe size, diameter cutting limits and other measures) would probably have more of positive impact on sustainable forest management if they were enforced properly. There is a Performance Bond, which is supposed to ensure sustainable forest management, but in reality it is not very effective. The FDA is the government agency that is responsible for monitoring and supervising the activities of logging companies. Forest laws, rules and regulations are enforced with the aim of ensuring that companies practice sustainable forest management. The companies decide their own markets outlets, negotiate prices and conclude sale contracts without the interference of the FDA. When it comes to the exportation of timber and timber products, the FDA simply monitors and supervises such activities to ensure that the appropriate species and corresponding volumes declared are shipped and there is no mis-classification. Given the strength of international market forces and the speed with which they change, it is doubtful whether the forest revenue system can be used to bring supply and demand into balance effectively in the short-term. Liberia is a unitary state and forest revenue assessment and collection are centralised. This is carried out in the capital of the country and not by counties or local communities. The central government makes annual budgetary allotments to county administrations (15 counties), but there is no sharing of forest revenue with other stakeholders (e.g. private logging companies, forest owners and forest-based indigenous peoples). Because of this, it can be concluded that the forest revenue system is, on the whole, unfair and inequitable.
Recommendations to improve the impact of the forest revenue system on sustainable forest management are as follows:.
An improved relationship with the local population (e.g. indigenous people) should be established and they should be given incentives to manage local forests sustainably.
Indigenous and local people should be consulted at all stages of forest operations.
Indigenous and local people should be given opportunities for participation and gainful employment in forest operations and industries. Such action would encourage them to sustain the productive and protective functions of the forest,.
Deforestation and forest degradation is increased by hunters and farmers who live in the heart of the forest and carry out shifting cultivation (slash and burn farming). They must be persuaded to relocate from the National Forests.
Government expenditure on sustainable forest management.
In recent years, the overall level of government expenditure on sustainable forest management has not been adequate. For instance, prior to Executive Order No. 4, the FDA was only entitled (by law) to receive 20 percent of the revenue from stumpage and land rental fees collected by the MOF. However, in reality, the full amount of this subsidy was never received. It is estimated that, on average, only about 15 percent of the FDA's total entitlement was transferred to the FDA by the MOF (see Table 23). Table 2 3 Year Comparison of FDA budget entitlement and actual budget transfers from the MOF in 1996 to 1999 Amount of subsidy received by the FDA from the MOF (in USD) 131,481 ? 165,000 200,000 Estimated entitlement for the FDA from the MOF (in USD) ? ? 1,056,000 1,490,444 Proportion of entitlement actually received (in percent) ? ? 16 13.
The aspects of sustainable forest management that are currently receiving the highest funding in the FDA are the monitoring and supervision of logging companies. Reforestation (forest plantation development) and forest research currently receive less funding. In order of priority, the following forestry activities must be adequately funded:.
Forestry research and extension services.
Reforestation: a) Community forestry b) Agroforestry.
Human resources development.
Currently, there are two critical problems with financing the FDA. The first is the lack of foreign financial assistance and the second is the difficulty in securing funds locally. Since the end of the civil crisis and the subsequent democratic election in 1997, the international community (including the World Bank and the African Development Bank) has been reluctant to assist the Government of Liberia. On the other hand, foreign logging companies accumulate huge arrears of forest charges. Furthermore, although forest revenue collection is very low, the amounts that are collected are not used exclusively by the FDA, but have to be shared with the central government to fund other priority programs and projects. These problems could be minimised and or eradicated if the international community extended financial assistance and loans to the country. In the case of logging companies' failure to pay their forest charges, stringent measures must be put in place. Reasonable penalties and fines (such as revocation of agreements and transfer of concession rights to others) should be implemented to deter the accumulation of arrears. The Government does not have any scheme under which grants and subsidies are granted to stakeholders in the forestry sector. As these do not exist, it is extremely difficulty to assess what their impacts (positive or negative) might be on sustainable forest management. It is recommended that incentive schemes should be established for Liberian forest operators. This implies that special provisions should be made for forests under the control of local entrepreneurs and social groups, especially indigenous people who live at the fringes of the forest. This is recommended because the revenue earned by these groups will remain in the country, improve their living conditions and thus bring about social and economic development in the country.
The effect of other fiscal policies on sustainable forest management.
The domestic production of food in Liberia is low. This is especially true for rice (the staple food in Liberia). Consumption of this essential commodity is largely met by imports. Therefore, the Government always prioritises agricultural development and provides subsidies for this sector. Upland shifting cultivation (slash and burn) is the traditional farming system used in Liberia and farmers are always reluctant to move to lowland areas and swamps, despite public awareness campaigns and extension services that teach them that the yield from the latter is much higher. Subsidies for rice cultivation are a huge incentive to clear forest land, which is major cause of deforestation in the country. The FDA is the only government institution that always attempts to provide incentives to support sustainable forest management. The FDA encourages agroforestry and tree farming (community forestry), by providing free seedlings and establishing plantations for fuelwood and charcoal production. The objective of this effort is to reduce the rate of deforestation and forest degradation. The subsidies to farmers should continue, but the Government must persuade the farmers to work in the degraded, logged over and lowland areas and not in the heart of the National Forests and other forest areas.
Attitude to change.
The forestry sector now ranks number two in terms of revenue and foreign exchange earnings. In view of the meaningful contribution of this sector to the economy and environmental protection, Government statements have always supported sustainable forest management, in order to maximise the social, economic and environmental contribution of forests to the country. The Government's recent policy statements emphasise the granting of concessions to large, technically and financially efficient logging companies, which are required to establish wood processing plants and promote the domestic production of quality products. In an effort to give true meaning to environmental protection, the Government established a Commission on the Environment (COE). This Commission is empowered to draw-up guidelines and formulate policies to govern the activities of ministries and agencies concerned with land-use. The FDA now has greater financial autonomy and sufficient financial resources, due to Executive Order No.
For example, the FDA budget for the 2000-01 financial year is estimated at USD 7.9 million, with a recurrent budget of USD 4.6 million and a conservation budget of USD 3.3 million. However, the current status of FDA staff is inadequate. There is a need for increased employment of trained and qualified staff, especially field technicians, to ensure that control, supervision and monitoring activities are implemented properly. The attitude to change mentioned above is in the right direction. However, it will be necessary to turn these statements into action if the forest is going to be managed properly for current and future generations. Certainly, the Government's positive attitude to change in the forestry sector is already turning into action. This is reflected in recent policy documents, such as the Forest Policy Review, the new National Forestry Law and Executive Order No.
A National Reconstruction Plan also exists, but this has not yet been implemented due to a lack of funds. The plan includes the forestry sector and environmental protection programs and projects. In addition to the above, the Government has requested technical and financial assistance from a number of international organisations such as ITTO, FAO, CI and WWF. The proposed projects will analyse how the social, economic and environmental performance of the forestry sector can be improved.

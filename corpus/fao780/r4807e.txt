<title>ADCP/REP/85/22 - Nutritional Fish Pathology</title>
<section>1</section>
PREFACE
This report is based on the original lecture texts presented by Dr. A. G. J. Tacon, Fish Feed Technologist, Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP), to the trainees of the fourth senior aquaculturists' training course at the African Regional Aquaculture Centre (part of the UNDP/FAO ADCP Regional Aquaculture Centres) in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, from 5-8 October 1984.
The information contained within this report is a synthesis of published data from a wide variety of sources relating to the morphological signs of dietary nutrient deficiency and toxicity in fish and, as such, constitutes a useful reference source for persons or parties wishing to feed fish with a nutrient balanced diet under intensive farming conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
In contrast to extensive and semi-intensive culture systems where fish obtain all or part of their nutrient needs from naturally available food organisms, fish maintained under intensive culture systems rely totally on the provision of a nutritionally complete diet throughout their culture cycle. For many farmed fish species the development of complete artificial rations (for use within intensive culture conditions) has proceeded despite the lack of information being available on basic nutrient requirements. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that nutritional pathologies resulting from specific nutrient deficiencies or imbalances often occur. This paper will endeavour to highlight the major nutritional pathologies which have been reported in fish fed artificial diets with no access to natural food organisms.

Under practical farming conditions dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from one of four possible routes:
- Poor feed formulation arising from the use of disproportionate amounts of feed proteins with natural specific EAA deficiencies. Table 1 presents the chemical score and limiting EAAs of some selected food proteins available to the fish feed compounder. For the sake of comparison chemical scores have been calculated for individual protein sources with reference to the mean dietary EAA requirements of rainbow trout and common carp (Ogino, 1980). Compared to fish meal, which has a well balanced EAA profile, the majority of protein sources presented have amino acid imbalances which render them unsuitable as a sole source of dietary protein for fish. For example, the deficiency of methionine in plant proteins, yeast, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and hydrolysed feather meal; the deficiency of lysine in oilseeds, hydrolysed feather meal and algae; the deficiency of threonine in some oilseeds and pulses; and the deficiency of tryptophan in fish silage. It is clear that during
feed formulation special care must be given to the choice of feed-stuffs used so that the desired overall dietary EAA profile is obtained.
Dietary imbalances may also arise from the presence of disproportionate levels of specific amino acids; including leucine/isoleucine antagonisms, and to a lesser extent arginine/lysine and cystine/methionine antagonisms. For example, blood meal is a rich source of valine, leucine and histidine, but is a very poor source of methionine and isoleucine. However, in view of the antagonistic effect of excess leucine on isoleucine, animals fed high dietary levels of blood meal suffer from an isoleucine deficiency caused by an excess of dietary leucine (Taylor, Cole and Lewis, 1977). Although similar antagonisms have also been reported for cystine/methionine (use of hydrolysed feather meal; Ichhponani and Lodhi, 1976) and arginine/lysine (Harper, Benevenga and Wohlhueter, 1970) in terrestrial farm animals, they have not been found to occur in fish fed synthetic amino acid diet combinations (Robinson, Wilson and Poe, 1981).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from excessive heat treatment of feed proteins during feed/diet manufacture. For example, under conditions of excessive heat treatment proteins become more resistant to digestion due to peptide bond formation occurring between the side chains of lysine and dicarboxylic acid. The free epsilon amino groups of lysine are particularly susceptible to heat damage, forming addition compounds with non-protein molecules (reducing sugars) present in the foodstuff (Cockerell, Francis and Halliday, 1972). An estimate of the biological value of the feed protein can be made by chemically measuring the free or available lysine content (epsilon amino group availability; Cowey, 1979).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from the chemical treatment of feed proteins with acids (silage production) or alkalies, due to the loss of free tryptophan and lysine/cystine respectively (Kies, 1981).
- Dietary EAA deficiencies may arise from the leaching of free and protein bound amino acids into the water. For example, Grabner, Wieser and Lackner (1981), reported the loss, through leaching, of almost all the free and about one-third of the free plus protein bound amino acids from frozen or freeze-dried zooplankton (Artemia salina and Moina spp.) after a 10 min. water immersion period at 9°C.
2.2 Toxic non-essential amino acids
Although not documented, nutritional pathologies may arise from the ingestion of feed proteins containing toxic amino acids. Feed proteins known to contain toxic amino acids include alkali-treated soybean (toxic amino acid - lysinoalanine), the legume Leucaena leucocephala (toxic amino acid - mimosine) and the faba bean Vicia faba (toxic amino acid - dihydroxyphenylalanine).

Dietary EFA deficiencies generally result from poor feed formulation.
3.2 Dietary EFA toxicity
Under laboratory conditions it has been found that a dietary excess of EFA may exert a negative effect on fish growth and feed efficiency (rainbow trout - Yu and Sinnhuber, 1976; Takeuchi and Watanabe, 1979; coho salmon - Yu and Sinnhuber, 1979).
3.3 Toxic non-essential fatty acids
Cyclopropenoic acid is a toxic fatty acid found in the lipid fraction of cottonseed products. Experimentally, cyclopropenoic acid has been shown to reduce growth rate in rainbow trout and to act as a potent synergist for the carcinogenity of aflatoxins (Lee and Sinnhuber, 1972; Hendricks et al. 1980). Other pathologies observed with trout include extreme liver damage (pale^o in colour) with increased glycogen deposition and decreased protein content, and a decrease in activity of several key enzymes (Roehm et al. 1970; Taylor, Montgomery and Lee, 1973).
3.4 Oxidation of dietary lipids
In the absence of suitable antioxidant protection lipids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, including EFA) are highly prone to auto-oxidation on exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Under these conditions, the nutritional benefit of EFA in fact becomes deleterious to the health of the fish. Feedstuffs rich in PUFA which are particularly susceptible to lipid oxidative damage (oxidative rancidity) include fish oils, fish meal, rice bran and expeller oil seed cakes containing little or no natural antioxidant activity. During the process of lipid auto-oxidation chemical degradation products are formed, including free radicals, peroxides, hydroperoxides, aldehydes and ketones, which in turn react with other dietary ingredients (vitamins, proteins and other lipids) reducing their biological value and availability during digestion. At present oxidative rancidity is believed to be one of the major deteriorative changes which occurs in stored feedstuffs (Cockerell, Francis and
Halliday, 1972; Chow, 1980).
Numerous gross anatomical pathological signs have been reported in fish fed rations containing oxidized fish/plant oils with no antioxidant (vitamin E) protection:

(1966); 5-Hata and Kaneda (1980); 6-Murai and Andrews (1974); 7-Park (1978); 8-Sakaguchi and Hamaguchi (1969); 9-Cowey et al. (1984); 10-Smith (1979); 11-Moccia et al. (1984); 12-Hung, Cho and Slinger (1981)
With the exception of the study of Soliman, Roberts and Jauncey (1983) with Oreochromis niloticus, the pathological effects of oxidized lipids have been shown to be prevented by dietary supplementation with dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E). During the six weeks feeding trial of Soliman, Roberts and Jauncey (1983) the dietary supplementation of vitamin E to an oxidized fish oil diet only prevented the occurrence of lordosis. Although no vitamin E analyses were performed on diet or fish tissue at the end of the experiment, in contrast to previous studies with fast growing tropical fish these authors also reported no pathological deficiency signs in fish fed diets containing fresh lipid with no dietary vitamin E supplementation. Clearly, long term studies are required.
In the absence of suitable antioxidant protection the rate of lipid auto-oxidation in stored feedstuffs has been found to increase in the presence of lipoxidase (present in raw soybeans); haeme compounds (myoglobin/haemoglobin are pro-oxidants present in meat/fish meals); peroxides (product of lipid auto-oxidation); light (UV - formation of singlet oxygen/free radicals); increased temperature (reaction rate); and trace elements (Fe and Cu have been found to accelerate lipid oxidation by direct electron transfer in redox reactions, whereas Zn induces the breakdown of hydro-peroxides to free radicals (ADCP, 1983).

Despite the presence of macro and trace elements in virtually all raw ingredients commonly used for fish feeding (Tacon and De Silva, 1983), and the ability of fish to absorb certain trace elements from the surrounding water, mineral deficiencies may arise under intensive culture conditions through:
- The absence of a specific macro or trace mineral premix within the diet (for details of specific mineral premix formulations see NRC, 1983).
- Reduced mineral bioavailability through dietary imbalances. The availability and utilization of dietary trace elements in fish is dependent upon the dietary source and form of the element ingested, the adequacy of stores within the body, interactions with other mineral elements present in the gastro-intestinal tract and within the body tissues (antagonisms), and finally by element interactions with other dietary ingredients or their metabolites (vitamins, fibre and phytic acid). For example. Table 2 shows the relative availabilities or apparent absorption efficiency of various forms or sources of dietary phosphorus for three fish species.

For certain fish species the availability and absorption of phosphorus and other major elements (calcium) from fish meal and meat and bone meal is further complicated by the absence of an acid-secreting stomach, which is essential for normal bone solubilization. For stomachless fish species soluble monobasic inorganic salts or bioavailable organic salts must therefore be provided in the diet. Conversely, within plant proteins a large proportion of phosphorus is present as organically bound phytates. Not only is phytic acid phosphorus believed to be largely biologically unavailable, but phytic acid also hay the capacity to chelate other trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum) and by so doing may render them biologically unavailable to the fish during digestion (Spinelli, 1980).
Under practical farming conditions mineral deficiency signs often arise from a dietary imbalance of calcium; due to the antagonistic effect of excess dietary calcium on the absorption of phosphorus (Nakamura, 1982) and the trace elements zinc, iron and manganese (Lall, 1979). For example, the bioavailability of zinc, and to a lesser extent manganese, within white fish meal, has been found to be much lower than that contained in brown fish meal (which has a much lower ash and calcium content; Ketola, 1978, Watanabe, Takeuchi and Ogino, 1980). Thus in experimental feeding trials with rainbow trout, chum salmon and common carp fed on diets in which white fish meal was used without a trace element- supplement, overt trace element deficiency signs arise such as depressed growth, short body dwarfism and cataracts (Watanabe, Takeuchi and Ogino, 1980; Satoh et al. 1983, 1983a; Yamamoto et al. 1983).
4.2 Dietary mineral toxicity
A major hazard which may be associated with the use of unconventional dietary feed ingredients is the presence of heavy metal contaminants including the accumulative elements copper, lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, selenium, molybdenum and vanadium. For example, contamination with copper may arise from products fermented within copper lined vessels (brewery by-products), or within pig and poultry excreta from the use of copper based growth stimulants or anti-fungal agents. Other feed ingredients which may contain metal contaminants include: poultry waste - arsenic; paper pulp waste - lead; fish meals -mercury, selenium, arsenic, cadmium and lead; poultry by-product meals - zinc; hydrolysed feather meals - zinc; shellfish - zinc, cadmium; seleniferous accumulating plants of the genera Astragalus and Machaeranthera, or cereals grown in seleniferous soils - selenium; Antartic krill - fluoride.

Under intensive culture conditions, and in the absence of natural food organisms, dietary vitamin deficiencies may arise through:
Feed processing and storage
(i) Riboflavin: used in the form of a spray dried powder or a dry-dilution product, riboflavin is generally stable in dry multivitamin premixes. Processing losses of 26% have been reported for extruded pet foods (NRC, 1983). Feeds containing riboflavin should be protected from intense light/UV (liable to oxidation) and alkaline conditions.
(ii) Pantothenic acid: used in the form of calcium d-pantothenate (92% activity) or calcium dl-pantothenate (46% activity), pantothenic acid is generally stable in dry multivitamin premixes. Processing losses during pelleting or extrusion have been reported to be as high as 10% (Slinger, Razzaque and Cho, 1979).
(iii) Niacin: used in the form of nicotinic acid or niacinamide and added as a dry-dilution product, niacin is generally stable in dry multivitamin premixes. Processing losses of 20% have been reported for extruded pet foods (NRC, 1983). Stability of niacin is good only if the feed is kept cool and dry.
(iv) Thiamine: used in the form of thiamine mononitrate (91.88% activity), thiamine is stable in dry multivitamin premixes that contain no added choline or trace elements. Thiamine is rapidly destroyed under alkaline conditions or in the presence of sulphide. Processing (pelleting/extrusion) and storage (7 months, room temperature) losses have been reported to be 0-10% and 11-12%, respectively (Slinger, Razzaque and Cho, 1979).
(v) Pyridoxine: used in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride in dry-dilution, pyridoxine is stable in dry multivitamin premixes that contain no added trace elements. Prepared feeds that contain pyridoxine need protection from sunlight (UV), heat and moisture. Processing and storage (10 months) losses have been reported to be 7-10% (Slinger, Razzaque and Cho, 1979).
(vi) Biotin: used in the form of d-biotin in dry dilution, biotin is generally stable in dry multivitamin premixes. Processing losses in extruded pet foods have been reported to be 10% (NRC, 1983).
(vii) Folic acid: used in the crystalline form and in dry-dilution folic acid can be lost during the storage of dry multi-vitamin premixes particularly at elevated temperatures (43% activity lost after 3 months at room temperature). Processing and storage losses have been reported to be 3-10% (Slinger, Razzaque and Cho, 1979). Folic acid is liable to oxidation on storage at elevated temperatures and on exposure to sunlight.
(viii) Vitamin B[12]: used in the crystalline form and in dry-dilution, vitamin B[12] stability in multivitamin premixes is dependent on storage temperature; elevated temperatures reduce activity, particularly in presence of mild acid conditions.
(ix) Choline: used as a 70% choline chloride solution or as a dry powder (25-60% activity), choline chloride is stable in multivitamin premixes but can decrease the stability of other vitamins present. Relatively stable on processing and storage (NRC, 1983).
(x) Vitamin C: used as L ascorbic acid, ethylcellulose or fat coated (to improve stability) and generally not added to dry multivitamin premixes because of its poor stability. Readily oxidized in the presence of moisture, trace elements, elevated temperatures, light and oxidation products (rancid oils). Stability is dependent on form of product used and method of processing. Losses of up to 90% have been reported on 'cold' pelleting and drying (original L-ascorbic acid content-400 mg/kg; Hilton, Cho and Slinger (1977). These authors even report a 70% loss in vitamin C activity on the addition of water to the feed mixture, prior to pelleting. Processing and storage losses for practical fish feeds have been reported to be as high as 95% for uncoated vitamin C (Slinger, Razzaque and Cho, 1979). Similarly, G. Reinitz reports that thawing Oregon Moist pellets for 16 h at 2°C or 25°C resulted in 53.7% and 97.2% loss of vitamin C respectively (unpublished data). However, these
difficulties may be obviated by using more stable forms of vitamin C, such as ascorbate 2-sulphate (Halver et al. 1975) or ascorbyl palmitate.
(xi) Vitamin A; used as the acetate, palmitate or propionate ester, usually in beadlet form with Vitamin D3. Vitamin A is stable in dry multivitamin premixes. However, vitamin A is readily oxidized at elevated storage temperatures and in the presence of oxidation products (rancid oils). Processing losses of 20% have been reported for extruded pet foods (NRC, 1983). Similarly, six months storage at room temperature resulted in a 53% loss (NRC, 1983). Stability can be increased by suitable antioxidant protection and spraying on to the outside of the pellet in a lipid medium (NRC, 1983).
(xii) Vitamin D: used as vitamin D[3] - cholecaliferol, and normally added in beadlet form with vitamin A or as a spray dried/drum dried powder. Stability is generally high.
(xiii) Vitamin K: used in the form of a menadione (K[3]) salt, either as menadione sodium bisulphite (50% K[3] activity) or menadione sodium bisulphite complex (33% K3 activity). Stability in multivitamin premixes is good in the absence of trace elements (Frye, 1978). Under processing conditions heat, moisture, alkaline pH and trace elements accelerate the destruction of menadione salts (NRC, 1983). Prepared feeds should be protected from sunlight to obviate further oxidative losses.
(xiv) Vitamin E: used in the form of dl-a tocopherol acetate, either spray dried or absorbed, vitamin E is stable in dry multivitamin premixes stored at below room temperature. Stability is increased when used in the acetate form, but is prone to oxidation on storage at high temperatures and in the presence of oxidation products (rancid oils).
Leaching of water soluble vitamins
In contrast to the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) the water soluble vitamins can readily be lost from the feed through leaching prior to ingestion by the fish. In general, the smaller the feed particle size and the longer the feed remains uneaten in the water, the greater the loss of water soluble nutrients.
L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been found to be particularly prone to loss through leaching. For example, despite the excessive losses of vitamin C which occur during feed preparation and storage (90-95% loss, Slinger, Razzaque and Cho (1979), up to 50-70% of the residual vitamin C activity was found to be lost through leaching after a 10 second immersion period in water (1.18-2.36 mm diam. pellet). In the same study, Slinger, Razzaque and Cho (1979), also reported a 5-20% loss in pantothenic acid, 0-27% loss in folic acid, 0-17% loss in thiamine and a 3-13% loss in pyridoxine activity through leaching, after a 10 second water immersion period. Murai and Andrews (1975) reported a 50% loss in pantothenic acid after a 10 second immersion of a trout pellet originally containing 500 mg/kg pantothenic acid. Similarly, water stability tests with complete diets for penaeid shrimps reported water soluble vitamin losses of 97% (thiamine), 94% (pantothenic acid), 93% (pyridoxine),
90% (vitamin C),86Z (riboflavin), 50% (inositol) and 45% (choline) after a one hour immersion period in sea water (Cuzon, Hew and Cognie, 1982).
Deficiencies due to the presence of dietary anti-vitamin factors
(i) Avidin - heat labile anti-biotin factor present in raw egg white. Readily destroyed by heat treatment.
(ii) Thiaminase - heat labile anti-thiamine factor present in raw fish, shellfish, rice polishings, Indian mustard seed, mung bean (green gram) and linseed (Liener, 1980). Dietary thiamine deficiency may be overcome by heat processing the contaminated raw material so as to deactivate the thiaminase, or by the use of supplemental dibenzoyl-thiamine (DBT) as a thiaminase resistant form of dietary thiamine.
(iii) Anti-vitamin A, E, D and B[12] factors present in raw soybean. May be deactivated by heat treatment (Liener, 1980).
(iv) Anti-pyridoxine factor present in linseed; treatment as above.
Deficiencies due to dietary antibiotic addition
The use of feed antibiotics to treat disease outbreaks may destroy the vitamin synthesising capacity of the gut micro-flora of fish, which in omnivorous/herbivorous fish species is thought to greatly contribute toward the vitamin requirements of the fish (carp, tilapia, channel catfish -vitamin B[12], folic acid and possibly biotin, thiamine and vitamin K).
5.2 Dietary vitamin toxicity
In contrast to the water soluble vitamins, fish accumulate fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E & K) under conditions where dietary intake exceeds metabolic demand. Under certain circumstances accumulation is such that a toxic condition (hypervitaminosis) may be produced. Although such a condition is unlikely to occur under practical farming conditions, hypervitaminosis has been experimentally induced in fish. Toxicity signs which have been reported include:
VITAMIN A
Salmonids
Reduced growth and haematocrit, severe necrosis/erosion of anal, caudal, pelvic and pectoral fins, scoliosis, lordosis, increased mortality, pale yellow fragile livers, reduced body fat (1,2)
VITAMIN D
Salmonids
Reduced growth, lethargy, dark colouration (3)
I. punctatus
Reduced weight gain, poor feed conversion efficiency (4)
VITAMIN E
General
Poor growth, toxic liver reaction, mortality (3)

6. ANTI-NUTRITIONAL FACTORS PRESENT IN PLANT FEEDSTUFFS
The presence of endogenous anti-nutritional factors within plant feedstuffs is believed to be the largest single factor limiting their use within compounded animal and fish feeds at high dietary levels. Figure 1 summarizes the major groups of anti-nutritional factors present in plant foodstuffs with more specific examples given in Table 3. Although these factors vary in their individual toxicity to fish, a large proportion of them can be destroyed or inactivated by heat treatment processes (Tacon and Jackson, 1985).
Unfortunately toxicological studies have not been performed on the majority of these anti-nutritional factors; on a general basis however their presence in untreated foodstuffs normally results in anorexia, reduced growth and poor food conversion efficiency when used at high dietary concentrations (for review see NRC, 1983).
<section>8</section>
7. ADVENTITIOUS TOXIC FACTORS PRESENT IN FOODSTUFFS
Finally, nutritional pathology may arise from the presence of specific adventitious toxic factors or contaminants within certain foodstuffs, including:
a) Intentional additives
- binders and stabilizers (carboxymethyl cellulose, alginates, gums)
- therapeutic drugs (antibiotics, sulphonamides, nitrofurans, arsenilic acid)
- growth promotants (as above, plus anabolic steroids, synthetic androgens)
b) Toxic factors arising from processing
- solvent residues present in solvent extracted oilseeds (methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, trichloroethylene, acetone, iso-propyl alcohol)
- lipids spoiled by oxidation and/or heat (rancidity, oxidation products).
c) Contaminants of biological origin
- protozoan toxins from spoiled fish
- algal toxins from shellfish/fish
- fungal toxins in stored foods (i.e. aflatoxins)
- bacterial toxins from contaminated foodstuffs (i.e. botulinum toxin)
- pathogens (viable bacteria, viruses and fungi)
d) Synthetic contaminants
- pesticide residues (chlorinated hydrocarbons)
- organochlorine compounds (polychlorinated biphenyls)
- petroleum hydrocarbons
- heavy metals
As with plant anti-nutritional factors, dietary toxicological studies have not been performed with the majority of the above mentioned contaminants. For review see NRC (1983); Lovell (1984).

8. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Table 4 summarises the dietary imbalances which have resulted in the manifestation of six major nutritional pathology conditions: scoliosis/lordosis; cataract; fin erosion; fatty liver; exopthalmia and skin/fin haemorrhage. With the possible exception of the studies of Ketola, Poston, Rumsey, Hughes and co-workers at Cortland and Cornell (USA) on the characterisation of dietary salmonid cataracts, there has been no serious attempt to date to individually characterise these conditions in fish. It is hoped that this preliminary review article will stimulate further studies to be conducted under practical farming conditions so as to increase our understanding of dietary related pathology in fish.

<title>Commodity review and outlook 1993-94</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
In the future, 1993-94 will be recalled as the year during which the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations was concluded. The Final Act of the Uruguay Round is a notable achievement which should help boost world trade and incomes over the next decade.
The Final Act represents a milestone in international policy, as it is the first time that agriculture has been included in a major way in such negotiations. However, the result is only a partial liberalization. The cuts in domestic support are relatively small and spread over a number of years. The reduction in tariffs will be somewhat larger and, coupled with tariffication of non-tariff barriers to trade, offer the promise of expanded market access. At the same time the agreed reduction in export subsidies, although also phased and to be maintained at a lower level, should help nonsubsidizing low cost exporters. The overall results should be a modest expansion in agricultural trade earnings, with higher costs to importers for commodities that now are subject to large export subsidies.
These changes could bring benefits to the developing countries as a whole but global welfare cannot be said to improve if the losers, especially when they are the poorest countries, are not compensated for losses. In this connection, the special assistance promised for the least developed and net food importing developing countries to help offset the negative effects of the reform process, including technical and financial assistance to improve their agricultural productivity and infrastructure, will need to be generously supported. The food security situation in many of these countries, particularly in Africa, is something that will require increased attention in the future. In the agriculture sector they cannot expect to make many gains given their reliance on a few tropical products for export, while the costs of their food imports are likely to rise. Although some of these countries can expect to make gains in other sectors, the main solution in agriculture will come
from increases in productivity and production in the commodities essential to their diet, and consequent reductions in imports of such foods. For their export sectors, the best approach would also be to strengthen their ability to take advantage of the new market opportunities by improving their productivity and reducing the other costs, the marketing and distribution costs, that bear so heavily on the competitiveness of their traded goods.
Perhaps more than the quantitative changes to markets and prices, the main implications for agriculture of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations are the changed "rules of the game". The elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade and their replacement with tariffs should improve price signals and possibly stabilize markets but it may pose adjustment difficulties for many countries that have relied in the past on these tools to protect their domestic agriculture from the vagaries of the world market. In the future, too, price distorting domestic policies are to be discouraged while targeted, decoupled forms of support paid for by governments will be more acceptable. However, the least developed countries are exempted from the reduction provisions of the Final Act, and therefore may maintain or embrace measures that capture the subsidies from exporting countries and use them to provide the necessary stimulus to their programmes and strategies for reducing
undernutrition and enhancing food security.
While the international community was putting together the multilateral agreement, many groups of countries were developing regional agreements. The most noteworthy in the past year have been the coming into force on 1 January 1994 of the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Agreement, but agreements have been developed in other regions as well. A feature of these agreements is the growing extent to which agriculture is included. This move parallels that seen in the GATT, where the Uruguay Round was the first to include agriculture seriously. Perhaps this coincidence reflects the general realization that agriculture needs to be well integrated with the rest of the economy even though it has some special features of its own.
While the negotiation of the Uruguay Round and the growth of regional groupings dominated the international agricultural policy debate in the past year, the markets themselves gave us a reminder of their inherent volatility and ability to rise or fall by magnitudes that can easily swamp those arising from the Final Act. After years of decline, especially in real terms, a number of commodities rose in price in the last few months including cocoa, coffee, maize, high quality rice, soybeans and sugar. Expectations of an economic upturn together with the previous rundown of stocks and, in some countries, poor harvests have given a fairly widely based fillip to prices. This was reinforced by the sharp decrease in interest rates which led investors out of money into other financial instruments and, to some extent, commodities. Few will begrudge the rise in prices after years of decline but there are only few signs that commodity prices have shaken off their structural weaknesses
in the last few months. Protectionist forces in agriculture are still extensive, market instability is still considerable, and new concerns such as how to reconcile the needs of the environment with the desire for less fettered trade are on the rise in the international agricultural policy agenda.

General note on statistics
The following conventions are used:
- = none or negligible
... = not available
$ = US dollar
"1988-1990" = the average for three years 1988, 1989 and 1990
"1992/93" = a crop, marketing or fiscal year
Production is given on a calendar-year basis for those crops (e.g. rice, tea and rubber) for which the original data are reported by calendar year. In the case of other crops, a split year (e.g. 1993/94) is used. This refers either to a general harvest period running from the Northern Hemisphere spring or summer of the first year stated through the first part of the second year stated, or to a special crop year for the commodity in question (e.g. August-July for cotton, or July-June for jute, kenaf and allied fibres).
Exports and imports are shown for the calendar year stated unless otherwise specified. Percentage changes and annual rates of change have been calculated from unrounded figures. The metric system is used unless otherwise stated. Data for 1993 and 1992/93 are preliminary estimates or forecasts and are subject to revision.
Grouping of countries
In addition to World totals, most tables include subtotals for regions and other groups of countries used for FAO's analytical studies. The European Community (EC) comprises: Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom. Data for the countries of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic are also aggregated to form an Eastern Europe sub-total within the region of Europe. Other details of the geographical coverage of the economic classes and regions used in this publication are to be found in the FAO Trade Yearbook 1991.
For trade data, totals include total imports or exports of each country irrespective of destination, that is to say, they also include goods imported from, or exported to, countries belonging to the same country group. Consequently, these totals are not to be taken as the net trade of the geographical groups to which they belong.
Differences between figures given for total exports and total imports of any one commodity may be due to several factors, for instance: the timelag between the dispatch of goods from the exporting country and their arrival in the importing country; the use of a different classification of the same product by different countries; or the fact that some countries supply data on general trade while others base data on special trade. In addition, total values of exports and imports differ because exports are generally valued at the point of export (f.o.b.) and imports include insurance and freight to the point of import (c.i.f.).
Figures in statistical tables may not add up because of rounding.

Highlights
o Several important demand and supply factors influenced world commodity markets in 1993. Demand for agricultural commodities was boosted by strong growth in many economies especially in Asia, most notably China, in parts of Latin America and in some of the developed economies notably North America and Australia. Other expansionary factors included the decline in interest rates and expectations of growth in many other economies, while a reduced rate of contraction was expected in countries of the former USSR. On the supply side the year was marked by reduced output of a number of commodities, particularly of maize and soybeans in the wake of flood devastation in the United States. As a result, reductions in end of season stocks were in prospect for commodities such as wheat, coarse grains, rice, sugar, soybeans, cocoa, cotton and natural rubber. Supplies from marine fisheries reached or surpassed their sustainable limit and further restrictions of supplies of some sorts of
timber onto the international market were put in place.
o Prices of some agricultural commodities surged towards the end of 1993 and on into 1994 reflecting reduction in supplies relative to demand. Increases in dollar prices between December 1992 and December 1993 exceeded 20 percent for maize, rice, cocoa beans, oils of soybeans, coconut and groundnuts, some fishery products, logs and sawnwood. The rise in cotton prices too was on the point of exceeding 20 percent, However, over 1993 as a whole, prices averaged below those in 1992 for many commodities including wheat, rice, citrus juice, bananas, cod, salmon, fine wool and wood pulp. Overall, for agricultural, fishery and forestry commodities the UN export price indices for 1993 point to a level 6 percent below the previous year. However, the decline for commodities exported by the developing countries was limited to 3 percent reflecting offsetting price increases in the beverage crops, sugar and oilseeds sectors.
o Manufactured goods and especially crude petroleum were cheaper in dollar terms on the world market in 1993. The 3 to 4 percent decrease in the unit values of these goods meant that in real terms the prices of agricultural, fishery and forestry products declined by approximately 3 percent in 1993 in contrast to the 6 percent decline in nominal prices. Commodities exported by the developing countries maintained the same overall real price levels as in 1992. However, relative to the years 1979 to 1981 the real prices or barter terms of trade of agricultural, fishery and forestry products had fallen globally by 28 percent, and those of exports from the developing countries by 39 percent. The greater decline for exports of the developing countries reflects declines in excess of 30 percent for beverage crops, sugar, oilseeds, natural fibres and natural rubber.
o The global value of trade in agricultural, fishery and forest products in 1992 rose relative to the previous year by 5 percent and slightly more for agricultural exports alone. An increase in the value of exports occurred in cereals, especially wheat, vegetable oils, meat and milk products. Growth was even greater in categories such as chocolate and sugar confectionery, pastry products and pistachios. In contrast, commodities with notably reduced export earning were the beverage crops, pepper, cotton and sisal. Indications for 1993 were for export earnings in dollars to at least maintain the level achieved in 1992.
o The increase in the purchasing power of global exports of agricultural, fishery and forestry products in 1992 was 2 percent and for agricultural products alone, 4 percent relative to the previous year, after taking account of the rise in the unit values of manufactures and crude petroleum. In contrast to the global increase, the developing countries had a decline in the purchasing power of their agricultural exports. Further, compared with 197981, exports of many of these products would have purchased a far smaller amount of manufactures and crude petroleum. The contraction between 1979-81 and 1992 exceeded 60 percent for coffee and jute: commodities with declines of 25 to 60 percent included sugar, cocoa, coarse grains, cotton, sisal and natural rubber. In 1993 the purchasing power of agricultural exports probably rose a little.
o The dollar cost of food imports jumped in 1992. The increase for the developing countries as a whole was 13 percent and for those in the low-income food-deficit group was 14 percent. In 1993 these import bills were probably below the levels reached in 1992.
o The prospects for 1994 were of increased demand and reduced export supplies of some major commodities including rice, coarse grains, wheat, sugar, soybeans and related commodities, cocoa and coffee. Average prices and export earnings were expected to exceed 1993 levels for many of these commodities and for the aggregate of agricultural, fishery and forestry products.
o The year 1993 also saw progress or conclusion of important negotiations which could strongly shape patterns of agricultural trade in the medium-to-longer term. These included the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, embodied in a comprehensive Final Act including the Agreement on Agriculture and progress with regional integration exemplified by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the European Community's Single Market, the European Economic Area (EEA), MERCOSUR and many other regional arrangements in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa.

World economic environment
Economic conditions since 1990 continued to depress demand for agricultural products, and the availability of financial resources for agricultural development, in 1993. Little growth and rising unemployment remained dominant features of many developed countries' economies, while the level of economic activity in countries of Eastern Europe and of the former USSR has continued to decline. In contrast, the developing countries' economics have, in general and with the important exception of Africa, expanded at rates unparalleled since the 1970s. Another positive feature, common to many industrial and developing economics, has been the continuing reduction of inflation rates. Nevertheless, there was hyperinflation in several economics in transition.
World economic activity was expected to have expanded by 2.2 percent in 1993, according to the IMF, as the net result of 1.1 percent growth in the industrial countries, 6.1 percent in the developing countries and a further sharp contraction, estimated at about 10, percent, in the economies in transition.
Continuing weak growth in the industrial countries reflected asset devaluation and related financial adjustments, as well as difficulties in easing monetary policies in the light of exchange rate instability and budgetary deficits in several industrial countries, rising to their highest level since 1982. Weak growth also led to a sharp deterioration in labour market conditions, particularly in Western Europe. The unemployment rate in the EC reached 12 percent in 1993 and was projected to increase further in 1994.
Prospects for a significant recovery in the short and mid-term were uncertain. The IMF forecast GDP growth in 1994 in the industrial countries as a whole of 2.2 percent with 2.6 percent in the United States, 1.6 percent in the EC and 2 percent in Japan. The persistence of slow growth, and the resulting depressing effects on labour markets, may lead to increased protectionist pressure and add to the difficulty of reducing fiscal imbalances.
The overall improvement in the economic situation and prospects for the developing countries mainly reflected the continuation of dynamic economic performances of several countries in central and southeast Asia; the apparent consolidation of recovery in several countries undertaking structural reform in Latin America and the Caribbean; and sustained growth in some countries in the Near East, particularly the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey. China reported 13 percent growth in 1993, although with increasing signs of economic overheating. The recent growth performance of countries in the southern cone of Latin America, and other countries in the region, has also been encouraging. However, these success stories contrasted sharply with the continued depressed situation in many poor countries, particularly in Africa. There the,. adverse climate for exports, poor weather, wars and civil unrest and mounting macroeconomic imbalances in many countries, combined to reduce growth
in 1993 to a meagre 1.5 percent, representing yet another decline in per caput terms.
Expectations for 1994 were for some narrowing of the growth performance gap between developing country regions, Africa's growth rising slightly to 2.6 percent yet still negative in per caput terms, that of Asia decelerating from 8.7 percent in 1993 to 7.1 in 1994 and that of Latin America and the Caribbean remaining broadly unchanged at 3.5 percent in both years.
The countries of Eastern Europe and the former USSR have continued to encounter major obstacles to sustained growth and economic transformation. Nevertheless, economic liberalization in several of these economies including the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, seemed to be lifting the performance of their economies. In contrast, growth and stabilization have remained elusive in the Russian Federation and other countries of the former USSR. The IMF estimated a 2 percent decline in Eastern Europe's GDP in 1993 but, for the first time since 1989, positive growth, of 1.9 percent, was expected in 1994. For the countries of the former USSR, the 14 percent GDP drop in 1993 would moderate to a 2 percent decline in 1994.
Expansion in the volume of world merchandise trade slowed to 3 percent in 1993, down from 5 percent in 1992. The slowdown mainly reflected depressed demand in Europe, with EC imports projected to decline by almost 3 percent. However, exports by the developing countries were expected to expand by 9 percent in volume, about the same rate as the previous year, thanks in particular to strongly increasing trade within the regions of Asia and of Latin America and the Caribbean.
In line with expectations of somewhat stronger economic growth, world trade growth was forecast to accelerate to 5 percent in 1994. The developing countries would again be the main driving force. Exports by the developing countries were forecast to increase by 9 percent, against only 3 percent for the industrial countries.
Debts of developing countries increased
The total external debt stock of all developing countries was projected to reach $1 770 billion at the end of 1993, up 7 percent from the previous year. The projected increase in debt stock was due to: a substantial increase in positive net flows to almost $90 billion in 1993; capitalization of interest through debt rescheduling contributing $15 billion; and the effect of changes in the value of the dollar adding another $23 billion. Deductions from the debt stock totalled $19 billion in 1993 comprising: part forgiveness of debt and voluntary debt reduction of $9 billion; and decreases in interest arrears of $10 billion. However, for the severely indebted low income countries debt forgiveness, mainly by official bilateral creditors, has been largely offset by capitalization of interest and accumulated interest arrears. At the regional level, East Asia and the Pacific showed the largest growth of external debt liabilities, mainly as the result of easy access to capital
markets by many countries of the region. The debt-to-export ratio of developing countries was projected to increase to 180 percent in 1993 while for sub Saharan Africa, it was projected to remain at the previous year's high level of 237 percent.
Aggregate net long-term resource flows to developing countries more than doubled since 1990 to a projected $177 billion in 1993. This reflected their improved access to international capital markets and for some regions, especially Latin America, an increase in net flows from a reversal of capital flight.
In 1993, the flow from private sources rose 11 percent to over $113 billion, the highest in the decade. In addition, official flows comprising loans and grants of $63 billion were projected for 1993. The expansion of private capital flows was driven by a strong surge in foreign direct investment which exceeded official flows for the second consecutive year. The main recipients of private resource flows have been middle-income countries undergoing vigorous and market-oriented economic policy reforms and the countries that have avoided an overhang of commercial bank debt. Most low-income countries have not benefited from rapidly rising private capital flows, except China, which was the largest single recipient of foreign direct investment among the developing countries. Total debt service payments of all developing countries increased 2 percent to $183 billion in 1993. The ratio of debt service to export earnings remained at 19 percent, unchanged since 1990. For sub-Saharan
Africa, it would decline from 17 percent to 13 percent.
Food and agricultural production declined slightly in 1993
Preliminary estimates indicated a slight decline in global crop and livestock production in 1993. The decline was mainly attributable to a contraction in the developed countries of 3 percent, with virtually all developed country regions experiencing production decreases. The largest decline was in North America, a fall of 6 percent as adverse weather conditions in the United States hit grain and soya bean production in particular. A 6 percent drop was also estimated for Oceania. Agricultural production continued to decline in the countries of the former USSR, although the estimated 2 percent contraction was less than that of the previous two years. This production shortfall mainly reflected a further decline in livestock production which more than offset a slight recovery in crop production. In Europe, agricultural production in 1993 contracted by 1.4 percent. The decline in the EC of 2.2 percent resulted from reduced plantings due to set-aside of land and adverse weather
conditions in large producing areas.
For developing countries as a whole, preliminary estimates pointed to an expansion of agricultural production in 1993 of just one percent, well below the population growth rate. Africa was estimated to have expanded production by 3 percent, the highest regional increase in 1993. This would mainly be the result of a recovery in southern Africa from the drought-stricken harvests of 1992, but also of a 4 percent expansion in Nigeria. The estimated overall increase in Africa in 1993 should be seen against the 3 percent decline in the previous year.
Among the other developing country regions, probably only the Far East increased output in 1993, albeit by only one percent, with production declining slightly in China and increasing moderately in India. In Latin America and the Caribbean indications were of a one percent decline. There, a 3 percent increase in livestock production did not fully offset crop shortfalls in such major producing countries as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. In the Near East, preliminary data pointed to a slight decrease in agricultural production following a 6 percent increase in the previous year.

Price decline reversed towards the end of 1993
It was only in the fourth quarter of 1993 that prices of agricultural, fishery and forestry commodities generally rose above those of the previous year. For the year as a whole the average level of prices, in dollars, was 6 percent below that of 1992, as indicated by UN indices of export prices (Table 2). However, the decrease was larger for the main exports of the developed countries, such as wheat, maize and livestock products, amounting to an 8 percent overall decrease. In contrast, the decrease for the developing countries was 3 percent as these countries benefited from increases in some of their main exports, notably for coffee, cocoa and soybean oil. For coffee and cocoa the reversal of the decline that had halved prices since 1979-81 reflected reduction in exportable supplies because of reduced output and producers' moves to control quantities entering international trade.
In the last quarter of 1993 sharply increased prices were paid for commodities affected by reductions in harvests and anticipated increases in demand for imports. Flood devastation in the United States reduced the output and quality of soybeans and maize in particular. Soybean prices in the United States jumped 16 percent from June to July, maize jumped 9 percent between these months. Thereafter these prices continued to increase as did prices of related commodities such as other oilseeds and vegetable oils. Output of rice in Japan fell sharply and the prospective volume of sales drove the market up. The FAO export price index for high quality rice finished the year 55 percent above its level at mid year, though the price of lower qualities in abundant supply rose less. Sugar's international reference price went up to finish the year 40 percent above its level at the end of 1992. The increase reflected a further depletion of stocks and continued growth in demand.
The barter terms of trade between on the one hand the agricultural, fishery and forestry commodities, and on the other manufactured goods and crude petroleum declined by a further 3 percent in 1993. The decline in the nominal price, of 6 percent, was partly offset 100 by a 3-4 percent decline in unit values of manufactured goods and crude petroleum in international trade, also expressed in dollars. For the developing countries there was no overall decline in the real price of their agricultural exports for the first time since 1988. However, the years of decline had, by 1993, brought their price to a level 39 percent below that in the years 1979-81. For the developed countries the comparable decline in real prices was 23 percent.

Export earnings growth in 1992
The 5 percent increase in the dollar value of exports of agricultural, fishery and forestry products in 1992 (Table 3) largely reflected the 7 percent rise in the agricultural component. Deflating these values by the 3 percent overall rise in unit values of manufactures and crude petroleum, shows a 2 percent increase in the purchasing power of global exports between 1991 and 1992. The real value of exports of the developed countries rose 4 percent, contrasting with the 2 percent decrease in the purchasing power of exports from the developing countries. Their forest product exports declined in purchasing power as did some agricultural products including: coffee, by 22 percent; tea, by 16 percent; cotton by 15 percent, though these were largely offset by increases for cereals, of 25 percent; vegetable oils and oilcakes, of 6 percent; sugar, of 7 percent and continued growth in diverse exports such as chocolate and sugar confectionery.
The growth in agricultural export earnings owed much to the rise in the volume of exports of 5 percent, the overall index of export unit values rising by only 2 percent (Table 4). However, for the developing countries the continued and relatively strong growth in volume, 7 percent up, was accompanied by a decrease in unit values of 5 percent. For them, the index of unit values fell to 80 percent of its level in 1979-81 and was lower than in any previous year. In real terms the decline from 1979-81 to 1992 was 37 percent. In contrast, the index of export unit values for the developed countries continued to move upwards to a record 131 and in real terms it was slightly higher than in 1979-81.

Contraction in Africa's exports
In contrast to growth in agricultural, fishery and forestry exports in the developing countries as a whole in 1992, Africa's exports fell 8 percent to $11 000 million (Table 6), with a similar fall in the agricultural component to $8 300 million. The decline in Africa's agricultural exports partly reflected decreased earnings from coffee, cocoa, cotton, tobacco and the effects of the widespread drought. Comparison with the years 1979-81 and removing the effects of inflation, shows a decline in the region's export purchasing power of 30 percent.
Import growth highest in Africa in 1992
Imports of agricultural, fishery and forestry products expanded in all regions in 1992 (Table 7). The largest expansion was in Africa where food imports in particular increased by 26 percent to $10 000 million following the effects of drought on crop production in the region. It was also of concern that in 1992 Africa turned from being a region with reasonably balanced trade in agricultural, fishery and forestry products to a position of substantial net deficit. Both Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean maintained their net export position in these products while the Near East continued to be the main net importing developing region.
Real growth in export earnings likely in 1993 and 1994
Indications of export performance in 1993 were for overall growth in the purchasing power of agricultural, fishery and forestry exports. Important contributions to this growth were expected to have come from the beverage crops, oilseeds and vegetable oils, and from further growth in exports of diverse products covered by the 'other agricultural exports' row at the bottom of Table 5. This growth was likely to maintain the dollar value of agricultural exports while the decline in unit values of manufactures and crude petroleum should have enhanced the purchasing power of these exports. In contrast, indications for forest products were for a decline in the dollar value of exports reflecting, in particular, lower prices for wood pulp. Further overall growth in the purchasing power of agricultural, fishery and forestry products was expected for 1994 with some improvement in the terms of trade of these exports.

Diversification, the source of growth in earnings from agricultural exports
Diversification away from selected main commodities shown in Table 5 has been the main cause for the growth in the value of exports of agricultural products in the past decade. Thus, while overall agricultural exports grew in real terms by 2 percent annually from 1979-81 to 1992, the category "other agricultural exports" in Table 5, and reproduced in the adjoining table, grew by 5 percent a year and accounted for all of the growth in the total. These "other agricultural exports" comprise: (1) those directly linked to commodities specified in Table 5, such as chocolate products; and (2) others not itemized in Table 5, such as roots and tubers, pulses and nuts and processed forms of these. The stronger growth was in group (1) especially in confectionery and in the cereal products, particularly pastry products, breakfast cereals and infant foods.

Among the commodities in group (2), those not listed in Table 5, major contributions to growth came from: fruits and vegetables especially tomatoes, mushrooms, chilies and green peppers; pet food, corn gluten and food wastes used as feed; and cut flowers, the major item in the crude animal and vegetable materials category shown in the adjoining table.
The proportion of agricultural exports accounted for by the selected main commodities shown in Table 5 declined from 73 percent in the years 1979-81 to 58 percent in 1992. However, these statistics overstate the decline in the contribution of these selected commodities. Aggregating exports of these selected commodities with those of products derived from them, group (1) in the adjoining table, shows an increase in their value from $179 000 million to $250 000 million over the period. The share of this aggregate in total agricultural exports only fell from 80 percent in 1979-81 to 71 percent in 1992. Thus, these selected commodities have continued to make a major contribution to agricultural exports, but the form of export has changed from raw to more value-added processed products. Further, this process of vertical diversification is understated in these data as: (i) Within the categories listed in Table 5 there has also been a shift from raw to more processed products.
Exports of raw sugar, for example, declined greatly over the period, partly offset by expansion of refined sugar exports. Similarly, the value of oilseed exports hardly increased in contrast to the rise in that of vegetable oils, oilseed cakes and meals. (ii) The processing of some agricultural commodities transformed them into products not categorized as agricultural, such as cotton into textiles, jute into jute products and hides into leather and shoes, and hence their exclusion from these tables. Thus, the commodities listed in Table 5 have in fact been the source of raw material for considerable growth in export earnings over the period from 1979-81 to 1992; the development being from export in raw form to export in more processed and more value-added forms.
It is also noteworthy that commodities not mentioned in Table 5 have grown greatly in importance, rising from 20 to 29 percent of agricultural exports over the period from 1979-81 to 1992. This process of horizontal diversification, by increasing the spread of products exported, has enabled some countries to move away from being overdependent on a few products. Some major new exports have emerged such as: pistachio nuts, where exports have increased from $56 million to $500 million over the period; mangoes up from $28 million to $206 million; and kiwi fruit up from $32 million to $610 million. In addition, it is estimated that exports of cut flowers exceeded $14 000 million in 1992, more than double the figure in the years 1979-81.
Commodity markets in summary
Beverages, sugar, bananas and pepper
Production of coffee was expected to rise by 6 percent in 1993/94. This mainly reflected increased production in Brazil with favourable weather and new trees entering production. Crop reductions were expected in many other countries. These stemmed from many factors but, mainly, from the past several years of very depressed prices and their effect on husbandry, disease prevention and tree replacement. However, the decline in prices had spurred consumption, which otherwise might have languished with the economic recession in many of the large markets. Price reductions led to a further large decline in export earnings in 1992, of 13 percent. However, in 1993 prices recovered somewhat and in the short run were expected to rise as the operation of a new exporters' retention scheme and smaller crops would partly counteract the failure to negotiate a new ICA with economic clauses.
Cocoa consumption in 1993/94 was forecast to exceed production for the third successive year. With consumption continuing to increase slowly and output thought unlikely to recover in the short term there are prospects for continuing deficits. Stocks fell considerably from their previously high levels and this, together with the likelihood of future deficits has lifted prices. Prices should also be sustained by the operation of a new Cocoa Agreement though doubts remain about its effective scope. Export earnings by developing countries declined again in 1993, by 3 percent, and they will continue to be restricted by slackness in the trade in cocoa products.
In 1993, global tea production was expected to have recovered considerably with larger crops in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and elsewhere in East Africa. The volume of trade was also expected to rise reflecting increased import demand especially from the countries of the former USSR and the United Kingdom. Tea prices in most markets, expressed in US dollars, rose from the levels of 1992. Some further lift in prices was expected in 1994.
World production of sugar was forecast to rise 1.4 percent in 1993/94, recovering from a 3 percent fall in the previous year. Despite the expected increase, production would still be short of global consumption, which was forecast to rise by 1.5 percent in 1994. Thus for a second year in a row, carryover stocks would be reduced by the end of 1993/94. Total exportable supplies, however, should be adequate as import demand was likely to decline. Export earnings from sugar totalled $10 600 million in 1992 and were not likely to show much expansion in 1993 as lower volume would offset the effect of somewhat higher prices.
In 1992, the global volume of banana exports declined by 1.5 percent, the first decline for ten years. Countries with the largest reductions were Ecuador and the Philippines and these were not offset by some increases by members of the UPEB group of countries. From 1 July 1993 the EC removed trade barriers between the banana markets of its members creating a single EC market. Since then prices have increased considerably in those EC markets that formerly had duty free imports.
Hurricane damage during 1993 resulted in some loss of banana production in Colombia and Honduras, which, however, is unlikely to reduce markedly the excess of export supply capacity over imports. Some further eradication of plantations in Ecuador was likely to remove areas of marginal production amounting to 20 percent of the total but with a lesser impact on output. A continuation of excess supply and depressed prices outside the EC was thus likely.
World pepper production declined in 1992, after two consecutive years of record harvests. The decline was mainly the result of a sharp drop in Brazil's output. World trade in pepper also contracted, and export earnings continued to fall due to both reduced export volumes and prices. The 1993 global pepper harvest was forecast to drop even further, as most major producing countries expected substantially lower output. Prices rose during 1993 as a result of smaller crops and some disruption in the flow of supplies to the market. White pepper prices rose far more than those for black pepper. A further sizeable increase in prices was considered to be unlikely in the short term as pepper production in Indonesia was expected to recover in 1994 and this would offset the expected reductions in output from most other major producers.
Cereals
For the world rice market 1993 was a year of uncertainty. Relatively large supplies early in the year led exporters to adopt competitive export measures to retain market shares. The United States increased its allocation of rice under its Export Enhancement Programme and its export prices fell sharply. Prices from other exporters also declined. The price reductions stimulated trade, which recovered later in the year, boosted, in particular, by Japan's temporary lifting of its import ban and the abrupt deterioration of the Asian rice crop. With this poor crop, global output of paddy fell in 1993. The late upsurge of import demand resulted in an increase in total trade in 1993 of 4 percent to 14.5 million tonnes. Due to the decline in prices, the value of export earnings from rice fell 17 percent in 1993. For 1994, expectations were for trade to rise to a record level and for international prices to recover. Stocks were expected to decline in total for the third consecutive
year.
Following a strong recovery of global wheat production in 1992, import volume declined, world wheat stocks increased and international prices generally fell in 1992/93. However, the value of world wheat exports in calendar year 1992 actually rose 20 percent reflecting substantially increased prices during the first half of the year. The wheat import bill of the developing countries rose 25 percent to $10 000 million in 1992.
Supply and utilization were expected to more closely matched in 1993/94 as production in 1993 was unchanged but utilization was likely to expand. However, a further decline in import demand was anticipated to exert downward pressure on prices in general, although a likely shortage of high quality wheat was anticipated to result in much higher prices for wheat of this quality.
A sharp increase in coarse grain production in 1992, mainly in the United States, boosted export supplies in 1992/93. However, increased crops in the main importing countries, particularly the former USSR, reduced global import requirements. The enlarged supplies and the decline in import demand pushed prices down in 1992/93. Regionally, a notable exception to the overall import situation was where widespread crop losses due to drought led to increased imports. The 1992 import bill of developing countries leapt 27 percent to over $6000 million.
In 1993/94, in contrast, a much smaller crop was expected to be followed by a sharp reduction in carryover stocks, especially in the United States. A reversal in the price decline of the previous year occurred at the start of the season and was likely to be maintained. Global import demand and the volume of international trade were forecast to contract further in 1993/94, as a result of a strong recovery in production in southern Africa, reduced imports into the countries of the former USSR, and competition from feed wheat.
Other food and feed crops
Global cassava production rose substantially in 1993, mainly as a result of increased output in Africa. Global trade contracted, reflecting decreased shipments of cassava pellets to non-EC markets, including the Republic of Korea and the United States. Prices for cassava exported to the EC continued their downward trend in 1993, in line with falling feedgrain prices in the EC, and reached their lowest level for the last five years. Export earnings returned to those of years prior to the 1992 peak. The outlook for world production in 1994 was uncertain, with expectations of a contraction in the Far East but likely increases in the other regions. The tentative outlook for trade in 1994 was for a contraction reflecting an expected decline in shipment of pellets to the EC and to other destinations.
World production of pulses recovered in 1993, largely on account of a rise in output in the Far East, North America and the EC and prices for most pulses remained below the average of earlier years. Global utilization recovered from the low level of 1992 with increased food and feed consumption in the developing countries. The main change in the developed countries was some recovery in feed use which, however, remained below that of 1988-90. The volume of world trade was static but the pattern changed as exports from China and Australia expanded while those from Argentina contracted. Prospects for 1994 were for a slight decrease in global trade, resulting from reduced import demand in some developing countries and the EC, and lower export availabilities in developed countries. Downward pressure on the prices of some pulses was expected to continue.
Oils and oilmeals
The world oils and oilmeals economy continued to expand slowly in 1993. Growth in output and consumption of the two groups of commodities in the developing countries was well sustained although in some of these countries import demand was constrained by scarcity of foreign exchange. Output in the developed countries declined for oils, but increased somewhat for oilmeals, largely reflecting unfavourable weather and policy-induced reductions of plantings in the European Community. Unsettled economic and social conditions in Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR continued to affect both production and demand for the two groups of commodities. Structural changes in these economies in transition were also a major factor in preventing the volume of world trade from expanding further in 1993, although its value may have increased reflecting higher international market prices, especially in the second half of the year.
Prospects for 1994 pointed to continued sluggish growth for oils and a decline for oilmeals. Demand for both groups of commodities was likely to suffer from foreign exchange scarcity in some importing developing countries and from a further decline in Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR. Demand for oilmeals in the European Community was expected to shrink following changes in the CAP for grains, which would reduce the use of oilmeals in feed rations. A fall in the United States soybean crop would affect global output of oilmeals, while reduced output of soybean oil would be more than offset by increases in production of other oils, especially palm oil. On balance, the forecast volume of supplies of oils and oilmeals from the new crops did not seem to be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for consumption. Old-crop stocks would thus be drawn upon and there would be upward pressure on prices.
Livestock products
Consumption and production of meat was little changed in 1993. Production was constrained, particularly by higher feed costs and animal disease problems. Sluggish economic growth and the emergence of new trade barriers had a negative impact on demand for imports and on the volume of trade. However, a strengthening in international prices contributed to unchanged overall export earnings.
The preliminary outlook for 1994 was for production growth and lower prices for some meats especially poultry. International trade volume was expected to recover despite a continuation of restrictive import policies.
Divergence in the evolution of demand for milk products was reflected in the course of production and international prices. Demand in the developing countries continued to increase and consumption there rose slightly more than the 3 percent expansion in production. In most of the developed countries consumption of products with a high fat content, notably butter, declined but this was partly offset by increased consumption of low fat liquid milk, cheese, and other products. Even with a one percent reduction in production there were further subsidized disposals of butter, particularly by the EC and the United States. Major recipients of these sales were countries of the former USSR where production declined again in 1993, by approximately 9 percent.
Public stocks of butter and skimmed milk powder in North America and the EC either declined to lower levels or remained close to those already achieved. International prices for most dairy products were lower than in 1992. For 1994 the only price likely to decline is that of butter reflecting the growing preference for other dairy products and the decline in demand for butter fat.
Fibres
World cotton production declined by 14 percent in 1992/93, as area contracted in response to lower prices and yields declined. Consumption rose by 2.6 percent, reducing stocks by 6 percent from their recent peak level. A decline in the volume traded, coupled with a further decline in prices, resulted in a 25 percent contraction in export earnings. While production was likely to recover in 1993/94, consumption was forecast to increase more rapidly leading to a further contraction in stocks and setting the stage for a recovery in prices. An expansion in volumes traded and a recovery in prices could result in a significant increase in the value of cotton traded in 1993/94.
World stocks of jute, kenaf and allied fibres were expected to fall sharply by the end of the 1993/94 season following two successive short crops. The recovery in prices, however, was likely to be constrained by recession in some markets and disruption of the markets of eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR which dampened growth in demand for jute products. Exports of fibre fell for the third consecutive year in 1992/93, while exports of products maintained a slight upward trend, mainly because of rising imports into the developing countries. The combined export earnings of fibre and products also decreased again and was 13 percent below the average for 1988/89 to 1990/91.
Export earnings of all hard fibres and their manufactures rose slightly in 1993 following a 4 percent decline in 1992. International market prices for sisal recovered markedly and, while production contracted, exports recovered a little as stocks in producing countries were drawn down. Prices of sisal harvest twine, however, declined further. In 1994 an expected expansion of output of sisal and henequen would lead to a fall in prices for these fibres. Abaca production in 1993 was again constrained by drought in the Philippines and prices held the increased levels of the previous year. Attempts to expand production would, if successful, be likely to lead to some decline in prices in 1994. Production of brown coir fibre and of coir yarn expanded further in 1993 but, despite some lift in prices, the aggregate value of trade in coir and coir products was constrained by a further contraction in import demand for yarn.
Other raw materials
Prices for natural rubber fell in 1993 from the already low levels of the previous year. The INRO Daily Market Indicator Price (DMIP) remained around and even below the "must buy" level of 166 Malaysia/Singapore cents/kg most of the time. The decline was influenced not only by lower demand growth but also by the prospect of the collapse of the International Natural Rubber Agreement and the eventual liquidation of the INRO buffer stock. World production of natural rubber rose at a slower rate than in 1992, but nevertheless exceeded utilization, which was depressed in many major markets. Export earnings from natural rubber rose in 1992, but were estimated to fall in 1993 with the decline in export volumes and prices.
Early forecasts indicated that growth in demand for natural rubber would accelerate in 1994. A recovery was expected in the automobile and tyre industries in Western Europe and Japan, which had experienced recession in 1993, and expansion was also envisaged for the non-tyre sector in major consuming countries. Global production was anticipated to increase at a lower rate than in the previous two years. World consumption could exceed production, and thus prices were likely to rise.
The continued depression in global demand for hides and skins in 1993 reflected reduced consumer expenditures on leather manufactures in the major economies affected by persisting recession. Average prices of bovine hides recovered slightly in 1993 after declining in 1992. However, the value of leather and leather product exports from the major developing countries fell in 1992 for the first time in ten years. Global output of bovine hides and sheep and lambskins declined in 1993 and no significant changes were expected for 1994. With demand remaining depressed, prices for most types of hides and skins were unlikely to show any substantial increase in the short-term.
Never before had citrus supplies, in both fresh and processed forms, been higher than in 1992/93. Production was 7 percent more than in the record season of 1991/92 and amounted to the equivalent of 76 million tonnes of fresh fruit. In contrast, exports of processed products rose only 2 percent, and those of fresh fruit declined 2 percent. Factors affecting import demand included the availability of alternative products and the dampening effect of the continued recession in leading importing countries. The resultant price collapse was expected to continue at least into the first half of 1993/94 when supplies, although forecast to be somewhat less than 1992/93, at 72 million tonnes, were still considered to be larger than expected exports. However, several prospective developments were anticipated to favour a lift in prices, especially towards the second half of the season. These included structural re-adjustments in the production and processing sectors, and an expansion of
demand.
Wine output in 1993/94 was expected to be 8 percent less than in the previous year mainly due to a fall in EC output. It was expected that production in the developing countries would be similar to the previous year reflecting stable production in Argentina and Chile but with a larger proportion of quality wine to boost exports. The recent tendency towards a greater proportion of quality wine in output and trade continued and price rises induced by lower output will be in quality wines. By contrast, prices of table wine declined in the early part of the 1993/94 season.
Production of tobacco continued to increase and was 6 percent greater than consumption in 1993. This followed a similar imbalance in the previous year and as a result stocks increased by 17 percent from the start of 1992 to the end of 1993. Most of the expansion in production was in the developing countries. In 1992 their exports increased in volume but declined in value. By contrast, leaf exports of the developed countries shrank in volume but gained in value. In addition, the value of cigarette exports by the developed countries continued to increase. Prices at leaf auctions fell sharply in 1993 and although exports from the developing countries were projected to rise, gains will be more than offset by the reduced prices. With stocks at the end of 1993 close to a year's consumption and some quantitative restrictions on imports, the outlook is for a continuation of depressed prices.
World fish catch marginally rises
In 1992, the global fish catch was 99 million tonnes, 2 million tonnes more than in 1991. However, this increase in production came exclusively from higher output by China, while all other major fish catching nations reported unchanged or declining catches. The quantity of fishery products entering international trade declined in 1992 but due to higher prices the total value of exports rose by 2 percent. A similar expansion in the global value of trade was estimated for 1993. The developing countries as a group maintained their 45 percent share of total exports in 1992. Imports by developed countries, accounting for 85 percent of the total. Japan alone accounted for 28 percent. Dramatic reports about the reduction in Chinese shrimp production overshadowed the market in 1993, leading to substantial price increases. Tuna catches continued to be disappointing in all of the main fishing areas and by the end of 1993 prices paid by canneries were about 40 percent above those of
the same months in the previous year. Sales of groundfish in the United States in the summer and autumn recovered from the depressed levels of 1992 but were very sensitive to price changes. The octopus market was extremely depressed during 1993. Prices declined in the course of the year as the Japanese market was oversupplied. Supplies of salmon, which used to be a luxury item, became more and more abundant in the closing months of 1993 and sold for little more than cod.
Forest products
In 1992 there was a partial recovery of forest product markets after the severe decline in 1991. Global roundwood production rose by 1.5 percent mainly due to the growth of fuelwood production in the developing countries and the recovery of industrial roundwood markets in North America and some countries in Asia. Industrial roundwood production was, however, still well below the levels achieved in the late 1980s as demand for industrial roundwood and wood products remained depressed in Western Europe and Japan and continued to fall sharply in countries of the former USSR and in some Eastern European countries.
Production of paper and paperboard continued to grow but at a slower rate than in previous years. In contrast, high rates of growth continued in several developing countries in South East Asia. However the industry was characterized by both low profitability and capacity utilisation. Although production of paper continued to rise, output of wood pulp declined slightly reflecting the increasing trend to use waste paper, backed, in a number of countries, by legislative measures.
The value of trade in forest products grew by 6 percent in 1992 after two years of stagnation. Exports of coniferous sawnwood increased notably from Canada to the United States and from Scandinavia to Western Europe, favoured by the devaluation of the Swedish and Finnish currencies. Trade in tropical timber stagnated but reduced log exports were offset by increases in sawnwood, plywood and further manufactured products. Prices of mechanical wood products tended to rise but those for pulpwood and wood pulp, in Europe, were at their lowest level for many years because of the depressed demand and enlarged supplies.
In 1993 forest product markets in North American continued their strong recovery. In contrast, demand in Western Europe and Japan was depressed, and output of wood products in most Eastern European and in the countries of the former USSR continued to fall.
Prices in the United States increased sharply at the beginning of 1993 due in part to restrictions on supplies from the United States' Federal forests of the Pacific Northwest arising from environmental concerns for wildlife habitat protection. The effects spread to international markets especially those in Asia where coniferous logs and sawnwood have largely come from the United States. Prices for temperate timber in Asia escalated to unprecedented levels, which favoured exports from other countries such as Chile and New Zealand with their large areas of plantation forests. In addition further restrictions on the harvesting of tropical logs tended to lift export prices for tropical sawnwood and plywood. In the second half of 1993 prices of both temperate and tropical wood products in North America and East Asia declined but were yet some 30-40 percent above their levels in the previous year.

The Uruguay round agreement
After seven years of negotiations the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations were concluded on 15 December 1993. The Final Act of the Uruguay Round is wider in Scope than any of its predecessors, covering agreements and decisions on a wide variety of subjects of great economic significance to the world economy, This note focuses on the Agreement on Agriculture, the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Decision concerning the least developed and net food importing developing countries. An essential part of the Final Act is the Schedules of Commitments country by country, and commodity by commodity and these were not to be available before its signature at the Marrakech Ministerial Meeting in April 1994.
Description of the Agreement on Agriculture
The implementation of the Agreement on Agriculture will start in 1995, and the commitments of the developed countries to expand market access and to reduce domestic support and export subsidies should be completed within six years, by the year 2000, whereas the commitments of the developing countries should be completed within ten years, that is by the year 2004. The least developed countries are not required to make any reductions.
There are three elements to the commitments on market access: tariffication; tariff reduction and access opportunities. First, members must tariffy their non-tariff barriers (NTB) such as quotas, variable levies, minimum import prices, discretionary licensing, state trading measures and voluntary restraint agreements. These have to be abolished and converted into an equivalent ad valorem or specific tariff. The basic approach is to set a tariff equal to the difference in 1986-88 between the internal price, typically the domestic wholesale price, and the external price, typically the import unit value c.i.f. converted into national currency.
The commitment of developed countries to cut ordinary tariffs, including those resulting from tariffication, is that they be cut by an average 36 percent across all commodities in the six years starting in 1995, with a minimum rate of reduction of 15 percent for each tariff item. For developing countries the cuts are 24 percent on average and a minimum cut of 10 percent. The tariff reduction will be undertaken in equal annual installments and all customs duties will be bound in the GATT.
Where there are no significant imports, a minimum access amount will be established for 1995 equal to 3 percent of domestic consumption in 1986-88 rising to 5 percent of the base figure by the end of the implementation period. Minimum access opportunities will be implemented by a tariff quota with a low rate of tariff set on a Most Favoured Nation (MFN) basis. In the case where current access opportunities are more than the minimum, these will be maintained and increased during the implementation process.
The Agreement on Agriculture contains important special safeguard provisions which allow the imposition of additional duties when there are either import surges or particularly low prices, both compared with levels in 1986-88. In the case of import surges, imposition of additional duties should not exceed one-third of the ordinary customs duties in effect. In the case of low import prices, measured in the national currency, an additional duty can be charged which progressively increases as the price level drops further below the 1986-88 level.
The general approach adopted to domestic support has been to divide policies into two groups: (i) policies which have minimal or no production or trade distorting effects, those in the "Green Box" and (ii) policies subject to reduction commitments. The total support given to agriculture in 1986-88 by the latter policies, as measured by the Total Aggregate Measure of Support (Total AMS), is to be reduced by 20 percent in the developed countries over the period 1995-2000 and 13.3 percent in the developing countries over the period 1995-2004. Reduction commitments refer to total levels of support and not to individual commodities.
In addition to the "Green Box" category, some other policies are excluded from the AMS. These include, for the developing countries, investment subsidies that are generally available to agriculture and agricultural input subsidies generally available to poor farmers in these countries. Policies which amount to a small percentage transfer to producers, less than 5 percent of the value of production for developed countries, less than 10 percent for developing countries, are also excluded under the de minimis rule. Finally, direct payments through production-limiting programmes have been excluded from the AMS, providing certain conditions are met, namely, that they are decoupled or payments are made on 85 percent or less of production in the base period or that such payments are based on fixed area and yield or on a fixed number of head of livestock.
The Agreement on Agriculture spells out a list of export subsidies that are to be reduced including: direct subsidies; sale from stocks by governments at prices lower than the domestic market price; export payments financed by obligatory levies; subsidized export marketing costs, and special domestic transport charges. The volume of exports benefiting from such subsidies must be reduced by 21 percent and the expenditure on export subsidies by 36 percent over the 1995-2000 period. Reductions will be implemented on a product-specific basis. Calculation of the commodity-specific final level of subsidized exports is based on average 1986-90 levels. However, exporters would in certain cases be allowed to maintain a higher level of subsidized exports in the years up to 1999, by availing themselves of a special option. Under this option countries may start to make reductions from the subsidized levels of 1991-92 or 1986-90, whichever is higher, though they would still be required
to achieve the same final level of reduction by the year 2000.
Green box
"Green Box" policies, which are exempt from reduction commitments, are those that do not entail price support to producers and for which the support is provided by the government and not by the consumers. The list of exempted policies is very long and includes such policies as general services (research, training, extension, inspection, marketing and promotion, infrastructure), food security stocks, domestic food aid, and certain direct payments to producers (decoupled income insurance and safety net programmes, disaster relief, producer or resource retirement schemes, investment aids, environmental programmes and regional assistance).
The Agreement on Agriculture also provides for prevention of circumvention of export subsidy commitments, including some important provisions on food aid, namely: that it should not be tied directly or indirectly to commercial exports; that food aid transactions should be carried out in accordance with FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal; and that such aid should be provided to the extent possible in fully grant form or on terms no less concessional than those provided for in Article IV of the Food Aid Convention 1986.
A late addition to the Agreement on Agriculture was Article 12 on disciplines on Export Prohibition and Restriction, which concerns limitations on exports of foodstuffs taken under Article XI 2(a) of the GATT that allows such restrictions "temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party". Exporters must in future consider the effects on importing members' food security and must consult with importing members having a substantial interest at their request.
Special and differential treatment for developing countries is an integral part of the Agreement on Agriculture, although what has been provided may not necessarily be adequate. Special and differential treatment basically has three elements. First, as discussed above, developing countries are given more time to adjust and are expected to make smaller reductions in support, including a higher de minimis level. Moreover, the least developed countries are exempt from the reduction commitments altogether.
The second area where special and differential treatment applies concerns the various types of policies that are "acceptable" to the GATT. As regards export subsidies, developing countries are allowed to provide subsidies to reduce the marketing costs of agricultural products and differential internal transport costs, which developed countries must curtail. Regarding domestic support the "Green Box" category has special provision for developing countries in regard to public stockholding for food security purposes and domestic food aid. Developing countries may also exclude from the calculation of the Total AMS the following policies: (i) investment subsidies which are generally available to agriculture, (ii) domestic support to producers to encourage diversification from the growing of illicit narcotic crops, and (iii) agricultural input subsidies Provided to low-income or resource poor producers which are available to all producers.
Thirdly, there are special provisions for developing countries contained in the Decision on "Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food Importing Developing Countries". The idea behind this Decision was that agricultural trade liberalization is likely to lead to higher world prices for food while a reduction in export subsidies will also raise the effective price paid by importers, There was also some concern that the volume of food aid, which historically has been closely linked to the level of surplus stocks, could contract in future with a rundown of surplus stocks. Action promised in this Decision includes: improving the level and terms of food aid; giving full consideration to requests for technical and financial assistance to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure; that in any agreement on export credits "appropriate provision" would be made for differential treatment in favour of these
countries; and the provision of short term assistance in financing normal commercial imports from international financial institutions under "existing facilities, or such facilities as may be established, in the context of adjustment programmes".
The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) recognizes that governments have the right to take sanitary and phytosanitary measures but that they should be applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between members where identical or similar conditions prevail.
In order to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, members are encouraged to base their measures on international standards, guidelines and recommendations where they exist, including the Codex Alimentarius and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). However, members may maintain or introduce measures which result in higher standards if there is scientific justification or as a consequence of consistent decisions based on an appropriate risk assessment. The Agreement on SPS spells out procedures and criteria for the assessment of risk and the determination of adequate levels of protection.
It is expected that members would accept the sanitary and phytosanitary measures of others as equivalent if the exporter demonstrates to the importing member that its measures achieve a level of protection appropriate to the importer. The Agreement on SPS includes provisions on control, inspection and approval procedures.
The Agreement on SPS also contains requirements on transparency, including the publication of regulations, the establishment of national enquiry points and notification procedures. It also establishes a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures which, among other things, would provide a forum for consultations, maintain contact with other relevant organizations and monitor the process of international harmonization.
Preliminary assessment
A number of studies have attempted to assess the effect of the eventual Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture; some of these are summarized below. However it must be noted that a full assessment can only be made after the Schedules of Commitments are finalized.
The Agreement on Agriculture represents only a partial liberalization agreement. Overall, the cuts in support to agriculture are relatively small and spread out over a number of years. Regarding domestic support, a large number of policies have been excluded from reduction commitments and only part of those included is to be reduced. The market access provisions are likely to have a greater effect on trade. Perhaps the most important provision is the commitment to reduce subsidized exports. Overall, however, a large degree of distortion in the world agricultural commodity market will still remain even after the complete implementation of the reduction commitments.
In general, and compared with trend, increases in world prices of 5 to 10 percent were forecast for temperate zone products which in the past have enjoyed high levels of assistance, particularly in the developed countries (Table 8). A reduction in support should lead to a lower output in these countries than what would otherwise have been the case, with consequential effects on world market price levels. In contrast, the prices of tropical products are unlikely to change greatly.
Export earnings of developing countries from tropical products may thus not be affected by much in view of the small changes expected in world market prices and the relatively inelastic demand of the main consuming countries for these commodities. As regards temperate zone products, it can be expected that export earnings will rise especially those of the low cost exporters; export earnings of developing countries would depend to a large extent on their net trade position in these commodities.
Overall, the implementation of the total Uruguay Round package ought to have positive effects on developing country export earnings, with most gains coming from the ending of restraints on textile and clothing exports under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). An analysis of the detailed losses and gains must however await publication of the detailed schedules.
The effects of trade liberalization on the stability of international prices, especially those of cereals, have also been the subject of considerable debate with most commentators arguing that prices would become more stable. This conclusion is based largely on the fact that with the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade, all countries will absorb shocks in the world market to a greater degree than before, thus dampening market instability.
It was also noted that the Final Act allows for special safeguard measures in the event of import surges or sharp falls in import prices from their base period level. Countries would thereby be allowed to introduce temporary additional import duties to stabilize domestic prices to a fairly high degree. The problem with this clause is that it makes for accentuation of the problem of falling prices on international markets. If import prices fall considerably below the base year level the safeguard clause would lead to a sharp rise in import duties and thus a reduction in import demand putting further downward pressure on world prices. Not only is this clause unhelpful in this respect but it probably cannot be used by many developing countries. This is because the price level that triggers safeguard action is set in nominal national currency terms, while many developing countries face significant rates of inflation and currency depreciation which will raise the future import
prices in national currency well above the base year levels. The whole question of the effect of inflation on commitments is to be reviewed by the Committee on Agriculture, which is to be established within the World Trade Organization.

Possible increases in net foreign exchange earnings referred to above are only part of the overall effects on incomes arising from the Uruguay Round agreements. Other potential and substantial gains would be derived from a more efficient use of domestic resources when distortions of domestic prices and markets are reduced or removed. Such income gains for the world as a whole from multisector partial liberalization have been estimated to be in the order of $200 billion. Income gains were estimated to be broadly spread across regions with the share of developing countries as a group calculated at over 40 percent. However, these income gains would also rely considerably on widespread liberalization of domestic markets.
Of greater significance than the quantitative effects of the Uruguay Round agreement is probably its implications for agricultural policies, particularly in the long run. The way in which agricultural policies are undertaken is likely to change radically in the future. First and foremost this concerns the list of policies that are discouraged and those that are acceptable, according to the Final Act. The former includes the classical forms of guaranteed, target, indicative or procurement prices which are maintained at levels above those on the world market. The future is for targeted, non-price, decoupled forms of support. However, many of these "Green Box" policies are costly to governments and hence may be not affordable in many developing countries.
Next in terms of significance is the demise of most non-tariff barriers to trade and their conversion into tariffs by tariffication. This allows import prices to vary with variations in world prices and hence improves the quality of price signals sent to producers and consumers. Trade regimes in future should be much more transparent. However this is not to say that new obstacles to trade will not arise.
The disciplines on export subsidies and export restraints are important in principle because they bring agriculture closer to the other sectors. Fundamentally, export subsidies are not acceptable but will be tolerated for the time being and disciplined. Moreover it will be difficult for countries that have not used them in the past to have recourse to export subsidies.
The broad thrust of these changes in the policymaking environment is equally applicable to developed and developing countries. For most developing countries, however, any policy initiatives will take place within the framework of structural adjustment programmes. In agricultural and food policy, there is currently a general trend towards more precise targeting of policies to particular groups of beneficiaries. This trend is partly a consequence of increasing concern with the administrative difficulties and excessive costs of many current policies and broadly reflects the requirements of structural adjustment programmes.
The dual influences of changes in the international trading environment and structural adjustment programmes, generally require governments in developing countries to shift the focus of their interventions away from attempts to influence the price mechanism. The required shift is likely to be towards investment in the infrastructure of the agricultural economy, including programmes to develop the marketing services and appropriate storage facilities accessible to the rural population. In addition, a shift in resources away from direct input subsidies to enhanced credit provision may be considered on account of the superior allocative efficiency of the latter, as well as its potentially more progressive nature and greater targeting facility.
In conclusion, therefore, the implications for the developing countries are significant mainly in the way in which agricultural policies are to be formulated in the future. Whether the change is motivated by the new GATT disciplines or by structural adjustment policies, both point in a rather similar direction, one where actions to influence prices are no longer the main instruments of agricultural policy. Whether, however, it will always be feasible for developing countries to adopt non pricedistorting policies is a matter that requires further analysis.

Other policy responses to trade problems
Agricultural support and protection
In the OECD countries, total policy-induced transfers to agriculture from consumers and taxpayers, rose to $354 billion in 1992, some 7 percent more than in 1991. The EC, Japan and the United States increased transfers by almost equal amounts, whereas for most other developed countries they fell from 1991 to 1992, and by more than 10 percent in Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden.
The estimated Producer Subsidy Equivalents (PSEs) also indicate an increase in the support to agricultural producers in the OECD countries as a whole. The net total PSE increased from $175 billion in 1991 to $180 billion in 1992, a 2.5 percent increase. Measured in domestic currencies, however, the net total PSE increased in only two countries, Japan and the United States. Expressed as a percentage of the value of agricultural production at the farm gate, the PSE measure for the OECD area as a whole remained at 44 percent in 1992, the same as in 1991. However, the percentage PSE again differed widely between countries, ranging from 3 percent for New Zealand to 75 percent for Switzerland and 77 percent for Norway.
Livestock products continued to account for the bulk of the total support in the OECD area, $109 billion out in 1992 of the total $180 billion. This support rose by 3.5 percent between 1991 and 1992 compared to a one percent increase in support to crops during the same period. Milk continued to receive the largest support in absolute terms at $55 billion, followed by beef and veal at $36 billion, rice at $23 billion, coarse grains at $18 billion and wheat at $17 billion.
Certain moves toward more liberalization in agricultural trade continued in 1992-1993, both in OECD countries and in the developing countries, at unilateral and regional levels. Some of the most ambitious trade measures are being taken by a number of developing countries and the former centrally planned economies.
GATT dispute settlement
Contracting parties to the GATT have continued to make extensive use of the Agreement's dispute settlement procedures. Requests for consultations under the GATT rose to 26 in the 12 months ending in September 1993 from 11 in the previous year. Recent requests for consultations concerning trade disputes in agricultural products were made with regard to: EC restrictions on imports of apples by Chile and lemons by Argentina; United States' proposed legislation imposing a 75 percent local content requirement on tobacco for the manufacture of cigarettes, by eight developing countries; Argentina's restrictions on canned peaches from Greece and dairy products from the EC, by the EC; and EC export subsidies on glac cherries, by Australia.
Independent dispute panels to probe eight new trade complaints were established in the 12-month period ending in September 1993, the same as in the previous year. As regards agricultural products, disputes at the panel stage included: Argentina's negotiating rights with the EC on oilseeds; United States restrictions on imports of tuna caught inconsistently with US laws protecting dolphins, brought by the EC and the Netherlands; United States restrictions on softwood lumber and salmon, brought by Canada and Norway respectively; Australia's restrictions on imports of glac cherries, brought by the EC; the EC's import regime for bananas brought by five Latin American countries; Brazil's restrictions on imports of milk powder, brought by the EC; EC restrictions on imports of pork and beef, brought by the United States; and Canada's restrictions on imports of beer and boneless beef, brought by the United States and the EC respectively.
The overall effectiveness of the GATT dispute settlements system was the subject of numerous complaints at meetings of GATT's Council. Complaints mainly concerned delays in the adoption of panel reports, non-implementation of adopted panel reports in a number of longstanding disputes, and unilateral measures and countermeasures by parties to disputes. These difficulties were reflected in a fall off in the number of panel recommendations adopted by the GATT Council. In the 12-month period ending in September 1993 only one panel recommendation was adopted compared to eight in the previous period, and as many as 12 of the previously adopted panel reports had not been implemented. Concerning agricultural products, ongoing disputes on the pace of implementation of panel reports included recommendations to the United States on alcoholic and malt beverages and on imports of sugar, to Canada on certain alcoholic drinks, to the Republic of Korea on imports of beef and beer, to the EC
on oilseed subsidies, and to Japan on imports of certain agricultural products. In some cases countries made their implementation of panel recommendations conditional to a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. Historically, however, the GATT system of settling international trade disputes has been relatively effective according to a recent study of 207 complaints, including 89 concerning agricultural products, put before dispute settlement panels from 1948 to 1989. Four out of five valid complaints were dealt with successfully according to the study. This high rate of success in resolving complaints was the same for both manufactures and agricultural products, although more of the agricultural complaints were sustained by panel reports. As regards GATT panel failures, the study found that a high percentage of them dealt with disputes over anti-dumping actions or countervailing duties.
GATT, the environment and trade
In 1993, the GATT Group on Environmental Measures and International Trade continued discussion of the transparency of trade-related environmental measures, consistency of multilateral environmental agreements with GATT rules, and labelling and packaging issues.
As regards multilateral transparency of national environmental regulations, the Group concluded that in order to avoid conflict between trade and the environment, adequate and timely notification of all measures likely to have a trade effect was crucial. There was a general consensus that transparency in this area should not be more strict than in other areas; that the measures to be notified to GATT should have substantial trade effects; and that there was a need to establish trade-environment national contact points.
Two possible options have emerged on how GATT could deal with trade provisions in existing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs): (i) a collective interpretation of GATT Article XX that would provide a general exception for agreements that reflected genuinely multilateral consensus; and (ii) a case-by-case granting of waivers under Article XXV. Available evidence indicated that conflicts between trade measures in MEAs and GATT rules have arisen only in exceptional situations. Of 152 such agreements reviewed by the GATT Secretariat, only 17 contained trade provisions, and of those, only 2 appeared to treat parties and non-parties to the agreement differently. The general consensus in the Group was that should trade policy measures be found necessary for the enforcement of environmental objectives, then certain principles should apply, including: non-discrimination; necessity, that is to say the trade measures taken must be necessary to prevent developments in trade
from undermining the objectives of the MEA; proportionality, implying that trade measures pursuant to the MEA should not be more severe and should not remain in force any longer than necessary to achieve their environmental objective; and choice of the least trade-restrictive measures. There was also general consensus that unilateral action to deal with environmental problems outside the jurisdiction of an importing country should be avoided; and that action on "process and production methods" (PPMs) as well as transborder and global environmental problems should, as far as possible, be based on international consensus.
Packaging and labelling requirements generated the most specific discussion in the Group, partly reflecting the fact that new packaging and labelling regulations had already had an impact on international trade. In the past, packaging requirements focused on public health and safety concerns. New and important environmental considerations include the reduction of packaging material entering the waste stream and the resource intensity of packaging. The variety of packaging requirements and regulations that exist in different countries appeared to reflect, to a large degree, differences in nations' endowments of materials from which to manufacture packaging and of disposal facilities to deal with the waste, as well as differences in the preferences of industry and consumers. As regards eco-labelling schemes, transparency though timely and detailed notification of labelling requirements would minimize possible restrictive effects on trade.
Environmental protection measures
An increasing number of countries have made environmental protection measures an integral component of their agricultural policies in recent years. This trend has been more widespread in the developed food exporting countries where a relatively small farm sector and abundant production of food permit governments greater flexibility in diverting arable land from farming into more environmentally-friendly land uses, and in the provision of adequate public spending to support such measures. Measures initiated or implemented during 1992-93 in developed countries are summarized below.
In Australia, the Government launched a National Landcare Programme (NLP) in 1992 which consolidated ongoing land, water and revegetation programmes and empowered farmers to address their problems of land degradation collectively through Landcare Groups. By end-1992, the Government had allocated about A$63 million ($43 million) to some 1 300 approved Landcare projects. In Austria, the "Green Fallow" programme, which pays farmers for leaving land fallow and promotes soil conservation and other environmental protection objectives, was continued in 1992/93. In addition, the fuel tax refund scheme was abolished as of January 1992 and replaced with a Federal premium scheme rewarding crop rotation that is beneficial to the environment. Similarly, restrictions have been placed on the upper limits of fertilizer use. The Government also raised payments for farming using approved "organic" methods from 2 million schillings ($0.18 million) in 1991 to 56 million schillings ($5 million)
in 1992. In Canada, the Green Plan Sustainable Agriculture Initiative was provided with a further C$170 million ($134 million) for promoting soil conservation and alternative sources of energy. Funding was also raised to implement improvements in the regulatory system for pesticides.
In the European Community, a number of agri-environmental and re-afforestation measures were announced in 1992 as part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, several countries of the Community undertook other measures aimed at this goal. Thus in Denmark, farming is prohibited within two metres of water edges for which no compensation is paid; in the Netherlands, farmers' use of chemical soil disinfectants has been restricted since 1 February 1992 to once every four years and then only with prior authorization.
In Finland, amendments were made to the environmental programme introduced in 1992. Accordingly, in place of a general fertilizer levy, farmers now pay a levy according to the nutrient contents of fertilizers. Extra compensation was paid in 1993 to farmers who grew "green fallow" crops that were not allowed to be harvested. In addition, organic farming was further promoted through increased payments. In Norway, environmental measures were expanded to meet objectives such as landscape conservation, protecting biodiversity and promoting "ecological" farming. The levies on nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were raised by 3 percent. In Sweden, environmental protection measures were strengthened within the framework of the 1990 Food and Agricultural Policy. For 1992/93, 250 million kroners ($35 million) were allocated to support a programme on "open and varied" agricultural landscape. Considerable progress was also made in reducing the quantities of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides used in farming. In Switzerland, two new payment schemes, covering extensive cereals production and grassland use, were introduced in 1992/93 to discourage the intensification of farming.
In the United States, the largest environmental protection programme remains the Conservation Reserve Program under which about 15 million hectares of cropland susceptible to erosion have been emoted for a minimum of 10 years since 1986. Several related provisions of the 1990 Farm Act were also implemented, or expanded, in 1992. Thus, the Integrated Farm Management Program Option, which encourages resource-conserving crop rotations, was expanded in 1992 to a maximum of 2 million hectares, of which about 40 000 hectares had been enroled by the end of 1992. Similarly, the Agricultural Water Quality Protection Program, which aims to reduce nonpoint source agricultural pollutants through modification of management systems, came into effect in 1992.
Developments in regional trading arrangements
Since the early 1990s regional integration activities have intensified, In the European Community, the establishment of the Single European Market in January 1993 marked substantial progress with removal of customs controls on trade between member states. Subsequent ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the EC's 12 member states established a number of longer term objectives towards their economic union in the fields of fiscal, monetary and socio-economic policies. Its provisions also established a common framework and objectives for policies towards developing countries. In these and other matters the Maastricht Treaty extended the realm of integration of the 12 members' policies and created the European Union (EU).
The European Economic Area (EEA) became effective at the start of 1994. The EEA was formed by the treaty between the EC and members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) except Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The EEA builds upon the free trade agreements concluded between each of the EFTA countries and the EC in 1972 and 1973, and has led to virtually free movement of non-agricultural goods, services, capital and labour between member States. Intra-EEA tariffs will also be removed from a small number of agricultural products. In addition, adoption of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by EFTA countries over a 5 year transition period was expected to reduce agricultural production in these countries. The most sensitive agricultural sector in the ECEFTA enlargement negotiations would be dairying which is one of the most highly protected sectors in both regions,
The Central European Free Trade Area (CEFTA) was established in December 1992. The agreement covers some agricultural items, mostly negotiated bilaterally. Liberalization of tariffs and quantitative restrictions would be done in three stages between March 1993 and 2001. There were also various agreements between the EC and Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, which were expanded by parallel arrangements with EFTA countries in 1993.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was ratified in 1993 to come force at the start of 1994 and to be fully implemented by 2008. NAFTA sets out separate bilateral undertakings on cross-border trade in agricultural products, one between the United States and Mexico and the other between Canada and Mexico. In general, the agricultural rules of the existing Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement on tariff and non-tariff barriers will continue to apply. The major agricultural issues addressed in NAFTA are nontariff barriers, tariffs, safeguards for producers, rules of origin, and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. Other NAFTA provisions of relevance to agriculture include dispute settlement procedures, investments, intellectual property protection, and transportation. Although it is too early to assess fully the effect of NAFTA on trade of agricultural products, it is expected that the Agreement will stimulate economic growth, particularly in Mexico,
possibly resulting in trade creation within NAFTA countries for commodities such as vegetables and fruits, beverages, tobacco, and some cereals. The United States introduced some tariff preferences in favour of Bolivia and Colombia in 1992 under its Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) of 1991. Duty-free treatment would be given to all products with the exception of textiles and apparel, footwear, certain leather products, canned tuna and rum. These preferences were scheduled to last until December 2001 and could eventually be extended to Ecuador and Peru.

(COMESA)
In Latin America and the Caribbean, members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) agreed to establish a common external tariff of 20 percent for most products with tariff reductions to start in June 1993 and to reach free trade by the end of 1995. The Organization of Central American States was replaced by the Central American Integration System (SICA) in February 1993 and members signed the Panama Agricultural Agreement to eliminate existing trade barriers affecting regional agricultural trade, and to harmonize tariffs on maize and sorghum. In the Andean Group the free trade area officially entered into force at the end of 1992 and in March 1993 their Commission of the Cartagena Agreement approved a common external tariff to be applied in 1994 (Bolivia and Ecuador have until 1995), and a full common market by 1995. Some progress has made in the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) towards establishing a common external tariff regime, which should enter into
force before 1995.
In Asia, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) launched programmes for establishing the ASEAN Free Trade Area, by the year 2008 and a Common Effective Preferential Tariff scheme was implemented on January 1993. Since then, some member countries have made unilateral cuts in tariffs. Member countries subsequently agreed to bring forward the full implementation of tariff reductions to 1 January 1994. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member countries established a SAARC Preferential Trading Agreement at a summit meeting in early 1993, as a first step towards higher levels of trade and economic cooperation in the region. The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) expanded its members by accession of Mexico and Papua New Guinea in November 1993. In addition, the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) adopted preferential tariffs to facilitate trade among member countries in April 1993. The ECO was initially formed by the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in 1964 and was recently joined by Afghanistan and six newly independent Asian republics of the former USSR.
In Africa there were also some moves towards regional integration. In November 1993, the 18 member states of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) signed the treaty aiming at establishing a Common Market for Eastern and Southern African states by the year 2000. In West Africa, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has launched programmes for attaining a free-trade area by the year 2000.
Changes in trade preference schemes
One of the more important developments during 1992-93 was the extension of the General System of Preferences (GSP) to the Eastern European countries to facilitate their transition towards market economies. Changes in the other donors' GSP schemes, relating to the developing countries, are detailed below.
Canada added Cambodia, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Solomon Islands, Zaire and Zambia to its list of least developed beneficiary countries from 9 March 1993. Sweden's GSP scheme was extended to Brunei Darussalam in 1993 and Uganda, owing to its status as a least developed country, was granted preferential treatment for all its products. Switzerland added Cambodia, Madagascar, the Solomon Islands, Zambia and Zaire to its scheme. Duty-free imports of GSP-eligible items by the United States rose 22 percent in 1992 to $16 700 million from $13 000 million in 1991. The comparable increase in the United States' total imports from all countries was 2 percent. In addition, approximately 22 percent of all imports from GSP beneficiary countries had also entered the United States MFN duty-free. In 1993 the European Community scheme was extended without change, at least as far as its structure was concerned. The Community also decided in 1993 to extend the MFA textiles section of
its scheme to Viet Nam, and to add Cambodia, Liberia, Madagascar, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Zaire and Zambia to the list of those countries benefiting from the conditions applied to the least developed nations.
Compensation and stabilization arrangements
Developing countries purchased some 100 million SDR under the IMF Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF) in 1992 and even less in 1993. In contrast, annual average purchases in the 1980s were about 1000 million SDR, resulting in average repayments during the 1991-93 period of about the same amount annually. Further, the cereal import facility has only been used once in the 1990s. Reduced use of the CCFF was in part due to the availability of cheaper credit under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) and the Enhanced SAF (ESAF) to low-income countries undertaking structural adjustment programmes. The IMF has encouraged countries to use the SAF and ESAF recognizing that balance-of-payments difficulties are largely due to structural problems and can no longer be treated as short-term, reversible fluctuations in export earnings for which the CCFF was meant to be the response,
The financial resources allocated to the EC's STABEX system under Lom IV (1991-95) amounted to 1500 million ECU (1400 million SDR). Even with more than half of these resources transferred during 1991 and 1992, some 877 million ECU (812 million SDR), they represented a coverage of only 35 percent of estimated ACP shortfalls. Some 80 percent of transfers in this period were for shortfalls in coffee and cocoa export earnings. Thus, STABEX resources have been chronically short of the demand made upon them in the prolonged period of depressed prices and earnings of intended beneficiary countries.
Switzerland's compensatory financing scheme continued to benefit certain developing countries exporting to that country. The initial 1989 allocation of 40 million Swiss Francs (20 million SDR) earmarked for this programme, was increased in 1990 to 90 million Swiss Francs (49 million SDR) for a four-year period starting in 1991, for financing either as part of multilateral co-financing or under a bilateral agreement.
Common Fund for Commodities: more projects approved in 1993
The Fund's decision-making body on projects approved 13 projects in 1993 bringing the total endorsed under its Second Account operations to 19. Of these projects, six were sponsored by International Commodity Bodies (ICBs) serviced by FAO of which one had certain provisions attached before funds would be committed. The budgets of these 6 projects add up to about $19 million. The Common Fund's share would be just over one third, the remaining two thirds coming from co-financing by other donors, including the World Bank, and counterpart contributions by participating countries and national or international research institutions. The First Account of the Fund remained dormant although the search for ways to utilize its resources continued.

Commodity consultations in 1993
International Commodity Agreements
Negotiations for the extension of the 1983 International Coffee Agreement (ICA) until 30 September 1994 were concluded successfully on 30 September 1993. The purpose was to preserve the International Coffee Organization (ICO) as a forum for cooperating on international coffee matters and to allow time for the negotiation of a new ICA. The United States of America informed the International Coffee Council that it cannot accept the further extension since there was insufficient support in the United States to remain in the Organization.
A new International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) was adopted by the International Cocoa Council to replace the 1986 ICCA which expired on 30 September 1993. The new ICCA is based on balanced development through production management and consumption expansion activities. Exporting members undertake to abide by production-management programmes designed to achieve equilibrium between production and consumption in the medium and long term. To encourage the expansion of cocoa consumption in their own countries members are to endeavour to take all practical and necessary measures and, in particular, to remove or substantially reduce obstacles to increased consumption and to identify and develop new uses for cocoa. in addition members are to have regulations to prohibit materials of non-cocoa origin from being used in place of cocoa. No buffer stock scheme influencing market prices is to be utilized and the 230 000 tonnes of cocoa in the buffer stock of the ICCO to be sold over a maximum
of four and a half years in monthly instalments, to minimize the risk of depressing market prices, starting with 51 000 tonnes in 1993/94.
The International Sugar Agreement negotiated in 1992 entered into force in January 1993. As of December 1993, 28 countries and the EC had lodged instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval or had given notice of provisional application of the new Agreement. However, the United States announced that it would not be joining. Under the new Agreement, the International Sugar Organisation (ISO) continues to provide a forum to discuss developments in the world sugar market and to provide comprehensive data on production, consumption and trade. The ISO, designated by the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) as an International Commodity Body (ICB) for the purpose of developing projects for possible CFC funding, initiated work to devise an appropriate commodity development strategy based, amongst other things, on productivity improvement, vertical diversification, increased efficiency in the use of raw materials and byproducts of sugar production, and improvements in conditions
of market access.
The International Wheat Agreement, 1986, consisting of the International Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention (FAC), came into force on 1 July 1986. The initial duration of the Wheat Trade Convention was five years while the FAC was initially to last three years but was extended for two more years in 1989. In 1993, both Conventions were further extended by another two years until 30 June 1995. The Agreement does not contain any economic provisions. The International Wheat Council continued functioning as an international forum for exchange of information on wheat and coarse grains and for administration of the FAC.
The proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Olive Oil and Table Olives held in March 1993 resulted in the adoption of a protocol extending the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives by five years from 1 January 1994. This Agreement, to which Algeria, Cyprus, the EC, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia are signatories, contains general objectives with respect to international cooperation and concerted action for the integrated development of the world economy for olive products. Under the new protocol, the resources earmarked for technical cooperation in olive cultivation, olive oil extraction and table olive processing have been doubled.
The International Jute Organisation (IJO) continued to implement research and development projects in the fields of agriculture, industry and market promotion. At the end of 1993 the Organization was carrying out seven project activities with financial assistance from members of IJO and international financing agencies.
The International Consultation on Jute and the Environment in The Hague from 26-29 October 1993 was organized by the FAO Secretariat following the recommendation of the Intergovernmental Group on Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres at its Twenty-eighth Session in October 1992. It was supported by the Commission of the European Communities and the Rockefeller Foundation of the United States of America. The Consultation was attended by representatives from all the major producing and consuming countries of jute, kenaf and allied fibres in addition to scientists, technologists, academics, representatives from industry and trade, environmental and research agencies and intergovernmental organizations, including IJO, ITC, UNCTAD and UNDP. The Consultation had detailed and wide-ranging discussions of many issues of concern to the world jute community, and identified numerous areas for follow-up activities to improve jute and kenaf's environmental attributes and strengthen the market
position of these natural fibres. In the context of newly emerging technologies for the processing of jute fibre in its diverse applications, the Consultation recommended the setting up of an International Task Force on Diverse Jute Applications, to be initially convened under the auspices of FAO. The Consultation pointed out that the sound development of the jute and kenaf economy depended not only on the resolution of technical problems affecting their products but also on the ability for all those involved in agricultural, processing, and trade activities associated with these commodities to obtain adequate financial returns.
The Second International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA II), due to expire in December 1993, was extended for one year by the International Natural Rubber Council at its meeting in late November 1993. Rubber producing and consuming countries agreed to initiate negotiations on a new price-stabilizing accord to succeed the 1987 Agreement. Importing countries agreed to renegotiate the agreement following an understanding reached with producing countries concerning a downward revision in the reference price used to guide current market intervention operations by the buffer stock manager. However, producing countries announced their intention to press for a higher price range in any new agreement. A decision to end the pact would have meant the liquidation of the INRO's buffer stocks totalling nearly 200 000 tonnes and would have exerted further downward pressure on prices which had fallen from February 1993 under the influence of weak demand and prospects of the collapse of the
Agreement.
The Council of the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) met twice during the year, in May and November. ITTO's Target 2000, with the aim that all exports of tropical timber would come from sustainably managed forest resources by the year 2000, continued to be a focus of attention. Progress towards this target was discussed, as well as how the developing countries could be assisted in their efforts to achieve the target. In addition, a number of developed countries reported progress towards similar targets but with shorter time frames, a fact that is creating considerable disagreement as well as some confusion among ITTO producer members. Producers continued to emphasize that projects such as Target 2000 are discriminatory unless they apply to timber from temperate and boreal forests in addition to tropical forests.
Trade policies received increased attention. At the May meeting the annual market discussions took as a special topic the linkages between trade and sustainable development. The report prepared for this discussion highlighted the fact that trade has little direct effect on forest management, but that trade measures can be seen as part of an overall package for encouraging sustainable forest management. It was decided to consider the subject again at the following ITTO meeting to endeavour to achieve more consensus in this complex matter. However, at the subsequent meeting, no general agreement on the issue of trade and sustainable forest management was achieved. The issue of certification and labelling of timber as a means of encouraging sustainable forest management was highlighted, and will be pursued at the next ITTO meeting.
Projects with a total cost of $23 million were approved by ITTO during the year but only $17 million was committed to fund these and previously approved projects. Of those funded 70 percent were in the area of forest management, 13 percent in that of forest industry and 20 percent in market information. Donors continued to stress that projects should be closely linked to achieving the ITTO Target 2000.
A major activity during the year was the process of negotiating a successor to the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983 (ITTA), the agreement which established ITTO. This agreement expires on 31 March 1994. Three formal negotiating sessions were held in Geneva, and in addition a number of informal discussions also took place. However, agreement on a new ITTA had not been reached by the end of 1993. The main point of disagreement between producer and consumer member countries was the scope of the ITTO. Producers insisted that the Agreement be expanded to cover all timber, while consumer members sought to retain the Organization's focus on tropical timber. Further negotiations to produce an Agreement were arranged for early in 1994.
GATT commodity councils
The International Meat Council (IMC) continued to review the Arrangement Regarding Bovine Meat. The Council and its market analysis group have dealt with policy matters of special concern to participants and are dealing increasingly with the markets for other meats. However, no progress has yet been made with regard to other objectives of the Arrangement such as the expansion and liberalization of trade.
The International Dairy Products Council and its three committees continued to review the functioning of the International Dairy Arrangement and to assess the world dairy situation. The minimum export prices set by the Council, per tonne f.o.b., remained as follows: whole milk powder $1 250; skim milk powder $1 200; certain cheeses $1 500; butter $1 350 and anhydrous milk fat (butter oil) $1 625.
FAO commodity bodies
In June 1993, the Intergovernmental Group on Rice met to discuss the short-term outlook on the world rice situation, as well as its medium and longer term prospects based on results from the projections to the year 2000. In addition, the Group reviewed: (i) measures taken by countries as an annual follow up to the Guidelines for National and International Action on Rice, and (ii) the rice policies of Cameroon and Pakistan.
The Group concluded that the volume of world rice trade in 1993 would decline and that the tendency for international prices to fall below levels in corresponding months of 1992 would be reversed late in the year reflecting growth in demand for imports. The Group considered the major issues that were likely to arise in the medium and longer term and suggested measures to expand production which included proposals for the strengthening of national and regional networks for disseminating technology. It agreed on the developing countries' need to acquire new technologies for packaging and to develop new rice products to maximise opportunities for trade with North America and Europe. Partly reflecting these views, the Group, in its capacity as an International Commodity Body of the Common Fund for Commodities, approved the submission of two project proposals to the Fund for possible financing. These focused on small scale milling and the processing of by-products. The Group's
concern over the impact that structural adjustment programmes have had on Cameroon's rice economy and on Pakistan's production and exports of rice, resulted in agreement to return to the assessment of the implications of these programmes on rice producing countries in future sessions. The Group reviewed policy measures that had adverse implications on the world market under the Guidelines for National and International Action on Rice. It regretted, in particular, the expanded use of export aids by some developed country rice exporters and recommended greater technical and financial assistance to enable developing countries to increase production and improve their storage capacity.
In May 1993, the Intergovernmental Group on Grains held its Twenty Fifth Session to discuss: the current and future situation for the international grain market; developments in the Uruguay Round of Multinational Trade Negotiations; national cereal stock policies and the implications for stock levels following trade liberalization under the Draft Final Act of the Uruguay Round; the potential implications of rapid restructuring of marketing parastatals in sub-Saharan Africa; and to decide on whether or not to request the status of an International Commodity Body (ICB) from the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). With respect to the latter, the Group requested the Director General of FAO to ask the CFC to grant ICB status to the Group and requested the secretariat to ascertain the readiness of the CFC to finance projects for crops covered by the Group.
Concerning projections for grain to the year 2000, the Group noted that production was projected to expand slightly faster than during the 1980s. The Group was further informed that growth in consumption of grains was projected to slow down in the 1990s. As regards trade, the projections showed the developed countries' imports in the year 2000 to be lower than in the late 1980s, while grain imports into the developing countries were projected to increase by one-third over the same period.
The Intergovernmental Group on Oilseeds, Oils and Fats, meeting in mid-April 1993, reviewed the short and medium-term market situation and outlook and examined policy developments. With regard to the medium-term outlook for supply, demand and trade of oils and oilmeals the Group noted that during the 1990s production growth was expected to come increasingly from improved productivity and therefore highlighted the importance of sustained research and extension efforts. On demand, the Group discussed the implications of substituting petroleum-based products with more environment-friendly oleochemicals. Regarding trade, it noted that global export earnings were anticipated to expand less rapidly than in the past, thus affecting the capacity of developing exporting countries to finance their development efforts. In view of increased competition between developing and developed exporters, the Group felt that exporting developing countries needed to strengthen their market
research and development efforts. Furthermore, it stressed that regional trade arrangements did not replace the need for an improved global trade agreement. Regarding policy developments, the Group considered that the limited progress made in 1992 towards achieving the overall objectives of the Guidelines for International Cooperation in the Oilseeds, Oils and Oilmeals Sector had been overshadowed by a growing tendency for competition in the world markets to be distorted by export aids. On trade policies, little progress had been made towards the reduction of protectionism pending the outcome of the Uruguay Round. It therefore urged countries to reach an early and balanced global trade agreement and to ensure that the impairment of the competitive position of many exporting countries arising from subsidization by other exporters was reduced.
In December 1993, the Intergovernmental Group on Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres assessed the market situation and prospects for jute, kenaf and allied fibres including competition with synthetics. It concluded that world production of jute, kenaf and allied fibres would fall in 1993/94. However, global supplies would remain adequate as a result of relatively large carryovers from the previous season as well as weak demand due to depressed economic conditions. Over-capacity in the polypropylene manufacturing industry would continue to pose a serious threat to the use of jute products despite growing awareness of the environmental advantages of natural fibres. Following a discussion of the principles and practices of informal price arrangements, reflecting the varying views of producing and consuming countries, the Group recommended that the indicative prices for jute and kenaf for 1993/94 season remain at the levels of the previous season, that is: jute at $400  $30; and
kenaf at $350  $20. The Group also considered the report of the International Consultation on Jute and the Environment which FAO organized in The Hague in October 1993, and supported the recommended follow-up activities including the setting up of an International Task Force on Diverse Jute Applications. In reviewing developments in environmental protection legislation of selected jute consuming countries, the Group recommended that FAO should continue to monitor developments in this field and act as a focal point on this subject.
In November 1992 the Sub-Group of Sisal and Henequen Producing Countries of the Intergovernmental Group on Hard Fibres, assisted by trade and industry experts from consuming countries, reviewed developments during the 1992/93 sisal season and considered prospects for the 1993/94 season. The Sub-Group expressed its satisfaction at the recovery in sisal prices which had occurred since its previous Session, but it was concerned to note that the improvement in prices was due largely to temporary shortages and that the underlying factors which depressed prices in 1992 still prevailed. The Sub-Group also expressed concern at the further contraction of the market for agricultural twines made from sisal, especially in Western Europe, noting the further decline in prices. It hoped, however, that twine prices might improve in 1993/94. In the light of the recovery in fibre prices and the prospects for improved twine prices, the Sub-Group recommended that the Intergovernmental Group on
Hard Fibres increase the indicative prices for Brazilian No 3 fibre to $510 per tonne and for East African UG fibre to $580 per tonne, both grades c.i.f. European ports, while the indicative price for sisal and henequen baler twine be increased to $17 per standard bale c.i.f. major importing countries. The Sub-Group also reviewed the progress of project proposals which had been submitted to the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) and recommended that two projects on sisal be formulated in place of the original one which had been reviewed by the CFC in 1992.
The Intergovernmental Group on Hard Fibres, in late 1993, reviewed the market situation and short term outlook for sisal, henequen, abaca and coir, including competition from synthetic and other materials. On the basis of this assessment, and considering the views of producing and consuming countries, it adopted the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Sisal and Henequen Producing Countries to increase indicative prices for fibres from Brazil and Africa and for sisal baler twine. The Group retained the indicative price range for abaca fibre although current market prices stood considerably above the ceiling. The Group also reviewed the longer-term prospects for the three major groups of hard fibres, and considered means by which their market prospects might be improved. In particular, proposals aimed at negotiating lower shipping costs were considered. Regarding project proposals submitted to the Common Fund, the Group resolved that, since two projects on coir had been
approved for financing, its full support would now be given to the remaining projects on sisal, henequen and abaca, which it decided should be finalized and resubmitted to the Fund as soon as possible.
The Intergovernmental Group on Citrus Fruit, at its Tenth Session held in October 1993, undertook an in-depth review of prospects for production, consumption, trade and prices, and identified measures which might contribute to alleviating possible surplus conditions developing over the longer term, particularly for processed citrus. These measures included the rationalization of production and the strengthening of demand through promotional programmes, particularly in high income countries and in countries where consumption levels were low. The Group continued its close monitoring of production, consumption, trade and prices, and an assessment of the world citrus economy issued as guidance to governments and market operators concerning future developments. It also carried out a comprehensive review of global trade and production policy developments. It encouraged sustained efforts towards liberalization of trade, and initiation of implementation of market-oriented production
policies. It evaluated options for generic promotion activities, which might be considered for implementation under its auspices. In the field of technical improvements, it stimulated initiatives for establishing an intercountry collaborative mechanism for the wider Mediterranean region to address issues and constraints related to rationalizing the production base of the citrus sector in line with market potential. It continued to develop projects for possible funding by the Common Fund in its role as an ICB.
The Fourth Session of the Sub-Committee on Fish Trade of the FAO Committee on Fisheries was held in October 1993. Delegates from 66 countries discussed recent developments in the international fish trade and the specific issues to be addressed to enhance the participation of developing countries in this trade. Concern was expressed about the future availability of fish supplies for international trade since current trends indicate that supplies would increase much more slowly than demand. The Sub-Committee stressed the need to promote joint ventures and investment in fisheries as well as in fish trade among developing countries and FAO was encouraged to expand its work in these areas. The importance of the activities undertaken by FAO's Global Network of Market Information and Technical Advisory Services was noted.
Discussion of fish trade impediments and criteria for fair trade in fishery products led the Sub-Committee to recommend that FAO should prepare a chapter on international trade to be included in the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries being produced by the Organization. Work on a first draft of this chapter should be completed before the end of 1994 for review and revision by the Committee on Fisheries in March 1995.
In the discussion on international trade, environment and sustainable fisheries development, the delegation of Japan proposed to hold an international conference on the theme "Sustainable contribution of fisheries to food security". The conference would discuss, inter alia, the sustainability of resources use, species utilization and international trade, and would analyze resource management methods. Japan is to organize this conference in cooperation with FAO and it is likely to be held there in May or June 1995.

Forest products
Roundwood
Mechanical wood products
Pulp and paper
Roundwood
World production of roundwood in 1992 rose by 1.5 percent from the depressed level of 1991. Most of this was fuelwood, mainly produced and consumed in developing countries where it is used for cooking and heating. There, the rapid population growth in some countries has led to such a rise in the exploitation of fuelwood resources as to cause a serious degradation of forest vegetation. Industrial roundwood, the other roundwood output, rose by 1 percent mainly because of demand growth in North America and Asia. Elsewhere demand remained static or declined.
Among the industrial roundwoods, world production of coniferous logs, the main wood used for construction in the developed countries, increased slightly in 1992. While felling expanded in North America it was depressed in many parts of Europe. In the countries of the former USSR production of industrial roundwood, mainly coniferous logs. was reported to have decreased 15 percent. The expansion in the United States was mainly due to a rise in domestic demand not exports which were affected by the ban on logs harvested on Federal forests of the Pacific Northwest. In the Spring of 1993 a new Northwest Forest Plan was announced with measures to safeguard the habitat of the northern spotted owl, designated as an endangered species. This Plan, known as Option 9, aims to reduce annual timber sales from public forests, to 2.8 million m^3, 25 percent of the annual harvest in the 1980s. In addition, the Plan will require $1 200 million to be spent over 5 years to help the region's
forest industry which has been heavily dependent on local timber. A bill was also signed to restore the export ban on logs harvested in Federal forests. Further restrictions on harvesting North American timber are possible as other threatened wildlife species are listed under the Endangered Species Act. All these restrictions are likely to have an impact on future timber supplies and prices on world markets. A study released in mid-1993 foresees a drop by mid-decade of 30 percent in the combined annual harvest from public and private forests.
Trade in coniferous industrial roundwood logs decreased 9 percent in 1992. Trade within Europe was hit by the effects of recession in these economies; in addition fewer logs were available from central Europe as stocks of the 1990 windblown timber had been sharply reduced during the previous year. Exports from countries of the former USSR were reported to have continued their steep decline despite rising demand for them in Asia. This decline was not, however, reflected in official statistics. In contrast there was expansion in exports of round pulpwood from Eastern European countries and the Baltic States to Scandinavia. Markets in the Pacific Rim were strongly affected by the reduced supply of logs from the American Pacific Northwest. Exports from the United States decreased by a further 18 percent to 15.8 million m^3, well below the peak of 21 million m^3 in 1988. This favoured exports to Asia from New Zealand, up 12 percent to 4 million m^3, and Canada, up 100 percent to
2.2 million m^3.
In 1993 log exports from the United States declined further and imports and prices in Asia for logs from alternative sources such as New Zealand and Chile, rose to unprecedented levels. In Europe trade returned to levels prior to the 1990 windblow.
Production of non-coniferous logs from the temperate zone declined slightly in 1992 to 118 million m^3. Production in Europe, was depressed as were the economies of the major consuming countries. By contrast, production in North America rose markedly due to the increased domestic demand for furniture and the whole range of interior millwork.
Trade in non-coniferous industrial roundwood increased by 7 percent in 1992. A relatively new feature appeared to be the sharp growth of exports of non-coniferous round pulpwood from Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR to Scandinavia. Exports of non-coniferous logs from France, the world's largest exporter, declined by a further 8 percent to 1.4 million m^3. Exports of hardwood logs from Germany declined to the level prior to the 1991 peak caused by the large supply of windblown timber. Exports of American hardwood logs declined, after years of sustained growth reflecting increased domestic demand. In 1993 markets continued to be depressed in Europe but in North America the relatively high level of demand contributed to price increases for logs.
Forest product
Production of tropical logs was 2 percent up in 1992 to 171 million m^3. Trade in tropical logs continued its declining trend and was 3 percent down. Imports by Japan, although rising slightly, remained at a low level and some of the imported logs were only bought to augment the low stocks. Other major consuming countries in Asia, such as the Republic of Korea decreased imports considerably. On the supply side, the State of Sabah decreased its exports by 15 percent and Sarawak by 5 percent. However, there was an upsurge of exports from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Exports from Africa went down by 5 percent continuing a steadily declining trend.
During the last part of 1992 and in 1993 supplies for export from countries in the Far East were reduced by further legislation to ban or limit exports of tropical logs. The state of Sarawak suspended log exports during the last quarter of 1992 as felling was running ahead of the reduced level set for harvesting. In January 1993 the state of Sabah imposed a ban on log exports which were later allowed after a lengthy internal discussion. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea new forestry guidelines were put in place to hold exports to the 1992 level. The Government of Myanmar decided not to renew logging concessions to foreign companies, this may result in shipments being cut to only one third of the amount in earlier years. These sudden supply constraints on log supplies, together with the anticipated reduction in supply of coniferous logs from the United States, have pushed up tropical log prices in the Far East to unprecedented levels.
World production of pulpwood increased by one percent in 1992 to 441 million m^3. In Europe production recovered slightly, mainly reflecting notable increases in Finland, Poland and France. However, elsewhere in Western Europe demand from the pulp industry was depressed as was the level of production. The further steep decline in pulpwood prices was so severe as to make thinning operations in certain areas unprofitable. In Sweden the national average price for pulpwood fell by a further 8 percent following falls in the two previous years. In contrast, in North America, pulpwood sales expanded with considerable growth of wood pulp production.
Trade in wood chips maintained its previous level in 1992. Exports from the United States grew by 6 percent including an even larger increase for hardwood chips.
Mechanical wood products
Markets for mechanical wood products, in 1992, were characterized by the notable increase in the construction sector, their major market, in North America while in countries of the former USSR there was a further sharp contraction. Housing starts in North America grew by 18 percent to reach 1.4 million units thus leading to a notable recovery in consumption of sawnwood and wood based panels. Demand was also fuelled by the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew in the southeast of the United States. In Europe the construction sector continued to decline while in Japan it remained at its previous, relatively low, level of activity.
In 1993 construction activity in North America expanded again-, housing starts were 2 percent up favouring a further expansion for mechanical wood products. Construction activity remained depressed in Europe and in Japan.
World production of coniferous sawnwood in 1992, at 36 million m^3, was 2 percent above the depressed level of 1991. Major growth took place in the United States, 4 percent up, and in Canada, 9 percent up, but to levels still well below those reached in the late 1980s. Uncertainty about coniferous timber supplies from the Pacific Northwest of the United States drove up the prices of logs during the last quarter of 1992. This led to higher prices for processed products such as coniferous sawnwood. European countries, in general, suffered from depressed domestic markets and output recovered only slightly from the low 1991 level. However, a marked increase in output and exports occurred in the Scandinavian countries. By contrast, production in countries of the former USSR was reported to have fallen by 23 percent. In Japan output continued to decline for the third consecutive year. Increased production was recorded in New Zealand and Chile, reflecting growing exports to the
buoyant markets of the Far East.
Trade in coniferous sawnwood increased by 9 percent in 1992 to 80 million m^3 recovering from the severe declines in 1990 and 1991. Canada benefited from the high demand in the United States and its exports there increased strongly, despite a 6.5 percent duty imposed by the United States. In Europe exports from the Scandinavian countries continued to expand, by 19 percent for Sweden and by 8 percent for Finland. Scandinavian exports were boosted by their increased competitiveness following the devaluation of their currencies and by the further fall in exports from countries of the former USSR, 35 percent down.
In 1993 demand for coniferous sawnwood remained relatively high in North America and prices escalated to unprecedented levels. Canada's exports, mainly to the United States, grew by a further 3 percent. In Europe, exports from Scandinavian countries continued their strong growth at rising prices. Exports from countries of the former USSR. constrained by production problems, were forecast to fall by a further 28 percent. North American shippers decreased their exports to Europe because of an EC phytosanitary regulation enacted to avoid importing pine nematode on American green lumber. Its impact on the industry in North America was offset by growth in its other markets and by higher prices. Competition for markets in Europe increased with the effects of the 1992 devaluation of Swedish and Finnish currencies, in addition supplies of substitute material from countries in economic transition further disturbed the market. This situation gave rise to a request by some EC member
countries for the volume and prices of exports of coniferous sawnwood from Finland and Sweden to the EC to be monitored for three months within the framework of EC procedures.
World production of non-coniferous sawnwood from the temperate zone increased slightly in 1992 to some 60 million m^3, recovering part of the decline of 1991. As for many other wood products, markets expanded in North America but were depressed in Western Europe including weakened demand for its furniture. Further. competition from Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) increased. Production in France declined 6 percent to 3.8 million m^3 in 1992. Romania and the former Yugoslavia, previously two major European producers, maintained output at levels well below those achieved in the 1980s. Production in the United States rose 10 percent.
Trade in non-coniferous sawnwood from the temperate zone grew by 10 percent to 6.5 million m^3 in 1992. Exports from North America continued to grow with those of the United States 5 percent up and Canada up by 13 percent. Prices rose well above those in previous years fuelled by uncertainty about future supplies of both temperate and tropical timber. Exports from both France and Germany decreased further, penalised by the strength of their currencies. These decreases were partly offset by a notable upsurge of exports from Eastern European countries. The same market situation continued in 1993 with further growth in North America and some signs of recovery in the United Kingdom and in Germany.
Production of tropical sawnwood was down by 1.5 percent to 69 million m^3 in 1992. This reflected the policy of major producing countries to favour the expansion of its transformation in their own plywood and veneer industries.
Trade in tropical sawnwood grew by 8 percent in 1992, despite depressed demand in Europe and Japan, and measures introduced in Europe to limit its use. Demand growth in countries of the Pacific Rim, notably China and Thailand, and in some Near East states, offset contraction in other markets. Exports from Malaysia, already the largest in the world, were up by 10 percent and amounted to 5.4 million m^3. The states of Sabah and Sarawak increased their sawnwood exports by 9 and 55 percent respectively by diversion of logs from export to domestic sawmills. Peninsular Malaysia, whose export policy also favours further processed products. maintained its previous level of exports at 2.1 million m^3. Africa's exports recovered from the low level of 1991 and grew by 10 percent.
In 1993 trade in tropical sawnwood continued to grow, but mainly in the Pacific area. Uncertainty about future timber Supplies, both temperate and tropical, led some Asian countries to increase stocks of tropical sawnwood and prices rose sharply.
World production of plywood grew by 3 percent in 1992 to 48 million m^3. The increase in plywood output was mainly clue to recovery in North American markets from the depressed level of 1991. There plywood represents the largest component of wood based panels, some 52 percent of total consumption. Output was, however, still well below that of the late 1980s. In Europe and in the countries of the former USSR, production declined for the third consecutive year. By contrast, in the Far East production of tropical plywood grew strongly reflecting increases in both domestic consumption and exports. Growth of output in Indonesia, the world's largest producer of tropical plywood, was 5 percent and in Malaysia, 25 percent.
Trade in plywood in 1992 rose 3 percent above the depressed level of 1991 to 16 million m^3. There was a notable upsurge of trade in North America and the Far East. Exports of plywood, mainly softwood, from the United States grew by 14 percent to reach 1.6 million m^3 and from Canada by over 30 percent to 0.4 million m^3. These exports went to the EC, Asia and Mexico. Very little plywood is traded between the United States and Canada because of differences in product standards. Exports of tropical plywood from Indonesia grew further by 5 percent to 8.6 million m^3, more than 50 percent of total world trade; main markets were: Japan, the United States and developing countries of the Far East. In 1993 there was a notable expansion of consumption, production and trade in the Far East and North America and prices rose considerably.
World production of particleboard in 1992 maintained its previous level of 48 million m^3. Production in North America grew strongly reflecting increased activity in housing and, following hurricane Andrew, in the repair and remodelling sector. Oriented Strand Board (OSB), a relatively new panel product mainly produced in North America, gained an increased share of the structural panel market. In Europe, the largest producer of regular particleboard, production and consumption declined for the third consecutive year reflecting the depressed state of the housing and furniture sectors.
Total trade in particleboard increased by 7 percent in 1992 mainly as a result of strong growth of trade in OSB between Canada and the United States. In 1993, a slight recovery in Europe reflected modest increases in consumption in the United Kingdom and Germany.
World production of fibreboard in 1992 remained at 20 million m^3. The long established products, fibreboard, hardboard and insulating board, continued to cede market share to Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). Growth in MDF production strengthened in Europe and in North America. Output in Europe in 1992 was ten times that of 1982. Rapid expansion of MDF production capacity continues as does the number of its uses in the furniture. joinery and construction sector. Trade in MDF, although still relatively small, increased.
<title>Commodity review and outlook 1993-94</title>
<section>1</section>
Pulp and paper
World production of paper and paperboard in 1992 increased by one percent to a new record of 246 million tonnes. However, the rate of growth though the same as the previous year, was still well below that of the late 1980s. Strong growth was particularly notable in the developing countries of the Far East including Indonesia, China, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, as in previous years. In the United States production grew by 3.3 percent to a record 75 million tonnes but in Canada there was no growth. In Western Europe production rose by 2.5 percent where the most notable expansion was in coated graphic paper. In Eastern Europe, with the exception of Poland, production stagnated and in countries of the former USSR output was down by a further 24 percent.
Trade in paper and paperboard grew by 5 percent to 62 million tonnes. Import growth was especially strong in the Far East. Imports by China rose 57 percent to 2.9 million tonnes and those of Hong Kong by 19 percent to 2.3 million tonnes. There was a notable expansion of exports from the United States, mainly to the Far East and Central America; its total exports rose by 7 percent including 38 percent growth for newsprint. Canada's exports, the world's largest, grew by a further 4 percent. Trade in Western Europe continued to grow with notable increases in graphic and household paper. Exports from Finland and Sweden grew notably, helped by the devaluation of their currencies. Despite the continuation of growth in production and trade, the paper industry continued to be affected by excess capacity and relatively low prices and profitability. In 1993 paper production and trade continued to grow markedly in North America and in the developing countries of the Far East. In
Western Europe demand growth slowed and production only increased slightly.
The global level of wood pulp production declined in 1992 even though paper output increased slightly. In Western Europe in 1992 was the third consecutive year of decline, reflecting displacement of wood pulp by waste paper and non-fibre raw materials such as fillers and coatings. There recovery of waste paper is often enforced by legislative measures to increase the recycling of waste material. As a result, consumption of recycled fibres in Western Europe exceeded consumption of chemical pulps for the first time in 1992. In the United States the pulp industry expanded with growth in domestic and export markets reflecting growth in paper production. Production also expanded considerably in Chile and in Brazil where most of the additional supplies were exported. However, in Canada there was no growth.
Trade in wood pulp increased by 3 percent and amounted to 28 million tonnes in 1992. Many markets tended to have excessive supplies of "market pulp" which depressed prices. Some pulp prices fell by close to 50 percent below their high point in 1989. With the reduced prices, notable purchases for stock were made by the main consuming countries in the Far East and Western Europe despite depressed demand for the end products. In 1993 consumption was at a relatively high level in the Far East and North America but international markets continued to be affected by excessive supplies of wood pulp and falling prices.
The Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) Harmonized System (HS) and Forest Products Trade Statistics
For most forest products changes from the earlier CCCN and SITC Rev.2 to the Harmonized System (HS) were minor. However, in the case of industrial roundwood, wood in the rough, subdivisions based on the use to which roundwood was put, were discontinued. Consequently, the basic classification no longer distinguishes between sawlogs and veneer logs, pulpwood and other industrial roundwood.
The attempt to estimate data according to the old subdivisions has been discontinued and from 1990 onwards trade in industrial roundwood will be reported in three categories, namely: coniferous; non-coniferous of tropical country origin; and non-coniferous from other countries. This change has been implemented in the appended tables of summary data although it has not been possible to provide data prior to 1990.
External trade of the European Community (EC)
The effect on trade data for forest products of excluding trade between members of the EC is illustrated for 1991 in the table below. This is to anticipate the likely impact on these data of the unification of the EC market from the beginning of 1993. Thereafter the only border for the collection of import and export statistics will be that crossed by goods entering or leaving the Community as a whole. The consequent exclusion from aggregate data of trade between member states, the intratrade, will be reflected in reduced figures for EC trade, treating it as a single country, with effects on global aggregates illustrated in the table.

Output sharply down in 1992/93
Production in 1992/93 was 5.51 million tonnes, the lowest since 1988/89. A sharp reduction in the Brazilian crop, to 1.44 million tonnes, was the principal reason for the drop. The crop suffered from the eradication of 800 million trees, some 23 percent of the previous total, and from unfavourable weather. Production also fell in the remainder of Latin America, especially in Colombia following the record crop of the previous year, and in Africa. Though cyclic and weather phenomena played their part, the major reason for the decline was that prices remained insufficient to cover the full cost of production thus reducing the scope for tree replacement and renovation. Of late, prices were also below the variable cost of production and undermined the level of husbandry. Only for the low cost producers of Asia did prices remain sufficient to support adequate husbandry. There, robusta production approached the feasible maximum reflecting the lower costs and young trees in these
countries.
Prices and stocks of coffee
Exports moderately lower in 1993
Preliminary indications suggest a reduction of between 3 and 4 percent in 1993 export volumes. Exports during the first nine months of 1993 were 3.4 million tonnes, compared to 3.5 million tonnes in the same period of the previous year. Brazilian shipments continued to decline and Colombian shipments were 6 percent less than the record of the previous year. Contraction in exports from these countries, being mainly in arabica coffee, reduced global shipments of this type. By contrast, shipments of robusta increased during the first part of 1993.
Slight recovery in exports in 1992
Data for 1992 show exports (including re-exports) of coffee beans to have increased by 2 percent to 4.69 million tonnes. Shipments from Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 4 percent and those from Africa slightly. Shipments from Asia and Oceania, however, declined by 5 percent. Colombia was a major contributor with the exports up by 26 percent, a rise of 190 000 tonnes. By contrast, Brazil's shipments fell by 7 percent from the previous year with the short crop in 1992/93 and the low level of privately owned stocks contributing to the decline. Aggregate exports by the rest of Latin America fell slightly though Guatemala regained the levels of 1989 and 1990.
Trade from Africa and Asia remained sluggish. A 29 percent reduction in exports from Indonesia outweighed the 60 percent increase in exports by Viet Nam and the doubling of those from Thailand. Shipments by India and Papua New Guinea, were only slightly greater than in 1991.
Consumption stagnant in 1992
Consumption in recent years has been bolstered by reduced retail prices in real terms, that is allowing for inflation. The decline in real prices has favoured increased consumption despite sluggish income growth, especially among those sections of the population whose consumption was far below saturation. On average, the effect of a decrease of 10 percent in retail prices would be a 3 percent expansion in consumption. These considerations largely account for the 4 percent increase in the European Community's consumption in. 1992 and a somewhat lesser increase elsewhere in western Europe. Similar increases had already occurred in the United States between 1989 and 1991. However, the longer-term downward trend in coffee consumption there was evident in the 5 percent contraction in 1992, shown in the latest available data. This, and the 11 percent decline in Japan, outweighed increases elsewhere so global consumption contracted slightly. However, production fell to its lowest
level since 1988/89 and global stocks decreased slightly.
Moderate recovery in output forecast for 1993/94
World coffee output was expected to rise by 6 percent to 5.83 million tonnes in 1993/94. The major contributor to increased production was Brazil following more favourable weather and the greater maturity and crop potential of some high-yielding trees. However, these positive factors were partly counteracted by a lack of fertiliser application resulting in smaller cherries and lower net yields.
Output in Colombia continued to decline following the record year of 1991/92. Though 1993/94 is the positive year of the biennial cycle, production was expected to be curtailed following the spread of broca, a pest that damages coffee cherries. In addition, the use of fertilisers in 1992/93 was only about half the 1990/91 level. Other losses stemmed from the eradication of trees on about 30 000 hectares of marginal land in addition to the eradication of the previous year. Output in the remainder of Latin America and the Caribbean was expected to be similar to 1992/93, at 1.27 million tonnes. The benefit of the positive year of the biennial cycle in many countries was moderated by severe cuts in the application of fertilisers and control chemicals. As a result, output from high-yielding varieties, which is strongly geared to fertiliser application and has formed an increasing proportion of regional output, has been reduced substantially.
Output in Africa was expected to recover slightly to reach 1.05 million tonnes, still some 13 percent below the average for 1988-90. Production in Cte d'Ivoire, the largest producer in Africa, should recover from the disappointing 1992/93 crop following adequate rainfall and with additional production from trees that have been severely pruned. However, the recovery could be moderated by the effect of the depressed price of robusta coffee, which has led to a decrease in the standard of husbandry in Cte d'Ivoire and other robusta producing countries. In addition, the cultivation of coffee is increasingly being replaced by the production of food crops for local sale in areas adjacent to urban centres. Arabica crops in Africa have also been affected by the decline in prices. These have also suffered from the ageing of trees and, sometimes, the deterioration of the processing and marketing infrastructure. Production in both Ethiopia and Kenya, the largest producers of arabica
in the region, was expected to be essentially the same in 1993/94 as in 1992/93.
Though producers in Asia and Oceania have not been immune to the decline in prices, their comparatively low cost of production, and the larger proportion of younger, more vigorous, trees have underpinned production levels. Output in Indonesia, the region's largest producer, is expected to be maintained in 1993/94. However, there has been some change to the composition of output following the replacement of robusta by arabica in suitable areas. Production in Vietnam, a relatively new major producer, continues to increase, and in India the biennial cycle is expected to lead to a substantially higher crop.
Retention scheme would swell producers' stocks
Producers' stocks, which reached 2.88 million tonnes during 1989, would be expected to fall to 2.21 million tonnes in 1993 and on current trends to just over 2 million tonnes at the end of marketing year 1994. However, envisaged retentions, at up to 20 percent of exports for most producers, could add considerably to producer stocks in 1994. As a result, producers' stocks may be somewhat higher than 2 million tonnes. A build-up of stocks in importing countries has occurred as imports have exceeded consumption. Consumers' stocks, at 1.1 million tonnes at the end of 1992, were equivalent to over three months cover for consumption and over twice the size of normal requirements. Preliminary data suggest that there has only been a small decrease in 1993 but the retention scheme adopted by producers, if effective, should lead to a greater decrease in consumers' stocks during 1994.
The two largest producing stockholders, Brazil and Colombia, have experienced substantial falls in stocks. For Brazil, a succession of short crops has resulted in stocks falling by over one-third and currently they are mainly composed of publicly owned stocks, some in poor condition, which cannot be freely exported. Buoyant trade by Colombia, especially increased shipments to the European Community, has resulted in a reduction of 40 percent in holdings. There have also been reductions elsewhere removing most of the stocks in excess of commercial requirements.
Prices still depressed despite increases in 1993
The ICO composite indicator price recovered by nearly 17 percent during 1993. Fundamental issues of supply and demand provided some underpinning but most of the impetus came from cautious optimism about the success of the producer retention scheme. Nevertheless, pessimistic factors, including the failure of ICA negotiations and the decision by the United States to leave the Agreement, restricted the upward movement. The ICO composite indicator price at about 69 US cents per pound in November 1993 was 26 percent below the average of 1988-90.
Export earnings plunged to $7 240 million in 1992, less than three quarters of average earnings between 1988 and 1990 and $1 000 million less than in 1991. Price increases in 1993 would more than compensate for reduced export volumes and export earnings should be moderately greater.
Coffee Exporters' Retention Scheme
The failure of negotiations for a new ICA persuaded producers that their interests would best be served by adopting an export retention scheme. The intention is that producing countries will withhold an amount of coffee equivalent to 20 percent of their exports until prices reach 75 cents/lb. If prices exceed this level but are below 85 cents/lb, 10 percent will be withheld. The scheme met with early problems on its implementation towards the end of 1993. The most serious initial problem was the inability of the Brazilian authorities to purchase sufficient coffee for the purposes of retention. If these problems can be overcome, then prices should rise in 1994 though producer receipts will be affected by contraction in the volume of exports and the cost of purchasing coffee for stockholding. The price target of producers, when formulating their retention scheme, was an increase of some 20 US cents per pound in the world price of coffee. An increase in world prices of that
size would tend to increase retail prices by around 10 percent and reduce consumption by about 3 percent, though there would be some differences between countries in response to higher prices.

Cocoa
Large deficit expected in 1993/94
World cocoa production in 1993/94 was forecast to fall to 2.3 million tonnes of raw beans, nearly 3 percent less than in the previous year. However, preliminary indications are that grindings in 1993/94 will be some 2 percent above the 1992/93 level and should approach 2.5 million tonnes. Thus there is a prospective deficit in supplies for the third consecutive year. This deficit, of over 200 000 tonnes, is the largest since 1988/89.
The 100 000 tonne output decline in Africa was not likely to be offset by increases in Latin America and the Far East. In Cte d'Ivoire, there was a low yield of pods from the main crop, following tree stress from the unusually high mid crop of the previous season. The crop was expected to amount to 650 000 tonnes, some 50 000 tonnes less than the previous season and 150 000 tonnes less than the average of 1988-90. A larger decline was expected in Ghana, again because of tree stress. The crop was expected to be 60 000 tonnes down, a reduction of almost 20 percent from the previous year. Pod development was satisfactory in Nigeria but a sharp reduction in the use of fungicides has led to an increase in the incidence of black pod disease, which may reduce the main crop significantly. Though production was forecast to increase slightly in Cameroon, the increase will be restricted by disease following a lack of application of fungicides.
In Latin America, dry weather inhibited both black pod and witches' broom disease in Brazil but also prevented fruit from setting early in the season, though some recovery was evident at a later stage. The net effect pointed to a small increase in the crop. In Asia, the recent growth in output by Indonesia was forecast to continue. This followed a substantial expansion in the area under bearing trees with the number of young trees buttressing production for some time. Some losses have occurred from the depredations of the cocoa pod borer but these have been contained. In Malaysia depressed world prices resulted in a small decrease in the area planted, a reduction in husbandry and less control of the cocoa pod borer. As a result, and despite reasonably favourable weather, output was expected to fall slightly.
Cocoa: production, grindings and prices
In 1992/93 production had recovered
Global production in 1992/93 recovered to 2 335 000 tonnes, 3 percent higher than in the previous year. This principally reflected very favourable weather in Ghana, where the crop was 28 percent up and a further increase in the number of bearing trees in Indonesia. Elsewhere, small increases in Latin American harvests were overshadowed by another and substantial decline in Cte d'Ivoire. To some extent, this reflected the decision by the authorities to Close Purchases by 30 April 1993 and as a result some of the mid crop remained in the hands of growers. This, may be added to sales of the 1993/94 crop. However, as there was some deterioration during storage, the quality of some 1993/94 sales may suffer.
Slow growth in grindings and consumption forecast for 1993/94
Preliminary indications are that grindings in 1993/94 will be some 2 percent above the 1992/93 level and should approach 2.5 million tonnes. Growth in Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR should continue its previous recovery without, however, returning to the levels of 1988-90. Slower than average growth was expected in western Europe though there were prospects for a notable expansion in product exports. Improved economic prospects in the United States were expected to lead to a 3 percent increase in grindings. In the developing countries, increased consumption in Indonesia and Malaysia and some increase in the sale of processed cocoa by Malaysia to China were expected to result in an increase of 5 percent in grindings in the Far East.
In 1992/93 grindings grew 4.6 percent
Grindings, in product weight, some 99 percent of raw beans, were 2.415 million tonnes in 1992/93, 4.5 percent greater than the previous year. The major increases were confined to USSR. In countries of the former USSR, grindings recovered sharply to 85 000 tonnes following the slump in 1991/92. Nevertheless, they were still 60 000 tonnes less than the average of 1988-90 but much of the decline was offset by imports of chocolate from western Europe. The European Community (EC) exported over 29 000 tonnes of chocolate to countries of the former USSR in 1992. This compares with under 3 000 tonnes in 1991 and 570 tonnes in 1990. Grindings in the United States increased by 16 percent, largely at the expense of previous imports of processed cocoa, particularly products from Brazil. Grindings fell slightly in the developing countries.
Trade in cocoa beans stagnant in 1992
Exports of cocoa beans declined 3 percent in 1992 to a little above the average for 1988-90. Exports from Africa fell by 9 percent with substantially reduced shipments by Cte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. This shortfall was partly compensated by record exports from Indonesia which was the largest supplier of cocoa beans to the United States in 1992. The principal decrease in imports was by countries of the former USSR. Their imports were only half those for the previous year and 30 percent of the 1988-90 average. Availability of foreign exchange had been a major constraint for the formerly centrally planned economies but this had been eased in Eastern Europe by the domestic operations of processors with headquarters in western Europe.
The unit value for exports of beans remained unchanged at $1.07/kg. This was about one-quarter less than the average of 1988-90 and $0.52/kg less than the recent peak of 1988. The value of all cocoa exports, including products, remained virtually unchanged at almost $3.8 million. However, there was a 3 percent fall in the value of exports by the developing countries. This reflects some slackness in the export trade in cocoa products, both in volume
Some recovery In prices in 1993
Prices, which fell substantially during the first six months of 1993, recovered in the third quarter of 1993 with the ICCO indicator price rising above SDR 1000/tonne, for the first time since July 1990, to regain the average level in 1988-90. The recovery was principally based on the reaction of the market to the deficit forecast for 1993/94.
Improving price outlook for 1994
Upward pressure on prices was expected in 1994 as a result of both fundamental and expectational factors. In fundamental terms, consumption was expected to continue to exceed production reducing world stocks from their level of 1.4 million tonnes at the end of September 1993. The expected deficit of 0.2 million tonnes in 1993/94 would reduce stocks to 1.2 million tonnes by the end of the crop year. This, similar to the average for 1988-90, will represent about half a year's consumption compared to over two-thirds in 1991/92.
Upward pressure on prices would remain while these expectations hold sway in the trade. Furthermore, there was a successful conclusion to the negotiations for a new Cocoa Agreement, now based on export quotas and consumption promotion rather than on buffer stocks. However, there will be some delay to implementation as attempts to obtain the accession of two important producing countries, Indonesia and Malaysia, continue. As Indonesia is a major supplier to the United States, which is not a member of the Cocoa Agreement, the absence of both countries might prove to be a problem when setting quotas. However, if the Agreement becomes operational then, despite the absence from membership of the United States and the possible absence of Indonesia, it should be possible for prices to be maintained above the floor level set under the Agreement. Nevertheless stocks, though declining, are still considerable and will tend to moderate price increases. So too will the decision to
liquidate ICCO buffer stocks.

Tea
Substantial recovery in 1993 production anticipated
Preliminary indications of harvests during the first half of 1993 suggested that world tea production would recover from the very low level of the previous year. First estimates for the 1993 crop indicate a total output of around 2 540 000 tonnes with about 54 percent CTC and 46 percent orthodox teas. Substantial increases in harvests were expected in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and all other producing countries in East Africa.
Production dropped significantly in 1992
In 1992 global production of tea fell below the 1991 record crop by over 9 percent, with large crop reductions in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Malawi and more moderate declines in some other East African countries and in China. In all cases the crop losses were caused by extreme drought conditions during the early part of the year. In India output declined by 9 percent from the 1991 level. The decrease mainly reflected the smaller crop in South India, which was 15 percent below the previous year, at 157 000 tonnes. The tea harvest in North India also fell by some I 1 000 tonnes. In Sri Lanka, production was 25 percent lower than in 1991, at 179 000 tonnes. The only countries to report an increase in output for 1992 were Indonesia with a rise of about 2 percent and Bangladesh, where the tea harvest was up by 7 percent from the previous year's level. The increase was mainly due to new plantings coming into production.
Import demand and trade also down in 1992
Global exports of tea fell by 9 percent to 1 014 000 tonnes in 1992. The main reasons for this were a decline in import demand, particularly by the former USSR and Iraq. The volume of tea imported by the former USSR fell from a record level of 231 000 tonnes in 1990 to only 73 000 tonnes in 1992. Factors causing this decrease were a shortage of foreign exchange, high inflation and a further weakening of the rouble. Shipments to Eastern Europe recovered from the low levels of 1991 mainly due to a 50 percent increase of imports by Poland. Purchases by the United Kingdom fell slightly following much reduced imports from Kenya and Malawi, which were not fully offset by the larger shipments from India and Indonesia and the lower re-exports. Imports into the United States rose by 8 percent, reaching a level close to the 1988 record.
Tea imports by developing countries were estimated to have increased slightly in 1992. Larger imports by Chile, Saudi Arabia, Syria and particularly Pakistan, were only partly offset by lower shipments to Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sudan. Reported imports into Iraq amounted to only 1 600 tonnes, compared to a 46 000 tonnes average in the 1987-89 period, reflecting the United Nations trade embargo.
The contraction in exports in 1992, most notably affected India and Sri Lanka. Exports from India declined to only 173 000 tonnes following the drop in output and higher domestic consumption, which has grown faster than production in recent years. Sri Lanka's exports also declined, by 16 percent, to 178 000 tonnes. The sharp decrease was the consequence of the complete collapse of exports to Iraq and reduced shipments to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Egypt, which were not offset by the higher sales to Syria and Germany. Exports from Sri Lanka to the former USSR virtually hatted, and shipments of value added teas declined considerably. Packeted tea exports declined by 21 percent to around 55 000 tonnes, while shipments of tea bags and instant tea remained almost constant. By contrast, exports from Bangladesh and Indonesia increased in 1992, with Indonesia's shipments up by 10 percent from the previous year. Exports from
Kenya, at 166 000 tonnes, were 5 percent below their 1991 record level reflecting the substantial decline in production. Exports from other African countries remained unchanged in total. In South America, shipments from both Argentina and Brazil rose moderately.
Recovery in 1903
The global level of trade was expected to recover significantly in 1993 to judge from early data. While Indian Government estimates for 1993 pointed to export availabilities of well above 200 000 tonnes, it will be difficult to achieve this figure considering that production will most likely remain below the 1991 peak while growth in domestic consumption is again likely to outpace growth in production. Under these circumstances, exports of tea from India in 1993 seemed unlikely to surpass 200 000 tonnes. Exports from Sri Lanka up to the end of July 1993, at 117 000 tonnes, were 16 percent above those in the comparable period of 1992. The sharp increase was the consequence of a complete recovery in production after the drought losses in 1992, much larger purchases by the United Arab Emirates and Syria and a strong return to Sri Lanka of buyers from the former USSR. These increases were only partly offset by smaller sales to Egypt and the Islamic Republic of Iran. A
continuation of these trends throughout the year implied a return of Sri Lanka's exports to the range of 200 000 to 210 000 tonnes. Exports from Bangladesh and Indonesia during the first half of 1993 were also notably higher than in the first six months of 1992.
Production and consumption changes and the London tea prices
In East Africa, exports from Kenya during the first seven months of the year were about 4 percent above the level of the same period in 1992 and the year's outcome could equal the 1991 record reflecting the larger crop. Sales from other East African tea producers were expected to remain largely unchanged.
Latest import figures for the major market of the United Kingdom indicated a significant increase during the first seven months of 1993 reflecting the reversal of a prolonged decline in consumption supported by the introduction of specially flavoured teas. Elsewhere in the EC there were no notable changes. There are no official data available on imports by the countries of the former USSR, however data from some major exporting countries indicate that shipments to this area will increase significantly in 1993. By contrast, purchases by the United States from January to July 1993 declined by almost 15 percent. Among developing countries, it would appear that purchases by Pakistan are likely to continue their upward trend.
Price outlook remains uncertain
The sizeable increase in purchases by the countries of the former USSR, higher imports by the United Arab Emirates and by the United Kingdom stimulated a pickup in tea prices in 1993, despite the increased crop. The average level of auction prices, expressed in US dollars, increased in all auction centres except London and Mombasa, where prices had boomed temporarily in the early months of the previous year due to an exceptional crop shortfall. Expressed in national currencies the price increases were larger reflecting a decline in their rates of exchange relative to the US dollar in 1993. It was difficult to assess the impact of the larger 1993 crop on future price developments, but there were reasons for prices to remain above the depressed levels of 1992. In particular, low stocks were reported for both exporting and importing countries. In addition, there was the potential for increased import demand from the former USSR and a return of Iraq to the market.

Sugar
Production forecast to recover in 1993/94
World production of centrifugal sugar was forecast to rise 1.9 percent to 113 million tonnes in 1993/94, recovering from a 3 percent fall in the previous year. Cane sugar production was expected to increase by 1.7 percent to 74 million tonnes and beet sugar remained virtually unchanged at 39 million tonnes. The increase would reflect recovery in output in India, Indonesia and Thailand, and better crops in Pakistan, Ukraine, the Russia Federation, Poland and in Cuba, after the disastrous crop there in 1992/93. Part of the increase in these countries would be offset by declines in the EC, Australia and South Africa.
Sugar: World prices
In India production would increase following the implementation of Government measures to improve the financial condition of the mills. Thailand's increase would be from the sharply reduced output in 1992/93 and Poland's would reflect greatly expanded area and favourable weather. By contrast and even with favourable weather, EC output was likely to decline mainly due to contraction in the area sown. In Australia drought during the growing season was likely to reduce output, while South Africa's further decline would be due to the previous year's serious drought.
Contraction in 1992/93 the first since 1986/87
In 1992/93 world sugar production declined by 3 percent to 112 million tonnes, the first contraction in six years. Global cane sugar output fell by some 5 million tonnes to 73 million tonnes, while output of beet sugar increased by one million tonnes to 39 million tonnes. The decline in cane sugar was due to a sharp fall in output mainly in Cuba, India, Thailand and South Africa. Higher beet sugar production reflected an increase in the EC.
Consumption forecast to Increase in 1994
World sugar consumption was forecast to rise by 1.5 percent to 114 million tonnes in 1994, the same rate of increase as in 1993. Consumption was expected to increase in the developing countries particularly in the highly populated ones such as Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Pakistan. Among the developed countries, consumption was projected to increase in the United States, reflecting a slight rise in per caput consumption and higher industrial requirements as the economy expands. A small increase was also likely in the EC. However, outside the EC overall demand in western Europe would remain stable, while in eastern European countries demand might decline further due to increased domestic sugar prices and economic difficulties.
Carryover stocks forecast to decline further in 1993/94
World carryover stocks of sugar, which had declined by 1.8 million tonnes to 37.5 million tonnes by 31 August 1993, were expected to decline by a further one million tonnes during 1993/94. The stock/consumption ratio in 1993/94 could fall to 30 percent against 35 percent two years ago. The greatest reduction in stocks would occur in India and in China, where considerable surpluses had accumulated. In general, exportable supplies should be adequate as import demand was forecast to decline. However, the crucial question was the adequacy of these stocks to cushion any major and unforeseen shortfalls in production.
World sugar trade had recovered in 1992
In 1992 world trade in centrifugal sugar recovered to 31 million tonnes. The increase reflected enlarged exports from the developing countries, mainly Thailand, India and the Republic of Korea. These increases were partly offset by less from developed countries, such as Australia and South Africa. The main increases in imports were in Africa and in the countries of the former USSR.
In contrast trade declined in 1993
In 1993, world sugar imports were forecast to decline by 4 percent to 30 million tonnes. Among the major importing countries, the United States was expected to have reduced import requirements owing to ample domestic supplies. Imports by the countries of the former USSR were likely to decline due to scarcity of foreign exchange, falling incomes and the phasing out of subsidies. Imports into the eastern European countries would also decline due to economic difficulties. By contrast, Argentina and Mexico would import larger quantities and India and China might also become net importers, due in every case to reduced levels of production.
Preliminary data for exports during the first nine months of 1993 indicated that of the major exporting countries, only Thailand and Brazil would ship more than during the corresponding period in 1992. The expansion in Thailand and Brazil reflected increased availability.
Export earnings forecast to decline in 1993
Export earnings from sugar remained unchanged at $10 600 million in 1992 despite the increased volume. Earnings were unlikely to rise in 1993, as the effect of a slight rise in prices was likely to be offset by reduced volumes. By mid-May 1993, world sugar prices had reached their peak for the year following a substantial downward revision in estimates of 1992/93 output in Cuba and Thailand, two of the main exporting countries. Prices then moved down with increased output in Australia and Brazil and no notable expansion in import demand. In the year 1993, the International Sugar Agreement (ISA) daily price averaged US cents 10 per lb, 11 percent higher than during 1992.

Bananas
Exports maintained at over 10 million tonnes in 1992
World banana exports remained above 10 million tonnes in 1992 but were 2 percent below the record trade of 1991. Shipments from Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporting country, decreased 5 percent to 2.15 million tonnes. Nevertheless, this outcome was still 41 percent greater than the average of 1988-90 and represented over 25 percent of world banana trade in 192. The Union of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) increased exports by one percent and increased its market share to almost 50 percent. Expansion of planting provided Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala with considerably increased supplies for export, more than offsetting reduced crops in Honduras and Nicaragua. These latter countries suffered from adverse weather conditions, when cyclones reduced crops in a number of plantations. Increases were also recorded in several African and Caribbean (ACP) countries. In the Caribbean, exports rose 17 percent in 1992 with larger shipments from Jamaica,
Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and Grenadines more than offsetting the slight drop in volume from Grenada. The increase in exports from Africa, 11 percent, was mainly from Cte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This more than offset the virtual collapse of exports from Somalia due to civil war. In the Far East, exports decreased by 15 percent mainly reflecting a decline in the Philippines, following an exceptional performance in 1991.
Source of growth in world banana imports: change between 1989-91 and 1990-92
Imports continued to grow In 1992
Much of the increase in imports was due to a 10 percent increase in consumption in the United States stimulated by a decline in average import prices of 15 percent and in retail prices of 5 percent. In the United Kingdom, average retail prices fell by 11 percent and imports rose by 11 percent through import prices remained virtually unchanged.
The 55 000 tonnes increase accounted for over 40 percent of the additional imports made by the EC. Consumers in France and Germany also benefited from lower prices but although imports increased the response was less pronounced than in the United Kingdom.
Consumption in France was static and previous growth in Germany, bolstered by re-unification and product promotion, was not sustained. In Eastern Europe, the available data for Bulgaria and Hungary showed a considerable increase in imports. In contrast, imports by the developing countries fell by 9 percent, mainly reflecting a large reduction in imports by the Republic of Korea, following the surge after the lifting of quotas in 1991.
Divergent trends in trade during 1993
Preliminary indications are that exports in 1993 might have declined relative to 1992. However, export availabilities could be one million tonnes in excess ion import requirements, and the outcome would be considerably influenced by the EC banana import regime applied from July 1993 (see Box). Import prices, before payment of duty, for a number of EC countries appear to have declined since July 1993 but it is too soon to analyze the effects of the new regime.
World banana imports in 1993 were expected to be about 19 million tonnes, reflecting a small growth in purchases due to decreased retail prices that have spurred consumption in the developed countries, which account for about 90 percent of imports. Bananas have also benefited from the shift to more healthy diets. However, due to an expansion of the area planted in anticipation of new market opportunities, exportable supplies are expected to exceed forecast imports considerably. Greater consumption stimulated by reduced market prices particularly in import markets with relatively low per caput consumption, may help towards reducing the global surplus. By contrast, there appears to be little scope in the EC for a sizeable increase in consumption. The main constraints were price rises to consumers in some countries following the imposition of additional duties and the reduction of the import quantities from Latin America. From I July 1993 wholesale prices in Germany were more
than 70 percent higher than in July 1992. The Netherlands had a similar price increase. However, the effects of price increases in these two countries might be partly offset by reductions elsewhere in the EC. In France, for example, wholesale prices were slightly lower in 1993 than in 1992. Reduced EC imports might be partly offset by growth in the United States and Japan, where wholesale prices declined considerably in 1993.
Uncertain outlook for 1994
Hurricane damage during 1993 resulted in some losses in banana production in Colombia and Honduras, which, however, is unlikely to reduce markedly the excess of export supply capacity over imports. Some further eradication of plantations in Ecuador was likely to remove areas of marginal production amounting to 20 percent of the total but with a lesser impact on output, A continuation of excess supply and depressed prices outside the EC was thus likely.
Bananas and the European Community
New EC regulations, in force from 1 July 1993 provide for:
o No limit to imports of bananas produced within the EC but compensation payments limited to a maximum of 854 000 tonnes.
o Duty free imports from ACP members up to their highest historical trade level but amended in the light of feasible trade. The EC proposal for traditional supplies was 852 700 tonnes.
o A tariff quota of 2 million tonnes (net weight) shall be opened each year for imports of third country bananas and non-traditional ACP banana supplies.
Within the framework of the tariff quota, imports of third-country bananas shall be subject to a levy of ECU 100 per tonne, and imports of non-traditional ACP supplies shall be subject to a zero duty.
o Apart from the quota referred to above, imports of nontraditional ACP supplies shall be subject to a levy of ECU 750 per tonne; imports of third-country bananas shall be subject to a levy of ECU 850 per tonne.
o The quantities of third-country bananas and non-traditional ACP supplies re-exported out of the EC shall not be charged to the quota referred to above.
o The tariff quota shall be opened from 1 July 1993 with:
66.5 percent to the category of operators who marketed third-country and/or non-traditional ACP supplies;
30 percent to the category of operators who marketed EC and/or traditional ACP supplies;
3.5 percent to the category of operators established in the EC who started marketing bananas other than EC and/or traditional ACP supplies from 1992.
o The import opportunities pursuant to (a) and (b) shall be available only to operators established in the EC who marketed on their own account a minimum quantity, to be determined, of bananas from the above origins.

Pepper
Output decline continued in 1993
World pepper output fell 19 percent to about 173 000 tonnes in 1993. Yields were down in most major producing countries as continuing low returns had caused producers to reduce applications of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. The largest decrease in output was expected in the Far East, particularly in Indonesia, where excessive rains in the producing regions of Lampung and southern Sumatra during most of 1992 and early 1993 were the determining factor for the estimated decline of 40 percent,
Crop decreased in 1992
World pepper production had decreased by 7 percent in 1992 from the record harvest of the previous two years. The decline in prices that followed the record harvests had already led to neglect of vine husbandry and reduction in yields. In addition, marginal production areas were abandoned or uprooted. Pepper output in Latin America dropped by 39 percent, mainly as a result of a 42 percent fall in Brazil where approximately 15 000 ha were taken out of production. In the Far East the full impact of low prices was not discernable until late in the year and the 1992 pepper harvest was slightly larger than that of the previous year. Almost all pepper producing countries in the region harvested slightly larger crops except Malaysia, where output declined by 10 percent. In Africa, production was close to the 1991 level.
Lower imports, but higher re-exports in 1992
Global pepper imports, originating from producing and re-exporting countries, during 1992 decreased slightly, to around 210 000 tonnes. Lower imports from producers were largely offset by higher re-exports, mainly from Singapore and the Netherlands. Imports by Africa declined by 40 percent, mainly as a result of smaller purchases by Algeria and Tunisia, those of countries of the former USSR fell by 29 percent, and of Latin America and the Caribbean by 13 percent. The decline in Latin America and the Caribbean was largely the result of reduced purchases by Mexico and Argentina. In contrast, North America increased imports by 6 percent, and other increases were in the Near East and eastern Europe, mainly Poland and the former Czechoslovakia.
Smaller exports in 1992
Exports from producing countries declined 11 percent to around 150 000 tonnes in 1992. The drop in shipments was largely the consequence of lower availabilities, and of stock-building in producing countries in expectation of smaller harvests by major producers, and of a price rise in 1993. Pepper exports from Latin America dropped 40 percent reflecting reduced shipments from Brazil, the region's main producer. In the Far East, exports were maintained at 118 000 tonnes, as higher exports from Indonesia and Thailand offset lower shipments from Malaysia and Viet Nam. Exports from India remained virtually unchanged at around 19 000 tonnes. Africa's relatively small exports increased by close to 50 percent.
Export earnings from pepper in 1992 decreased for the fifth consecutive season to $156 million. The 29 percent decrease in global export earnings was the result of both reduced export volumes and prices. Pepper export earnings in Brazil, the most affected country, were more than halved from $49 million in 1991 to $22 million in 1992. In the Far East, where export revenues dropped by nearly $40 million, Viet Nam, Malaysia and India were most affected. In Africa there was a slight increase in earnings from pepper.
Market recovered in 1993
The falling trend of prices was reversed during 1993 with reduced harvests and speculative withholding of large stocks, mainly of white pepper. The annual average spot price for Sarawak white pepper in London rose to 245 US cents/kg from 162 US cents/kg in 1992. However, this price was still well below the levels of the late eighties especially 1987 when it was 613 US cents/kg. The London spot price for Sarawak black pepper also rose but less sharply. This price returned to the 1991 level but was still less than one third of the level obtained in 1987. There was a similar response by the New York and Singapore markets in both black and white pepper.
Outlook for relatively stable supplies and prices
Early forecasts for the 1994 season suggested a further fall in output in most major producing countries as yields were likely to continue to decline. However, production in Indonesia should recover somewhat, to about 55 000 tonnes, a factor which might, at least in the short-term, prevent further sizable increases in prices. However, Black Malabar was expected to continue to command a premium, as the demand for this high quality pepper was likely to be maintained.

Rice
Trade rose but prices averaged lower in 1993
Global rice trade rose by 4 percent to 14.5 million tonnes in 1993. The increase reflected the exceptionally large volume of trade in the final quarter of the year following Japan's purchases to meet domestic shortages caused by an exceptionally poor crop. This would be its first major rice import since 1984. The Philippines also bought to replenish stock after an absence of two years. In the Near East, rice imports reached a new peak following increased demand in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia and the removal of restrictions on private imports. Imports of Africa and Europe were also slightly higher. By contrast, imports by other countries in the Far East, Latin America and the countries of the former USSR declined. Indonesia, which purchased 0.6 million tonnes in 1992, bought no rice in 1993 but exported substantial quantities instead. This change in Indonesia's position exerted considerable downward pressure on prices, especially in early 1993.
Moreover, imports into the countries of the former USSR, which rose in 1992 to one of their highest levels in recent years, declined sharply due to a shortage of foreign exchange. Imports of Mexico and Peru in 1993 were also considerably smaller than the record quantities purchased in the previous year.
FAO export price index for rice
Quarterly export prices from Thailand and from the United States
The United States was the main traditional exporting country to expand exports and increase its market share in 1993. From late 1992 it enlarged its Export Enhancement Programme for rice. The export prices of the United States were also lowered, triggering a sharp recovery of shipments, especially to the Near East and the EC. In particular, large sales were concluded with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which had not bought from the United States for some time. By contrast, exports out of Thailand in early 1993 declined because of strong competition from other countries, but recovered later in the year to total 4.8 million tonnes, virtually the same quantity exported in the previous year. Pakistan's exports fell heavily, disrupted by the internal re-structuring of its rice export industry. Exports from Viet Nam declined slightly as did exports from India, the EC and Australia.
International rice prices were lower on average, with the FAO Export Price Index for Rice falling from 109 to 99. The decline was mainly in the first half of the year. The United States' export prices fell in the first quarter to the levels of competing grades from Thailand. However, starting in the second quarter, the price differential between Thai and United States' rice diverged once again, as Thailand responded by reducing prices further. In the last quarter of 1993, however, international rice prices recovered sharply as a result of Japan's imports and a marked deterioration of the outlook for the 1993 world paddy crop. Prices for United States' medium grain rice gained most with an increase of over $100 per ton in October, and continued to climb in that last quarter. By contrast, China was the most competitive seller of lower quality rice throughout the year, because of large supplies left with the State Grain Bureaux following the abolition of its ration scheme and a
fall in the dollar value of its currency.
The value of rice exported from developing countries declined 10 percent to $2.7 million. Thailand suffered a 10 percent decline in export earnings. China, Pakistan and Viet Nam were also affected by reduced rice earnings.
Outlook for record trade and higher prices in 1994
The boost to world trade and prices in 1994 was likely to come from increased import demand following a crop that was smaller than the 1992 record and reduced opening stocks. In particular, the international market for medium grain rice, which had contracted substantially in recent years, was expected to recover strongly as the output of countries consuming this type of rice was cut back by unseasonably cold weather and pest infestation. The drastic fall in Japan's output of paddy in 1993, for example, was expected to result in a substantial shortage that would need to be compensated by imports. Reduced production could bring the Democratic Republic of Korea into the world market as a substantial rice importer in 1994. In China, a reduced crop coupled with strong economic growth was expected to lead to increased purchases from the international market especially to meet the growing domestic demand for higher quality rice, despite the shift to increased cultivation of higher
quality varieties. The Philippines was also likely to import as production and stocks had fallen. Import demand by these countries, together with the continued substantial purchases of traditional large importers such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore was expected to result in a recovery of Far East imports.
Global trade in 1994 was also expected to be strengthened by the larger import demand of North America, Latin America and Europe, especially the EC. The consumption of rice in Canada and the United States has risen considerably in the past decade as changes in dietary patterns have favoured rice. In addition, growth in the Asian community has increased demand for varieties grown in Asia. These trends were expected to boost imports in 1994. Mexico and Peru were also expected to expand imports following reduced output in 1993. In the EC, imports from third countries were likely to increase because of a fall in output within the Community. By contrast, Africa's import requirements were likely to decline from the 1993 level. However, the final outcome would depend upon the availability of food aid in rice, as rising international rice prices in 1994 were likely to hold down commercial purchases. Similarly, the countries of the former USSR were expected to import less in 1994,
reflecting continued scarcity of foreign exchange.
The projected increase in world import demand was anticipated to be met by larger export availabilities from the United States and Viet Nam. Exports by the United States were forecast to reach their highest level since the late 1970s. As one of the few major exporters of medium grain rice, the United States was expected to benefit substantially from stronger demand for this type in 1994. In Viet Nam, substantial carry-over stocks and ample crops were also expected to result in larger exports. Increased world demand could also be expected to boost the exports of several less prominent and newer exporting countries. Australia, primarily an exporter of medium grain rice, was expected to have record exports. Bangladesh and Indonesia, both relatively new exporting countries, were also likely to benefit from the recovery in world trade as importers sought alternative sources and buying arrangements. By contrast, exports out of China and the EC were expected to fall because of
reduced availabilities, while Thailand's exports could be constrained by a reduced 1993 output.
A third successive year of stock decline
Aggregate stocks at the end of the 1994 marketing season were forecast to be further reduced both in the developing and developed countries. The largest decline would be in China as a result of diminished production in 1993. Stocks in India and Indonesia were also expected to contract. In Japan, stocks would shrink to a record low following a drastic reduction in output. In the United States, stocks would have to be drawn down to maintain exports as production had fallen.

Wheat
Production recovered in 1992
Global wheat production recovered from the sharp drop in 1991 rising 3.5 percent in 1992. All of this production increase was due to higher yields while harvested area was reduced. Total output in the developed countries recovered sharply, particularly in the United States, due to a lower set-aside and higher prices. Output also rose in the countries of the former USSR and in Australia, mainly as a result of improved weather. However, unfavourable weather led to smaller harvests in most other developed countries, including Canada, South Africa, a number of EC countries, Poland and Romania. Aggregate 1992 wheat production in the developing countries also expanded, mainly due to exceptionally good weather conditions in most parts of Asia. By contrast, prolonged drought depressed the harvest in Africa, while adverse weather problems resulted in slightly reduced production in Latin America.
Reduced import demand and trade in 1992/93
World imports of wheat in 1992/93 fell 7 percent below the previous year's record level. The factors influencing international trade in 1992/93 included bumper harvests in several major importing countries and sharply reduced demand by the world's two largest wheat importers, China and the countries of the former USSR.
Aggregate wheat imports by the developing countries declined 9 percent to 67 million tonnes in 1992/93. Most of the decline occurred in Asia, where imports fell by 17 percent, following a record crop in China. A notable exception was India, importing 3 million tonnes of wheat in 1992/93 to offset below-target domestic grain procurement. In Africa, notable increases occurred in Morocco, as a result of a drought reduced crop, and in Nigeria, where imports doubled following the lifting of its previous import ban. While unfavourable weather conditions led to larger imports into Somalia, higher domestic output reduced those by Egypt, Libya, and Sudan. Wheat purchases by Latin America and the Caribbean increased slightly in 1992/93 from the previous year except in Mexico, where a smaller output and the low quality of the 1992 crop triggered larger imports.
Total imports into the developed countries in 1992/93 fell slightly to 32 million tonnes. Larger purchases by South Africa and several non-EC European countries offset, to a large degree, the fall in shipments to countries of the former USSR, where the harvest was above average. A combination of smaller crops and reduced domestic government procurement boosted imports by Poland and Romania.
Despite the contraction in global wheat trade in 1992193, all major exporters increased shipments with the exception of Canada, where the lower quality and smaller size of its 1992 crop resulted in a 10 percent decline. However, wheat exports from several smaller exporting countries fell significantly in 1992/93. In Eastern Europe, only Hungary and Bulgaria remained in the export market, but their combined sales were well below 1991/92 levels. In Asia, Turkey exported only half as much as the previous year's record.
The value of world wheat exports in calendar 1992 rose 20 percent and average export unit values by 17 percent reflecting substantially higher prices during the first half of the year. The wheat import bill of the developing countries increased by nearly 25 percent to over $11 000 million in 1992.
Consumption up, less used for food in 1992/93
Global utilization of wheat was one percent larger in 1992/93, but was still slightly below the long-term trend. Most of the estimated rise in wheat utilization was for food, maintaining annual per caput food consumption at 71 kg. The increase in wheat consumption was slight in the developed countries, primarily in the countries of the former USSR, where subsidized wheat bread substituted other more costly food. By contrast, global feed use declined by 6 percent. The contraction in feed was mainly in the developed countries, particularly in Europe where poor weather reduced supplies. Total wheat consumption rose by about 2 percent in the developing countries. Food use of wheat increased, especially in Asia, but the use of wheat for feed fell from the relatively high levels of the previous year. In Africa, the per caput consumption of wheat was maintained largely through higher imports to offset the sharp drop in production caused by the widespread drought.
Higher stocks and lower prices in 1992/93
Higher production in 1992 and reduced import demand was reflected in a 5 percent expansion of global stocks for crop years ending in 1993. World carryovers at 143 million tonnes remained, however, considerably below the record levels of the mid-1980s. The major wheat exporters accounted for most of the increase in stocks, while inventories were drawn down by half in Eastern Europe as a result of a sharp fall in production. In the developing countries, wheat stocks were built up substantially in some parts of Asia. By contrast, stock reductions occurred in North Africa and China.
The average quoted price for US Hard Winter No. 2 in 1992/93 was 5 percent lower than in the previous year reflecting the reduced demand. The price of $142 per tonne was, however, above that actually paid by many importing countries on account of the continuing large volume of sales attracting subsidies under the Export Enhancement Programme and other export subsidization arrangements. By comparison, the price of unsubsidized Argentinean wheat averaged $123 per tonne in 1992/93, $9 per tonne above the 1991/92 average.
Production unchanged in 1993
Global wheat output in 1993 was estimated at 566 million tonnes, virtually unchanged from the previous year. Harvests in the developed countries were down slightly. In the United States and Canada production was somewhat below the 1992 levels, but still above the average of the previous five years. The reduction in the United States was despite relaxation in the Area Reduction Programme with the set-aside for wheat reduced to zero. Moreover, excessive moisture during the growing season lowered the average protein content and hence the quality of their wheat supplies. Smaller crops were also estimated for countries of the former USSR due to contraction in the area sown and a delayed harvest. In Europe, the EC's production fell due to an increased area set aside and reduced support prices under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy as well as to drought in a few countries. However, this decline was partially offset by increased crops in several Eastern European countries.
Wheat production in the developing countries rose, mainly on account of record or above-average crops in Asia. However, wheat output in Africa remained close to the reduced level of the previous year, following another year of drought, particularly in northern Africa. In Latin America, a slight increase in production in Argentina was offset by a smaller crop in Brazil.
Developed countries to import less in 1993/94
International trade in wheat was forecast to decline further in 1993/94, by 6 percent, because of larger crops in several of the major importing countries. The developed countries would account for all of the decline, principally Poland, Romania and the countries of the former USSR, while imports by the developing countries were forecast to remain unchanged. The likely increase of imports into North Africa, because of drought-reduced production, were expected to be offset by declines in Asia, particularly China, India and Pakistan. With the expected contraction in global import demand, shipments from the major exporters would fall by some 9 percent in 1993/94. Among major exporters, only Australia was expected to increase deliveries following a recovery in output. By contrast, aggregate shipments from smaller exporters were anticipated to remain at the previous year's reduced level with larger exports from Turkey and Sweden offsetting smaller shipments from Hungary, Bulgaria
and Saudi Arabia.
Increased global utilization predicted for 1993/94
Global utilization of wheat in 1993/94 was forecast to increase by 2 percent to 567 million tonnes with all of the rise likely to occur in the developing countries. There, consumption of wheat as food was expected to grow, notably in a number of Asian countries with higher production. The use of wheat as feed was also anticipated to increase substantially in 1993/94 as the abundance of low quality wheat was likely to compete successfully with other grains in animal feed rations.
Stocks to contract in 1993/94
Global wheat stocks were forecast to be drawn down by 3 percent, to 139 million tonnes, for crop years ending in 1994. For some major exporters, the expected lower production and higher domestic consumption were likely to reduce wheat stocks, irrespective of the bleaker export prospects. The most significant decline in stocks could occur in Canada resulting from the anticipated downturn in production. By contrast, carryover stocks held in the United States were expected to expand as exports were likely to fall. The abundance of low quality wheat was expected to maintain downward pressure on its international price with keen competition among exporters. However, the market for high quality wheat was likely to be characterized by scarcity and upward pressure on prices.
Changes in cereal stock policies
One of the consequences of a generalized move towards liberalization of cereal production and external trade policies could be reduction in cereal stocks held by the public sector. This reduction could be considerable in the United States and other major cereal producing and exporting countries and may not be fully offset by increased stockholding by the private sector. There could thus be a decline in the ratio of cereal stocks to utilization, which is one of the key indicators of stability in global cereal supplies and prices, and hence of food security. In many developing countries too, reductions in market intervention and in the size of stocks held by the public sector have been widespread in recent years, usually as part of structural adjustment programmes. However, these countries are likely to continue to hold some public stocks for food security purposes, which is permitted under the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Agreement. One implication of the foregoing could
be that countries will come to rely more on trade, than on domestic stocks, for their food supplies during shortages. Further information on national cereal stock policies and other policy developments is provided in FAO's Cereal Policies Review 1992-93.

Coarse grains
Production up 7 percent in 1992
Global output of coarse grains rose 7 percent in 1992. The increase affected all grains except barley, which declined due to a drought in Europe. In the United States, production rose by 27 percent as good weather and lower area reduction requirements resulted in a record maize crop. Similarly, favourable weather boosted yields substantially in countries of the former USSR. However, poor weather in many European countries reduced aggregate output by 18 percent. Elsewhere among developed countries, South Africa experienced one of the worst crops in recent history, which was down 62 percent from an already reduced level in 1991.
Output in the developing countries rose by 6 percent. In Asia, it rose mainly as a result of larger crops in India due to improved weather. In China and Turkey, however, smaller crops were harvested due to drought, while in Thailand, production fell because of reduced plantings. In Latin America, a combination of good weather and larger area boosted production in nearly all major producing countries. Partially offsetting these gains were production shortfalls due to poor weather in Africa. Morocco recorded a two-thirds reduction in output due to drought, and large falls occurred in many countries in the sub-Saharan region, especially Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Contraction of developed country imports dominant
In 1992/93 World trade in coarse grains in 1992/93 (July/June) was 3 percent down on the previous year. In the developed countries, the notable expansion in shipments to South Africa and several countries in Eastern Europe was offset by reduced imports into countries of the former USSR and the EC. By contrast, aggregate imports into the developing countries, particularly in drought-affected Africa, rose by 8 percent. Most of this increase occurred in southern Africa, where even established maize exporters, such as Zambia and Zimbabwe, had to rely on large imports to cover domestic shortfalls. In northern Africa, only Morocco's imports were notably larger, due to a reduced output of barley. In Asia, shipments to the Republic of Korea rose the most, reflecting growing demand by the livestock sector. In contrast imports into Saudi Arabia were reduced, due to lower domestic demand, and into the Islamic Republic of Iran due to larger domestic crops. In Latin America, larger crops
in Mexico led to a 17 percent decline in imports while in Venezuela, imports doubled as a result of reduced domestic output.
While the global volume of imports fell in 1992/93, only Canada among the major coarse grain exporters shipped less in 1992/93, largely due to smaller maize and barley harvests. it was among the minor exporting countries that most of the contraction occurred with notably sharp decreases for Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey and Zimbabwe,
In the calendar year 1992 the global import bill increased by 11 percent to over $16 000 million with a 9 percent increase in volume combined with a small increase in prices. In the developing countries, a much larger increase in their purchases led to a 27 percent leap in their import bill to over $6 000 million.
Utilization expanded in 1992/93
Global coarse grains utilization expanded for the second consecutive year, in 1992/93 it was up 2 percent to 843 million tonnes. Most of the increase was in maize, sorghum and millet. Food consumption grew by 10 million tonnes and feed use by 7 million tonnes. In the developing countries the expansion added 1.5 kg/caput to annual food consumption. However, in the developed countries, coarse grain utilization fell slightly. Significant reductions in feed use occurred in the countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe as a result of reduced demand in the livestock sector. Additionally, in several countries in Europe, weather-reduced production also contributed to contraction in coarse grain use. By contrast, a bumper crop in the United States lowered prices and induced record levels of feeding.
Stocks rose sharply and prices fell in 1992/93
World coarse grain stocks at the end of the 1992/93 seasons were 21 percent up and at their highest level for four years. The sharpest build-up in inventories occurred in the United States as a result of bumper maize and sorghum crops. In the EC, a major holder of maize and barley stocks, inventories rose slightly in 1992/93. Stocks also expanded in countries of the former USSR following a favourable crop but decreased in Eastern Europe and South Africa as production fell. In the developing countries, aggregate coarse grain carryovers rose slightly with the largest build-up in Latin America following bumper crops. However, in Asia, stocks were drawn down because of higher domestic use and somewhat smaller imports.
International coarse grain prices in 1992/93 remained below 1991/92 levels, on average. The average maize price, as measured by the US export price, fell by 12 percent, to $97 per tonne, the lowest since 1987/88. Average export prices also fell for barley and sorghum.

Sharp decline in production estimated for 1993
World production in 1993 was the smallest in five years and 9 percent smaller than the previous year. Most of this decline was related to dramatic reductions in maize crops in the United States mainly due to unfavourable weather. In Europe, however, production rose above the drought-reduced crop of 1992 because of favourable harvests in non-EC countries. In the EC the recovery in yields was offset by a decrease in area reflecting the introduction of a set aside of arable land, initially of 15 percent. Larger crops were estimated for Canada due to a significant expansion of planting resulting from diversion of land from wheat. In South Africa, improved weather conditions brought a recovery in the size of the 1993 crop harvested earlier in that year.
Output in the developing countries also demonstrated a mixed picture in 1993. Total production in Asia declined, largely as a result of reduced crops in China, India and Indonesia. In sub-Saharan Africa, a strong recovery from the 1992 drought-reduced level more than offset a second below-average crop in northern Africa. In Latin America, aggregate output remained above average, though somewhat smaller than in 1992 when record crops were harvested in several countries.
Volume of trade to decline further in 1993/94
A 10 percent contraction in the volume of international trade in coarse grains to 82 million tonnes was forecast for 1993/94, making it the smallest since 1987/88. Most of the contraction was expected to be in the volume of maize traded.
Total imports by the developed countries were forecast to contract by 15 percent, as a result of an anticipated reduction in shipments to South Africa and to nearly all non-EC countries in Europe, where production recovered in 1993.
Aggregate imports into the developing countries in 1993/94 were forecast to decline by 6 percent. Imports were only likely to increase in a few countries, mainly in North Africa, due to reduced crops. Most of the forecast decline in imports was on account of the recovery of sub-Saharan Africa from the 1992 drought. Imports by the developing countries in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean were not expected to differ much from the previous year.
Export availabilities seemed sufficient to meet the forecast import demand despite a substantial contraction in supplies. In addition, the abundance of low quality wheat would be a substitute for maize in animal feeding, thus reducing import demand for coarse grains.
Global utilization to change little in 1993/94
World coarse grain utilization was forecast to decline slightly in 1993194 to 832 million tonnes. All of the downward adjustment was expected to be in feed use, especially in the United States. The large fall in production there was likely to result in higher domestic prices of coarse grains. This, together with an expected further fall in prices of low-quality wheat, should trigger greater use of wheat and lower use of coarse grains as feed in the United States as well as in the EC. In the developing countries, utilization was forecast to contract, particularly in India following an estimated drop in production and a further substitution of wheat for coarse grains in the diet. By contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, total use was expected to return to the average level of the years before the 1992/93 drought-affected season. In the developing countries as a whole a slight decline in per caput food consumption of coarse grains was forecast for 1993/94.
Stocks to be drawn down in 1993/94
Global stocks at the end of 1993/94 were forecast to fall by 24 percent to 123 million tonnes. The contraction was expected to be most dramatic in the United States following the sharp fall in maize production in 1993. Most other major coarse grain exporters were, however, likely to add to carryover stocks due, in part, to enlarged production. South Africa should also be in a position to replenish maize stocks following an increased harvest. Total end of season stocks in developing countries were likely to be smaller, especially in North Africa and in Asia. China, in particular, was expected to reduce coarse grain stocks to cover a production shortfall. The smaller production and inventories forecast for major exporters were expected to exert upward pressure on coarse grain prices in 1993/94.

Cassava
Production higher in 1993
World cassava output rose by 7 percent in root equivalent according to estimates for 1993. Output in Africa grew by 14 percent, primarily in Nigeria where production reached a record following a significant expansion in plantings and the continued adoption of pest-resistant, high-yielding varieties. Production also rose in Benin, Burundi, Cte d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Zaire, but fell significantly in Angola and Liberia with civil strife and damage from the mealy-bug. Crops were severely diminished in Madagascar, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda by unfavourable climatic conditions. In Latin America, expansion resumed with increases in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay. In Brazil, crops recovered from the previous year's drought-reduced level but remained well below the recent trend. In the Far East, total output was estimated to have fallen reflecting smaller crops in India and China, whereas little change was anticipated in Thailand.
Utilization increased in 1993
Consumption as food increased by 8 percent in line with the expansion of production in 1993.
Prices of cassava/soybean meal and barley in the EC
The increase in consumption was most pronounced in Africa, where cassava is grown mainly for food. Larger production resulted in higher per caput food availability in Nigeria, Cte d'Ivoire and Mozambique, while in the rest of the region reduced consumption followed lower output. Consumption per caput rose slightly in Latin America, but was lower in most countries in Asia. In the developed countries, feed utilization fell, reflecting higher prices for cassava/soybean meal compounds in some countries, including Japan and the United States, while in the rest of the world, feed use was largely unchanged, particularly in the EC where cassava remained competitive.
Prices for cassava pellets sharply down in the EC: increased in other markets
In 1993, the EC import price for cassava pellets averaged $137 per tonne or 25 percent lower than in 1992. The decline reflected increased competition from grains; the effect of higher prices for soybean meal, which is combined with cassava in compound feeds; and the appreciation of the US dollar relative to European currencies. Sales to the EC by Thailand, the largest exporter, were regulated under the "bonus quota system" as in previous years. In 1993, exporters were eligible to ship up to 2 tonnes to the EC for each tonne exported to other destinations. This two-for-one ratio in 1993 was higher than the 1.3 for 1 granted in 1992. However, a decline in prices obtained in the EC reduced the profits from these sales and thus the "subsidy" for sales to non-EC markets. Export prices to non-EC markets were consequently raised some 10 percent to levels varying between $60 and $70 per tonne f.o.b. Bangkok,
Trade declined in 1993
Curtailed shipments to non-EC markets of pellets for feeds as a result of higher prices, outweighed growth in sales of cassava flour and starch in 1993 and global trade declined by 6 percent. The volume of global trade was some 10 million tonnes in dry cassava pellets, equivalent to 25 million tonnes of roots. The bulk of chips and pellets traded were for feed and alcohol use, while about 12 percent was shipped for starch and flour use. As in the past, Thailand was the main supplier, with 84 percent of global exports followed by Indonesia with 11 percent. On the import side, the EC continued to dominate the market accounting for two-thirds of global imports.
Exports from Thailand fell by 8 percent to 8.5 million tonnes, mainly as a result of a reduction in sales to non-EC markets, reflecting a decline in "subsidies" on these sales, aggravated by higher prices for the complementary soybean meal. Thailand's sales to the EC, were maintained at about 5.5 million tonnes in keeping with the 1991-94 voluntary export restraint agreement'. China and
Indonesia were entitled to export 5 percent more to the EC in 1993 following the 1992 renewal of their cooperation agreements. Indonesia fulfilled its overall access entitlement of 866 000 tonnes and so too did the group of minor exporters in Latin America, Africa and the Far East, together supplying 145 000 tonnes. However, larger domestic requirements in China prevented this country from supplying all of its 367 000 tonne allowance.
Total imports by the EC remained little changed at some 6.8 million tonnes, less than the maximum 7.2 million tonnes allowed under its various agreements with cassava suppliers. The decline in 1993 world imports thus mainly reflected much reduced shipments to non-EC countries, including China, the Republic of Korea and the United States, brought about by the rise in prices for exports to these markets. This shortfall was not offset by the greater purchases of the Czech and Slovak Republics, Japan, Poland, Turkey and the countries of the former USSR.
The decline in the average export price for pellets, combined with the contraction in the volume of cassava traded, indicated a reduction of 18 percent in the overall value of cassava exports. Export earnings from cassava flour rebounded somewhat, reflecting both higher prices and an increase in export volume of some 10 percent.
Production in 1994 likely to fall in Asia but increase in Africa and Latin America
Preliminary estimates of the area under cassava crops in Asia suggest a smaller harvest in 1994. In particular, there has been a marked reduction in plantings in Thailand where expectations for lower returns encouraged a diversification towards alternative crops. However, output could expand further in Africa and Latin America. In Africa, the continued propagation of higher-yielding and pest-resistant varieties was expected to result in larger crops. However, the incidence of pest and diseases in some countries mainly reliant on old varieties, could again constrain yields. Production in Nigeria, the largest producer, could be adversely affected by the lifting of the cereal import ban in 1993. In Latin America, Colombia's output was again likely to rise, following the setting of attractive producer prices for 1993/94.
Lower EC prices and trade contraction likely in 1994
Prices for cassava pellets in the EC were anticipated to continue to be under downward pressure in 1994, in response to policy developments there. This would further erode the two-tier system that has prevailed since 1984. The associated raising of export prices to non-EC destinations was expected to narrow the wide price differential between the EC and non-EC markets that has characterized the international cassava sector over the past ten years. As a result, exports of pellets to non-EC markets, which account for some 20 percent of world exports, were likely to be curtailed. By contrast, sustained demand for cassava flour and starch was forecast on the basis of strong economic growth in Asian countries. Imports by the EC were also forecast to fall in 1994, irrespective of competition from other feeds, as Thailand had already used about 16.5 million tonnes of its four-year export allowance to the EC during 1991-93, leaving only 4.75 million tonnes, that is 750 000 tonnes
less than the 1993 figure. Moreover, failing cassava prices in the EC could discourage other major suppliers from fulfilling their export entitlements, thus contributina to a reduction in EC imports. However, a major area of uncertainty concerns the renewal of the cooperation agreement which, if it materialized. could allow Thailand to export an additional 650 000 tonnes in 1994.

Global output was estimated at 58 million tonnes, close to the record levels of 1990 and 1991. In the developing countries, notably India, production was above average but below the 1991 record. However, output in Pakistan fell for the second consecutive year, with chickpeas, the country's main pulse crop, being affected by disease and frost. Production was also down in Thailand, Bangladesh and Nepal, largely due to smaller plantings and yields reduced by adverse weather conditions. In the Near East, total production fell for the second consecutive year. In Turkey, the region's major producer, the downward trend in output continued into 1993 reflecting a rise in production costs relative to prospective prices.
In Africa, total pulse output was estimated to have remained close to that of the previous year. Crops in several countries of northern and eastern Africa were affected by irregular rainfall, disease and shortages of seed and fertilizer. By contrast, production recovered in Zaire, Malawi and Mozambique, with more favourable weather.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, total output dropped for the second consecutive year, mainly because a severe drought in Brazil's northeast sharply curtailed plantings and yields. Argentina's pulse crop contracted in response to a glut and depressed prices in the previous year and was further diminished by bad harvest weather. In Mexico, production recovered from the drought-reduced level of 1992.
Output of the developed countries continued to recover although it remained below the average for 1988-1990. In North America the harvest was big, 2.6 million tonnes, in spite of unfavourable weather conditions, mainly due to an unprecedented expansion of plantings in Canada. This expansion was spurred by the rise in earnings from pulses in 1992 relative to competing grain and oilseed crops. In the United States, by contrast, production recovered only slightly in the shadow of high stocks and reduced export prospects.
In the EC, earlier expectations that the area seeded to pulses would decline with the new set-aside regulations did not materialize. One reason for the expansion in plantings in 1993 was that farmers were offered attractive compensatory payments to grow protein crops. The crop amounted to 5.9 million tons, close to the 1990 record. By contrast, production in Eastern Europe was adversely affected by drought as well as by reduced input use. In countries of the former USSR, production also declined with lower demand for pulses from the contracting livestock sector. Australia's production dropped by over 10 percent as there was dry weather and a shift into wheat and barley, while favourable weather in South Africa allowed yields and production to recover somewhat from the drought-reduced level of 1992.
Utilization also recovered
Global consumption of pulses recovered during 1993 with an increase in both food and feed use. Food consumption in Asia rose with expanded supplies, particularly in India, while consumption in Africa dropped further. Feed consumption in the developing countries expanded for the third consecutive year. In the developed countries, consumption of pulses as food remained unchanged, while feed use recovered but was still below the 1988-90 average level. In Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR, feed utilization of pulses continued to be depressed by a decline in the livestock industry.
Pattern of trade changed within a static total
Global pulse trade amounted to 6.4 million tonnes in 1993, close to the level of the two previous years. Within the total, imports by India and the EC fell slightly. In India, the decline reflected larger output while in the EC import demand for feed pulses seemed to decline with keener competition from domestically produced grains following the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Other countries where foreign purchases fell included Algeria, Cuba and Venezuela. By contrast, Mexico, Morocco and Pakistan expanded imports to compensate for reduced domestic supplies. South Africa, normally an exporter, imported pulses for the second consecutive year, as domestic supply again fell short of demand.
For the developing country exporters, shipments from China grew, but were largely offset by declines elsewhere. Shipments from Argentina and Chile fell markedly as a result of both reduced import demand and a sharp reduction in exportable surpluses. Exports from Thailand and Turkey continued to be affected by increasing international competition.
Total exports from the developed countries rose, mainly reflecting a boost in Australia's shipments following stronger demand from import markets, notably from Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Canada maintained its role as a leading exporter while shipments from the United States remained depressed, mainly reflecting lower import demand from customary buyers in Latin America and North Africa.
Prices of selected pulses
No major price changes in 1993
Ample stocks in most of the developed exporting countries continued to hold down international prices for most pulses in 1993. In addition, reduced demand for feed pulses in the EC contributed to a downward pressure on prices for peas, while bean prices were depressed by a contraction of import demand in countries supplied by the United States. World lentil markets were characterized by large carry-over stocks, increased competition among exporters and a slight drop in demand. By contrast. prices for chickpeas continued to rise, mainly reflecting strong demand from Pakistan and India in the second half of the year. The estimated total value of exports was similar to that of 1992, as were average export unit values. The developing countries' share in ,global export earnings increased to 47 percent.
Some reduction in world trade likely in 1994
Prospects for export supply and import demand indicate a slight fall in the volume of trade in 1994. This would be largely due to lower import demand in some countries, notably in Central America, North Africa and the EC. The anticipated volume of imports by India was still uncertain as a poor Kharif crop harvested in late 1993 would stimulate imports in early 1994, but this may be offset by an increase in the subsequent Rabi crop, for which prospects are favourable. Similarly, Pakistan's imports could fall from the record level in 1993, should an average crop be harvested in early 1994. In Brazil, by contrast, imports were expected to increase slightly due to the shortfall in 1993 production and lower government stocks. Also in Mexico, import demand may rise in 1994 as the announced reforms of the agricultural support system could lead to a contraction of bean production.
On the supply side, export availabilities in Eastern Europe, Australia and parts of Africa were forecast to fall, mainly because of reduced crops in 1993. No change was expected in exports from North America where bad weather degraded the voluminous crop and largely consigned it to be used domestically as feed. With the prospect that supplies of food quality pulses might be reduced until the harvest in the northern hemisphere in late 1994, Argentina and Chile have stepped up plantings.
Competition among major lentil exporters was likely to remain keen in 1994 tending to hold down international prices for lentils. By contrast, chickpea prices could be supported by reduced world supplies and a growth in import demand. Prices for feed quality pulses were likely to be held down by the degradation to feed use of other crops harvested in many areas in late 1993, together with the anticipated reduction in import demand in the EC.

Oilseeds, oils and oilmeals
Consumption expansion slow in 1993
World consumption of fats and oils grew by an 2.5 percent in 1993, that is less than the rate of growth during the 1980s of 3.8 percent per year. The slower growth reflected another year of sluggish expansion of the world economy. The slow growth in world consumption also reflected the adjustments to the changed economic environment in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR. There an upsurge in consumer prices has reduced consumption since 1991 to well below levels in earlier years. In addition, imports of many countries were constrained by a continuing scarcity of foreign exchange. However, in India, bumper oilseed crops contributed to a boost in consumption.
For oilmeals, the increase in global consumption in 1993, at 2 percent, was below the 3.7 percent of the 1980s. There was a further sharp fall in countries of the former USSR and, to a lesser extent, in most Eastern European countries. In this area, oilmeal consumption was, by 1993, less than 60 percent of its level in the late 1980s as the transition to a market economy has been accompanied by a severe shrinkage of the livestock sector. Also, in countries of the former USSR, foreign exchange constraints continued to delay the implementation of policies aimed at increasing the oilmeal content of livestock rations. Little growth occurred in the EC as one effect of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms was to lower prices of feed grains, thus they tended to displace oilmeals in feed rations, especially in the second half of the year. This contraction in use of oilmeals has been accentuated by a rise in their price. By contrast, in many other important consuming
countries where the livestock economy, especially the pig and poultry sectors, continued to grow and where favourable feed/livestock price ratios enhanced the profitability of livestock feeding, oilmeal consumption expanded. In China, however, growth in utilization was weakened by a decline in output of meals.
FAO price indices: oils and oilmeals 1984-87 = 100
Oil output below trend, but oilmeals above trend in 1993
World production of fats and oils increased by 2 percent to 97 million tonnes in 1993, and that of oilmeals by 4 percent to 57 million tonnes. While the production of oils was somewhat below the long-term trend, that of oilmeals was somewhat above trend. This divergence reflects changes in the pattern of output discussed below.
The developing countries increased their output by 6 percent for oils, and by 5 percent for oilmeals. This accounted for the entire expansion in world production of oils, and two thirds of the expansion in oilmeals. The Far East was again the main growth area for production of oils, with an increase of 8 percent, mainly in India, Indonesia and Malaysia. Oilmeal output grew by 3 percent in this region. In Latin America, a further sizeable expansion in Brazil was partly offset by a fall in Argentina and the region's output rose 3 percent for oils and 6 percent for oilmeals.

For tree crops, which are produced throughout the year, calendar year production for the second year show is used.
In the developed countries, the substantial increase in the soybean crop, with its high oilmeal content, was reflected in a 3 percent expansion in oilmeal output. In contrast, oil output fell by 3 percent as the increase in soybeans was more than offset by declines in other oilseeds with a higher oil content. Unfavourable weather depressed yields in most producing areas excepting the United States. Lower yields were compounded by the negative impact on plantings of unsettled economic and social conditions in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR and by the reforms of the EC CAP.
Trade growth halted in 1993
The long-term expansion of the quantities of oils and oilmeals entering international trade seemed to have come to a halt in 1993, with trade in oils stagnating and that in oilmeals declining. There was a further large reduction in imports of both groups of commodities into Eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR, particularly the Russian Federation, reflecting changes in levels of both demand and of supplies in these countries. In the EC, with lower domestic production of both oils and oilmeals, imports of oils were estimated to have increased somewhat whereas those of oilmeals were reduced owing to a decline in demand in the second half of the year. India reduced imports of oils following increased domestic production. Foreign purchases by the United States rose, especially of coconut and palm oils which were attractively priced in 1993. Oil imports into China also rose as did Mexico's following reduced domestic output. Pakistan's purchases of oil on
concessional terms contributed to a substantial increase in imports.
Although the volume of trade failed to grow, its value was expected to have increased reflecting higher international market prices, especially during the second half of the year.
Crop specific changes - no overall pattern in 1992/93
The larger output of oils and oilmeals in 1993 was on account of increased production of soybeans, groundnuts, copra and oilpalm products, while there was a fall in production of cottonseed, rapeseed, sunflowerseed, and olive oil.
World soybean production rose by 9 percent to 117 million tonnes in 1992/93, a new peak. In the United States, the crop was 11 percent larger due to record yields on slightly expanded area. Among the other main crops of the northern hemisphere, those of China and India were favoured by good weather. China's output recovered by 6 percent after the setback of the previous year, while that of India rose by a dramatic 37 percent with a rapid expansion of plantings being aided by policy incentives and attractive market prices. By contrast, the harvest in the EC was 24 percent down as plantings were affected by the disincentives introduced with the new oilseed regime and unfavourable weather reduced yields. In the southern hemisphere, Brazil's harvest rose 19 percent to a new record after farmers expanded plantings and fertilizer use in response to greatly enlarged proceeds from the 1992 crop and increased subsidization of credit. In Argentina, the harvest was 3 percent smaller as
a fall in yield, due to unfavourable weather, more than offset an increase in plantings.
The world groundnut harvest expanded in 1992/93 by 4 percent to 24.2 million tonnes (unshelled). India's bumper crop was 22 percent up on the previous year's drought-affected harvest reflecting an ideal monsoon production season and policy incentives. There was also a substantial recovery in Sudan. By contrast, production fell in some major exporting countries, including China and Senegal, because of drought, as well as in the United States and Argentina, because of reduced plantings.
World copra production rose 8 percent partly recovering from the drought-affected level of 1992. The recovery was particularly marked in the Philippines reflecting the lagged effect of beneficial rains in 1992.
World output of oilpalm products expanded again in 1993, by more than 10 percent, reaching a new peak. Production of palm oil was 14.3 million tonnes and that of palm kernels 4.2 million. In Malaysia, output was up 13 percent partly because of expansion in the area of mature palms but mainly because yields increased from the low levels of 1991 and 1992 when the palms were "resting". In Indonesia there was a further sharp expansion in area, and production rose 17 percent.
Among the oilseeds for which world production fell, the main one was cottonseed. Its output was 13 percent down in 1992/93 partly due to reduced plantings in a number of countries where unattractive lint prices prevailed, including in the United States. A 21 percent fall in China was mainly attributable to lower yields caused by drought. Production in the countries of the former USSR was estimated to have fallen 17 percent due to reduced plantings and unfavourable weather.
Rapeseed output fell 8 percent to 26.3 million tonnes. The largest reduction was in the EC stemming from the introduction of the new oilseed regime and other CAP reforms. Other notable reductions in 1992/93 were in Canada where adverse weather reduced planting and in India, due to insufficient moisture. By contrast, China's crop was 3 Percent larger despite some cut-back in plantings.
The world sunflowerseed harvest contracted by 4 percent to 21.6 million tonnes in 1992/93. Reduced plantings led to a fall of 28 percent in the United States and of 20 percent in Argentina where, in addition, unfavourable weather reduced yields. Weather also curtailed yields in the EC, where the harvest was 4 percent lower despite an increase in area sown. Smaller reductions also occurred in China and the countries of the former USSR. By contrast, there were increases in Eastern Europe and Turkey.
World output of olive oil fell 23 percent on account of a cyclical downturn in production. The fall in Italy was 40 percent, with drought exacerbating the effect of the cyclical downturn.
Among the animal products, modest increases were estimated for world production of lard and marine oils, in contrast there were small declines for butter, tallow and fishmeal.
1994 consumption growth forecast to continue for oils, uncertain for oilmeals
Demand for fats and oils could strengthen somewhat in 1994 should the expected acceleration of the expansion of the world economy materialize. Consumption growth would continue to be most pronounced in the newly industrialized countries. However, effective demand of many large importers would continue to be constrained by foreign exchange shortages. In the countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe, the process of transition to a market economy, and its depressing effect on demand in the interim, was likely to continue in 1994.
Demand for oilmeals was expected to expand as growth in the high oilmeal-consuming pig, poultry and fish farming sectors was forecast in many countries, including the United States, Japan, China, Latin America and the newly industrialized countries of South-East Asia. In addition, there may be a continuation of the tendency, previously confined to the EC, to replace grains with oilmeal/cassava mixes in feed rations in a number of countries. Such an expansion in demand for oilmeals, however, would tend to be dampened by higher prices reducing the profitability of feeding them to livestock. Furthermore, expansionary tendencies were likely to be offset by the expected fall in demand in the EC, Eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR. In the EC, the implementation of the reforms in the CAP for cereals reduced market prices for feedgrains from mid-1993, and further reductions will be effected in mid-1994 and mid-1995. Thus, the oilmeal/feedgrain price ratio rose
substantially, and will increase further, causing displacement of oilmeals by grains in feed rations. Such a tendency would be accentuated in 1994 if oilmeal prices remained higher than in 1993. In Eastern Europe and the countries of the former USSR, the tendency for the livestock sector to shrink, as a result of falling consumption of livestock products and a shortage of feeds, was expected to continue into 1994, although at a reduced rate. Thus, oilmeal consumption in these countries, which account for some 10 percent of the world total, was likely to fall further. However, decline would be slower, should the Russian Federation be able to obtain imports on credit. On balance, oilmeal consumption in these areas seemed likely to fall by 5 percent to 18 million tonnes.
Output in 1994 likely to be less than consumption
World output of fats and oils was expected to increase in 1994 by 2.4 percent, but that of ailments to decline by two percent. On balance world production of oils at the forecast level of 88.8 million tons may be less than consumption with a consequent reduction in stocks of the previous crop and upward pressure on prices. World production of oilmeals at the forecast level of 55.9 million tonnes, could only accommodate an increase of 2.5 percent in consumption in the growing markets of the world, that is excluding those of Europe and the countries of the former USSR. However, expansion in these growth markets averaged 3 percent from the early 1980s. Thus, as in the case of oils, there is the prospect of a need to draw on old-crop stocks in 1994 to supplement new crop production, and of an upward pressure on prices.
Among the products, output of soybeans and groundnuts was likely to contract considerably, in contrast to an expected expansion in sunflowerseed, cottonseed, rapeseed, copra and oilpalm products.
The 1993/94 world soybean harvest was forecast to fall by 4 percent to 112.7 million tonnes. The fall was largely on account of a 16 percent reduction in the United States where bad weather limited the crop to 49.9 million tonnes. Contraction in the EC reflected the disincentives stemming from the new oilseed regime as well as the bad weather. Production increases occurred in China and India where the effects of policy incentives and attractive prices were enhanced by favourable weather. The main expansion, however, was likely to occur in South America. There a larger area was expected to be planted in the fourth quarter of 1993 in response to the higher prices induced by the shortfall in the United States. The combined harvest of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay in early 1994 was forecast to increase by 9 percent to more than 38 million tonnes. Argentina's crop was expected to increase most as adverse weather at sunflower planting time was likely to result in a shift of land
to soybeans, which are sown later.
The world groundnut harvest was forecast to be 3 percent smaller, at 23.4 million tonnes (unshelled). Unfavourable weather affected yields both in the United States, whose crop fell by 19 percent and in India, the largest producer, where the crop was estimated to be 14 percent less than in 1992193 at 7.4 million tonnes. In China, the second largest producer, the crop was estimated to be 9 percent up at 6.6 million tonnes. Increased crops were also forecast for the Sahel region in Africa.
For sunflowerseed, the 1993/94 harvest was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent, with the bulk of the increase taking place in the United States in response to policy and price incentives. An increase was also forecast for countries of the former USSR, as harvesting weather was more favourable than in 1992 and in China, where economic reforms continued to encourage planting of this and other cash crops. Spain's oilseed sector was likely to raise EC production, as it was not yet fully integrated into the new oilseed regime, and did not bear the full brunt of the disincentives. In Argentina a reduced crop was forecast for the harvest in early 1994 as unfavourable weather at planting time prevented farmers from fulfilling their intentions.
Cottonseed production was forecast to increase by one percent to 33 million tonnes. Output in the United States increased by 1.5 percent as the effect of adverse weather was more than offset by an 18 percent recovery in plantings. In the countries of the former USSR the weather was not as bad as in 1992193, and output was forecast to increase, although it would remain below the level of some earlier years. China's crop was forecast to be substantially reduced following a contraction in the area planted.
The 1993/94 rapeseed harvest was forecast to be 7 percent above the previous year's depressed level. Canada's crop, although affected by bad weather, reached a new record, 45 percent above the 1992/93 weather-damaged crop, as farmers increased plantings in response to higher world market prices. Higher prices in India were also expected to result in increased plantings and a larger crop. In contrast, prices in China were down tending to reduce output. In the EC, farmers reacted to the introduction of the new oilseed regime and other CAP reform measures by further reducing the area sown. The reduction was 7 percent after the 5 percent reduction of the previous year, however, with more favourable weather than in 1992/93 output was estimated to be down by only 2 percent.
World copra production was forecast to increase by 3 percent to 4.8 million tonnes on the expectation of a continuation of the recovery which began in the Philippines in 1993 and in Indonesia in 1992.
Global production of oilpalm products was forecast to increase by 6 percent in 1994, considerably less than the above-average growth of over 10 percent in 1993. Production of palm oil was expected to reach 15.2 million tonnes and that of palm kernels 4 million tonnes with Indonesia again expanding its output at a higher rate than Malaysia.
A cyclical upturn in olive oil was forecast to raise production by 16 percent in 1993/94. Little change was expected in the production of butter, lard, marine oils and tallow.
Prices increased in 1993
International market prices for oils and oilmeals reflected the 1993 conditions of supply and demand during the first half of the year but in the third quarter they were more and more affected by the 1994 prospects.
During the first half of 1993, the overall level of prices, as measured by the FAO price indices of international market prices, was slightly below that of the previous year for both groups of commodities. The downward tendency reflected ample overall supplies relative to import demand. There were, however, considerable changes in price relationships within the vegetable oils sector. Thus, with the recovery in export availabilities of coconut oil and the steady increase in those of palm kernel oil, the decline in the price of the two oils which started in February 1992 continued well into 1993. By April, both oils were selling at a discount to soybean oil after having commanded a substantial premium for over a year. The ample supplies of palm oil were sold at competitive prices and gained market share. Soft oils, on the contrary, were priced somewhat higher than in the first half of 1992 reflecting reduced crops in exporting countries in the case of rapeseed and sunflower
oils and, in the case of soybean oil, the reduced demand for the meal which restrained crushing.
From the third quarter of 1993, the international market was heavily influenced by the prospective reduction in the forthcoming soybean crop in the United States and the consequent scarcity of oils and oilmeals during 1994. Prices of soybean oil in the fourth quarter rose to average 25 percent above those 12 months earlier, although the uplift for soybean meal was only 2 percent due to reduced demand from importing countries. The price of palm oil was an exception to the general lift in prices as this oil was expected to remain in ample supply throughout 1994. The overall FAO price index for oils was up 14 percent, in contrast there was a slight decline for oilmeals relative to the fourth quarter of the previous year.

Meat
Most production growth sluggish in 1993
Growth in overall meat production remained sluggish in 1993, often constrained by relatively high prices for feeds and by animal diseases. Production rose in Asia, Latin America and North America, but fell in Africa, Europe, and in countries of the former USSR.
Consumption per caput and trade slightly lower in 1993
Reduced growth in incomes in many major markets depressed demand for meat and in 1993 consumption per caput declined for the first time since 1982. Consumption fell in the developed countries, particularly in eastern Europe and in countries of the former USSR where difficult economic conditions continued to limit households' purchasing power. In other developed countries consumption continued to shift towards poultry at the expense of both beef and pork. In the developing countries, except in Africa, per caput consumption rose slightly with a continued shift towards pig and poultry meat at the expense of bovine and sheepmeat.
Sluggish demand growth and new trade barriers depressed the 1993 volume of international trade.' All meat categories were affected except poultry, for which, however, growth slowed down considerably.
Overall, increases in international meat prices in 1993 compensated for the contraction in volumes so that global meat export earnings remained virtually unchanged. Preliminary indications were for a faster growth of global meat production in 1994.
International trade in meat products was likely to recover in 1994, owing mainly to prospects for faster expansion in pigmeat and sustained growth in poultry meat sales.
Poultry meat
World poultry meat output maintained the fastest momentum among the various categories of meat. Production in the United States reached a new record. It increased slightly in the EC, but stagnated in Japan influenced by rising production costs. In countries of the former USSR shortages of feeds and veterinary products continued to constrain output. In contrast, fast growth was reported again in China, although rising feed costs tempered the pace of expansion. There was a more modest increase in Thailand, limited by increasing land and labour constraints. Output also rose in Latin America, where greater protection to the sector was provided through more restrictive import policies.
Unlike the other meats, trade in poultry was estimated to have expanded in 1993, albeit at significantly lower rates than in previous years. EC imports rose modestly; in July, variable levies were reduced in parallel with intervention prices for cereals. Purchases by countries of the former USSR, made mostly under concessionary terms, fell. Shipments to Canada, Japan and Poland also declined. In Poland, the decline followed the introduction of a minimum tariff in May. Among the developing countries, larger imports were recorded in Egypt, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and China. However, many governments, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, imposed higher import duties or more stringent veterinary restrictions to constrain imports and thus protect their domestic poultry sector. Exports from the United States reached a record in 1993, as Strong consumer preference for breast meat continued to enable the export of dark cuts at relatively low prices. Increased overseas
sales were also made by Brazil, China, the EC and Thailand.
World prices of poultry products continued to fall in 1993 reflecting productivity gains in the United States, the leading exporter, and keen competition on international markets.
Prospects for world poultry meat production were for continued fast growth in 1994, with expansion in most regions. However, a further contraction was expected in some countries of eastern Europe and the former USSR.
International trade in poultry meat was forecast to accelerate in 1994, stimulated by rising import demand of Argentina, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to be met by larger exports from Brazil, China, and the United States. Prices for poultry meat could continue their downward trend, reflecting abundant supplies and import restrictions.
Pigmeat
Global pigmeat output stagnated in 1993 reflecting a continued fall in the developed countries and much diminished growth in the developing countries. Prospects in the United States indicated a small contraction in output. By contrast, production expanded in the EC as a result of herd retention in 1992 which was associated with buoyant prices and expectations of cheaper feed costs. The subsequent glut drove producer prices down and prompted the reopening of a EC Private Storage Aid scheme in 1993. Production fell in most eastern European countries under the effects of rising feed prices. Growth in China slowed down considerably, breaking a long-term trend, and reflecting a massive elimination of animals following outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). In Nigeria production expanded considerably seemingly as a result of increased supplies of cassava feed.
Preliminary estimates on world trade in pigmeat indicated a small decline in 1993. This mirrored reduced imports by Japan and Mexico, whereas shipments to the countries of the former USSR probably remained close to the reduced 1992 level. By contrast, relatively high domestic prices in the United States prompted an increase in imports. Amongst the exporters, the main decline was in shipments from the United States and China. By contrast, sales from the EC rose, owing mainly to larger exports to the United States and to Countries of the former USSR, the latter supported through special export refunds which were at least twice as high as those targeted to other destinations. The decline in pigment supplies in major exporting countries supported pigmeat export prices, a tendency which was reflected in a reduction in most EC export refunds.

Animal numbers in the CIS (the former USSR excluding the Baltic States) fell considerably between January 1990 and January 1993, according to the CIS Statistics Committee. The number of poultry in the CIS fell by 17 percent, pigs by 21 percent, cattle by 3 percent, and sheep by 10 percent. The reduction in inventories was especially pronounced in countries affected by civil strife including Armenia and Azerbaijan. One of the principal factors behind these trends was the steep increase in feed prices which especially affected the pig and poultry sectors. In addition, sales of livestock products were depressed by a deterioration in real disposable income since 1991 and by the removal of retail price subsidies. The changes were reflected in a squeeze on profit margins as the prices of livestock feeds increased far more than product prices. In the Russian Federation, for example, mixed feed prices increased 16-fold while those for livestock products increased but 6-fold during
1992. The impact on producers of these changes was moderated by the reintroduction of price subsidies in April 1992, and their doubling in July 1992, on livestock products sold to the Russian state sector. The financial burden of these subsidies was shifted from the federal to regional budgets in December 1992. While some regions in the Russian Federation have maintained subsidies to livestock production, others have discontinued them which led to the reintroduction of intra-regional trade controls in 1993. In late 1993, the Russian government approved a resolution to withdraw the 30 percent subsidy on compound feeds paid to large livestock enterprises.
The large specialized livestock concerns in countries of the CIS continued to reduce their inventories in 1993. From January 1993 to January 1994, pig numbers fell by 13 percent, cattle by 9 percent and those of sheep and goats by 11 percent. However, a large part of the reduction resulted from massive livestock sales to the household farm sector which had better access to feed supplies. Yet increased production by private small farms and cooperatives was outweighed by contraction in the state and collective sector. Overall output fell in 1993, for meat by 8 percent, milk by 2 percent and for eggs by 8 percent.
In the Russian Federation there have been signs of stabilization in the sector. During the first quarter of 1993, prices for livestock products rose faster than input costs and in the first three quarters, milk yields per cow improved by 1 percent and cattle daily weight gains by 2 percent. Feed availability per animal unit also rose. Nonetheless, profitability continues to be low and the course of livestock production in countries of the former USSR will depend on the maintenance of government support to the sector. The contraction in output was likely to extend into 1994 and beyond unless demand recovered or cost per unit of product were reduced by substantial improvements in productivity. Reduction of governmental financial assistance to the sector would further tighten the squeeze.
^1 The CIS plus the Baltic States.
World production of pigmeat was forecast to regain some momentum in 1994. Production increases were expected in Brazil, following enlarged harvests of soybeans and grains there, and in China, Pork output was also likely to rise in the EC reflecting increased animal numbers and lower feed prices. World pigmeat imports were anticipated to rise in 1994, owing mainly to larger purchases by Japan, Mexico and the United States, to be met by greater exports from Brazil and China, and from the EC where reduced domestic prices would stimulate exports. However, the possibility of further outbreaks of animal disease in EC member countries and in China could constrain exports.
Meat: international prices
Little change in international prices for pigmeat was anticipated.
Bovine meat
In 1993 global bovine meat production declined slightly for the second consecutive year. In the United States, output remained stable as weather-related losses incurred in the first quarter were offset by large productivity gains later in the year. In the EC output declined substantially reflecting reduced cattle numbers and large exports of live animals which were stimulated by higher export refunds. In eastern Europe and in the countries of the former USSR reduced cattle numbers and rising feed prices again resulted in lower beef output, however, the rate of decline was less than in 1992. In Oceania, by contrast, higher production was anticipated. Output also increased somewhat in the developing countries mainly reflecting an expansion in Asia, particularly in China. Output was stable in Latin America and the Caribbean, while in sub-Saharan Africa slaughter production was down as cattle were not only reduced in number by the 1992 drought but were also retained for
rebuilding the depleted herds. However, in a number of countries in North Africa and the Near East production was sustained by large imports of live cattle.
World trade in bovine meat fell in 1993, influenced by increased protection of some major markets which outweighed liberalization elsewhere. Purchases by the United States, the world's leading buyer, were lower reflecting the reduction in the volumes allowed under the Meat Import Law and the Voluntary Export Restraint Agreements (VERAs) with Australia and New Zealand. In addition, Canada reacted to an upsurge of beef imports in the first quarter of 1993, by imposing an annual tariff quota on imports from countries other than the United States. Purchases by countries of the former USSR were also down. New duties were imposed by Mexico at the end of 1992 reducing imports in 1993. In the Republic of Korea the Government sustained producer prices by withholding imported supplies from the market. EC imports increased slightly. Purchases by Japan also continued to rise, favoured by a lowering in import tariffs from 60 percent to 50 percent in April, the last reduction agreed under
the market liberalization programme. Larger imports also were made by other countries, including China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. Among the suppliers, Canada and New Zealand increased exports. In contrast, shipments were reduced somewhat from the United States, because of reduced exportable supplies, and from Australia, reflecting more restricted access to North America and Mexico. Beef exports from the EC remained close to the high levels of previous years, although this was associated with much larger sales of live cattle. Bovine meat shipments from Argentina and Brazil were also reduced.
Higher prices were obtained in 1993 for bovine meat shipped from Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) free areas to the world's largest beef importer, the United States, reflecting reduced production there in the first half of the year and a cut in imports under the VERAs with Australia and New Zealand. However, the reaction in Oceania to the narrowing of the North American market was to divert supplies to Asian countries, particularly Japan, leading to lower prices there. At the same time, prices of beef from FMD areas were under downward pressure owing to competition from EC exports reflecting the level of export refunds. The EC stocks of intervention beef were notably reduced as inflow was considerably cut back by the imposition of more restrictive conditions on intervention buying in 1993.
No change in bovine meat production was forecast for 1994 with increases in North America, the EC and the Far East offsetting a contraction in most other regions, particularly in eastern Europe, countries of the former USSR and Oceania. World imports of bovine meat were expected to remain close to the reduced level of 1993. The restrictions on shipments to Canada and the United States were anticipated to continue. However, the ensuing decline in imports could be offset by larger purchases by Japan and the Republic of Korea, which recently raised its beef minimum import quota. On the export side, shipments from Australia were likely to fall as herd rebuilding was expected to reduce export availabilities. By contrast, sales by the United States and Latin American countries were forecast to rise. EC exports could also increase as production recovered and especially were restrictions on intervention purchases to be maintained. A continuation of restrictive import policies was
expected to affect the international market in 1994. However, unlike 1993, record beef output in North America was anticipated to depress prices of exports to this market and limit the impact of reduced access to the region in 1994. At the same time, larger exportable supplies in FMD-free areas could also result in lower prices to Asia. Prices of beef from non FMD-free areas also could fall, particularly should the EC raise export in an attempt to prevent stocks increasing.
Sheepmeat
A small decline in world sheep and goat meat production was estimated for 1993. There was a sharp contraction in Oceania: in Australia, as a consequence of the flock reduction which has paralleled the fall in wool prices since 1989; and in New Zealand, reflecting the retention of lambs for flock expansion, Production also fell in the EC where downward pressure on prices was such that aids to private storage were granted. Continued depletion of flocks in countries of the former USSR again resulted in reduced output. In Africa, production was reduced by a decline in breeding flock numbers. In contrast, the removal of interprovincial trade controls in China fostered production, particularly as mutton was reported to be sold at a Premium in major cities.
Smaller availabilities of sheepmeat for export from Oceania in 1993 brought about a contraction in global trade. In the Near East enlarged imports of bovine meat and live cattle at attractive prices affected trade in sheepmeat, depressing volumes and prices. EC imports, the bulk of which is limited under a VERA with New Zealand, remained largely unchanged. The VERA, and reduced production in the EC increased prices in this trade.
Sheepmeat production was forecast to rebound mainly owing to an expected recovery in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the Far East. International trade in sheepmeat was likely to change little in 1994, although exports from Oceania were forecast to be slightly higher than in the previous year. Reduced production in the EC and the VERA with New Zealand could again trigger increases in prices to the Community.

Milk and milk products
Production slightly lower
World output of milk from cows and other livestock was tentatively estimated at 518 million tonnes in 1993, 1 percent lower than the previous year, reflecting lower output in the developed countries. In the developing countries, production rose 3 percent to 173 million tonnes.
Contraction in the former USSR continued
In the former USSR, milk production dropped by 11 percent during 1992 and was estimated to have fallen by a further 9 percent in 1993. There was a continuation of herd reduction and supplies of winter fodder and feed were also lower. In eastern Europe production was also estimated to have declined in 1993, by an average of 8 percent. In a number of these countries, higher farm-gate prices were outpaced by rising input costs; and, as a consequence of the reduced profitability of milk production, cow numbers declined.
For most other developed countries, milk output was anticipated to be maintained during 1993. Productivity gains served to offset the continuing decline in total dairy cow numbers. In the EC, January to June milk deliveries were in line with those of the previous year and overall production was expected to remain at the same level as in 1992. Output was also stable in other Western European countries. In Japan, with a government programme to cull dairy cows, production was contained at a level slightly above that of the previous year.
In North America, production of milk was slightly lower in both Canada and the United States. Canadian output declined as production quotas were reduced in line with lower overall consumption of dairy products. In the United States, production was expected to be just below the previous year's record output of 68.8 million tonnes, when exceptionally favourable weather conditions resulted in a higher than average yield. In Oceania, production grew in both Australia and New Zealand due to favourable weather conditions and investments to increase productivity.
Milk output in the developing countries expanded
Amongst the developing countries, fastest growth was forecast for the Far East, where production was expected to rise by 4 percent. In India, the largest producer among the developing countries, a 4 percent expansion in output was anticipated as a result of improved yields, stemming from genetic improvements and favourable pasture conditions. The increased involvement of private firms in dairy processing, after the easing of government regulations affecting access to the sector was reported to have led to higher producer prices in some areas. In China, milk output grew by 6 percent in 1992, and a similar increase was forecast for 1993; however, there was a possibility that higher feed grain prices might restrain growth.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, a further expansion of about 2 percent was forecast. Higher producer prices, following the abolition or reduction of government controls, combined with favourable weather conditions, were forecast to stimulate production in several countries including Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. In Colombia, production was expected to recover from the reduced, drought-induced, level in 1992. In Brazil production was expected to be lower in 1993, due in part to a fall in consumption following the decontrol of, and subsequent rise in, retail prices in 1992. In Venezuela, the high cost of imported feed was expected to continue to contribute to lower production.
In African developing countries, aggregate production in 1993 was forecast to remain at a similar level to the previous year. Several countries continued to show steady growth in output, but decline was anticipated in countries of southern Africa where herds were reduced and feed prices increased by the previous year's drought. In some countries, higher feed costs, combined with reduced controls on milk prices, resulted in much increased consumer prices. In the case of Zimbabwe, these caused a subsequent contraction in consumption and excess milk supplies had to be converted into skimmed milk powder for storage.
Consumption linked to income levels
In a number of developed countries the trend towards lower consumption of milk fat, especially butter, continued with consumers switching to low fat milk and dairy products. However, in the developing countries, per caput consumption of milk and dairy products while lower, averaging 36 kg per caput compared to 200 kg per caput in the developed Countries, is rising due to increased incomes. in several countries, higher demand stimulated production and, in some, resulted in higher levels of imports.
No increase in trade, some prices drifted downwards
World exports in 1992 were 55 million tonnes in milk equivalent, 6 percent higher than the previous year. For 1993, no increase in the overall level of exports was foreseen. The demand for cheese was expected to result in higher exports at sustained prices. Smaller increases in the export volumes of butter and ghee, and whole milk powder, were anticipated.
Skim milk powder prices
As regards butter, the members of GATT's International Dairy Arrangement were granted a derogation in June 1993 to export to countries of the former USSR up to 50 000 tonnes of butter per member at below $1 350 per tonne, the minimum price under the Arrangement. Lower exports were expected for condensed milk and skimmed milk powder.
For dairy products as a whole, exports accounted for 11 percent of global output of milk and milk products. Even if the substantial intra-EC trade is excluded, the EC continued to be by far the largest exporter, with Oceania in second place and North America in third, On a product by product basis, however, Oceania exported more butter and ghee than the EC and was forecast to raise shipments in 1993 of all its major export commodities with the exception of skimmed milk powder. In the United States, the increase in funds allocated to the Dairy Export Incentive Programme (DEIP) in recent years has led to growing North American exports of butter and skimmed milk powder. In the first six months of 1993, exports under this programme were 23 percent higher than in the same period in 1992.
Countries of the former USSR, taken together, continued to be the largest importer of butter, although the bulk was food aid or purchases on concessionary terms. This market represented a particularly important outlet for surplus stocks as elsewhere demand for butter was stagnant. Japan consolidated its position as the leading importer of skimmed milk powder and cheese, while its butter imports remained depressed due to above average domestic production. Oil exporting developing countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela, Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia were also active buyers in 1993. In Brazil, reduced funding for government-operated feeding programmes was expected to lead to diminished imports, while in Colombia the recovery of production during 1993 led to a temporary ban on imports of liquid and powdered milk in the middle of the year.
In the EC, public stocks remained small reflecting a sustained reduction in skimmed milk powder production in 1993. Similarly, in the United States, with increased exports under the DEIP, there were only limited purchases for public stocks. In the case of butter, public stocks in both the EC and the United States were lower due to reduced output and sustained exports. Additionally, within the EC over 20 percent of butter production was used in a programme of subsidized sales to the baking and ice-cream industries, as in previous years.
Apart from a number of large-scale imports of dairy products made by several countries, including Algeria and Mexico, and some substantial shipments of butter to countries of the former USSR, the international dairy market in 1993 was characterised by sluggish demand for all major products, with the exception of cheese. Prices for milk powders drifted lower during the year, with prices of whole milk powder being more affected than those of skimmed milk powder. New Zealand, in particular, expanded production of whole milk powder in response to lower demand for butter on world markets. International butter prices remained at or near the GATT minimum level.
The value of global exports of milk and milk products was $24 400 million in 1992, of which developing countries accounted for $600 million. In 1993, lower prices for most products during the year and the absence of any significant increase in the volume of exports were expected to result in a decline in the global export value of milk and milk products.
World milk production to decrease further in 1994
Milk production was expected to decline further during 1994 with reduced overall output amongst the developed countries. Production in the EC would depend upon whether or not a proposed reduction in milk quotas of up to 2 percent in the 1994/95 marketing year would be implemented, In eastern Europe and the former USSR the overall contraction experienced since 1990 would probably continue. Production in the non-EC western European countries, Canada and Japan was expected to be stable, while in the United States and Oceania it was forecast to increase.
In the developing countries, milk production was anticipated to show further growth in the Far East, stimulated by rising demand. In addition, price liberalisation could also benefit producers in several Latin American countries. Further, production in southern Africa might begin to recover from the effects of herd reduction during the 1992 drought.
Little growth in international trade was foreseen for 1994, mainly as a result of efforts on the part of the EC to curb production of milk and to reduce the amount of export subsidies, Demand for most products was expected to be maintained; however, the disposal of butter on the international market was expected to continue to present problems and, as a consequence, its price would remain depressed. Prices for the all other major dairy products were forecast to remain at or near their 1993 levels. Finally, a combination of production restraints and consumption and export incentives was expected to preclude any significant rebuilding of public stocks of skimmed milk powder and butter in the EC and the United States.

Cotton
Consumption recovered in 1992/93
Global consumption of raw cotton increased to 18.8 million tonnes in 1992/93 following a decline in the previous year. The rise to a new record level reflected a continuation of a long-term trend resulting from growth in world population and in consumption per head. One influence had been the decline in prices of cotton relative to those of other fibres. The expansion in mill consumption was concentrated in developing countries while processing in the developed countries continued to contract. Mills in China, the world's largest processor, increased their consumption by 10 percent to 4.8 million tonnes, the highest level since the peak of 1986/87. India and Pakistan both increased their cotton consumption in line with long-term trends, although India's consumption had declined in 1991/92. Indonesia, Thailand and Turkey also increased use in 1992/93. They continued to attract new investment in the place of established processors such as the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province
and Hong Kong, which were disadvantaged by higher processing costs.
Among the developed countries, only the United States increased its mill consumption significantly in 1992/93 reflecting new investment in spinning equipment and strong domestic end-use demand. Almost every country in western Europe, and Japan, suffered a loss of processing to lower-cost countries. Mill consumption in the countries of eastern Europe and the former USSR also continued to contract, mainly from the effects of structural changes.
Production declined in 1992193
Average global yields have increased by an average of 2 percent annually over the past two decades. However, in 1992/93, the effects of drought, pests and disease in some countries contributed to a fall of almost 8 percent, the largest percentage drop in yields on record. At the same time, the global area harvested contracted by 6 percent, as producers in many countries responded to the previous season's cut in prices. As a result, global production of cotton declined by almost 14 percent to just under 18 million tonnes in 1992/93, following a record 20.8 million tonnes output in the previous year. Substantial declines were recorded in developing as well as in developed countries. Production in China fell by well over 1 million tonnes, or by 20 percent, as a result of a combination of abnormal temperatures, drought and boll weevil infestation, coupled with the disincentives of increased input costs and, in some cases, delayed payment to farmers. Pakistan's production
contracted by 28 percent, mainly due to an infestation of leaf-curl virus in addition to excessive rain and flooding. Both China and Pakistan had recorded large increases in 1991/92. In India production increased to 2.3 million tonnes in 1992/93, exceeding the previous peak of 1989/90. Production in Latin America and the Caribbean almost halved, with notable declines in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, attributed largely to the impact of reduced cotton prices and increased costs of inputs, including credit. Adverse weather in the United States reduced production by 8 percent to 3.5 million tonnes, but it might have fallen further had the cotton programme not insulated farmers from the depression in international prices. In Uzbekistan, the major cotton producer among the countries of the former USSR, production dropped by 15 percent to 1.3 million tonnes, due to poor weather at planting time and to continued environmental problems associated with the production of
cotton, while production in other countries of the former USSR also contracted.
World trade fell in 1992/93
The volume of world trade in raw cotton contracted by 6 percent in 1992/93. The largest decline in shipments was from the United States and followed a significant reduction in exports in the previous year. This not only reflected contraction in production but also diversion of supplies to stocks under the government's cotton programme. Shipments from Paraguay, Zimbabwe and Pakistan also contracted with reduced production, while those of India and Greece expanded.
Stocks reduced but prices continued to fall As global consumption exceeded production in 1992/93, stocks in August 1993 fell by some 6 percent from levels of a year earlier. This was despite a 25 percent rise in stocks in the United States. Stocks in China, which doubled in 1991/92 to far exceed those of any other country, were reduced only slightly despite sharply reduced production. In the countries of the former USSR, stocks declined slightly but remained in excess of one million tonnes.
Cotton prices, as indicated by the average of the Cotlook 'A' index, declined by 9 percent in 1992/93, after falling by 24 percent in the previous year. This resulted largely from the build-up in stocks associated with high levels of production in the 1991/92 season. The high incidence of barter trade from the countries of the former USSR also had a depressing impact on prices. Export earnings in 1992/93 were expected to be around 25 percent lower than in the previous year, reflecting a combination of lower prices and smaller shipments.
Cotton: stocks/use ratio and price index
Consumption to expand in 1993/94
Consumption of cotton was expected to continue to expand in 1993/94 and could reach a record level of over 19 million tonnes. This growth was expected in response to decreased prices, economic expansion in some markets, and increased world population. However, consumption of other fibres was also expected to increase, and therefore gains in market share by cotton were expected to be slight. The growth in mill consumption of cotton was likely to be concentrated in developing countries, including China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Brazil. The Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province and Hong Kong were expected to continue to lose cotton processing to other countries in the region with lower costs. India and Pakistan were also likely to expand their levels of processing in 1993/94. Consumption in the United States was expected to expand because of new investment in mills, and eastern Europe could show some recovery following a number of years in which
consumption declined. In other developed countries, including those in western Europe, those of the countries of the former USSR and Japan, mill consumption is expected either to decline or to remain unchanged in 1993/94.
Production to recover
The area sown to cotton may contract further in 1993/94, but if yields return to their preceding levels, a 3 percent expansion in production would be expected. Production in Pakistan is expected to recover from the low yields of 1992/93, but in China it is likely to decline further under the continued impact of reduced producer returns and pest infestations. Dry conditions could depress production in India. In some Latin American countries, notably Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, prices paid to producers were increased under administrative arrangements and some increase in production was expected. Normal weather conditions in the United States would allow production to exceed that of 1992/93. The decline in production in the countries of the former USSR which was evident in recent years could be halted in 1993/94 should weather conditions be suitable. However, in Australia, production may continue to be reduced by drought.
Ratio of global exports of cotton to production
Stocks to contract further and prices to recover in 1993/94
Global end of season stocks are expected to decline by some 9 percent as consumption was forecast to again exceed production in 1993/94. Under these circumstances, prices would be expected to recover, and have been forecast by the International Cotton Advisory Committee to average 14 percent higher than in the previous year.
Trade to expand in 1993/94
Increases in production in some major exporting countries in 1993/94 was expected to spur the shipment of 15 percent more than in the previous year and a return to a level. close to that of 1989/90. Exports from the United States were expected to increase to over 1.3 million tonnes, in line with increased production, but will remain well below the levels of some earlier years. Net exports of countries of the former USSR were expected to expand, reflecting a production increase in countries facing static consumption. Shipments from Paraguay were also likely to be boosted by production increases, while exports from Zimbabwe were likely to be boosted by the large stocks accumulated in 1992/93. The global value of cotton traded is likely to increase significantly as both volumes and prices of cotton were expected to increase in 1993/94.
Prospects for 1994/95
Anticipated developments for the 1994/95 season point to production again expanding at a slower rate than consumption, under the continuing influence of reduced world prices during recent years. Thus stocks would be expected to contract further, laying the foundation for increases in prices. It has been proposed in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations that the Multi-Fibre Arrangement should be brought within the GATT rules and, to that effect, that quotas should be replaced by tariffs which would be progressively reduced over a 10 year period, This would facilitate an expansion of trade in cotton manufactured items and, as a consequence, in raw cotton. It is unlikely, however, that any substantial effects would be apparent in the next few years.
New edition of the World Apparel Fibre Consumption Survey
In the late eighties, per caput consumption of all fibres: cotton; wool; flax; cellulosic and synthetic fibres, rose more rapidly in the developing than in the developed countries. Between 1987 and 1989, global fibre consumption rose by about 4 percent per caput, while in the developing countries it rose by more than 6 percent. Among the developing countries, the Latin American region had the highest per caput fibre consumption.
The market share of cotton declined a little at the end of the eighties, from almost 49 percent in 1987 to 47.5 percent in 1989. This loss of share was concentrated in the developing countries and was the result of consumption of synthetic fibres growing faster than cotton. Consumption of cotton, nevertheless, expanded modestly over this period.
These data come from the fifth edition of FAO's World Apparel Fibre Consumption Survey which was published recently. This document provides data on mill consumption of fibres, trade in textiles and clothing, and end-use consumption of cotton, wool, flax, cellulosic fibres and synthetic fibres. It contains details for 133 countries and 26 regions and subregions for the years 1987, 1988, 1989 and, for developed countries, 1990. Levels of consumption per caput are also given, to provide a basis for making comparisons between countries.

Jute, kenaf and allied fibres
Prospects for another small crop in 1993/94
World production of jute, kenaf and allied fibres was forecast to decline by 6 percent to about 3 million tonnes in 1993/94. Sharp reductions in production in Bangladesh and India would more than offset some increases in China and Thailand. The main reasons for this decline were the late arrival of the monsoon and an area reduction reflecting diminished producer prices and prospects compared to alternative crops. Production in Thailand recovered slightly from the previous season's greatly diminished output while in China, the third largest jute producing country, production was likely to recover further. with increased domestic demand.
Fibre stocks remain adequate
Despite the low level of production for the second consecutive year, supplies were likely to be adequate in 1993/94 as a result of relatively large stocks at the beginning of the season. Moreover, recessionary economic conditions were expected to continue to dampen recovery in demand for jute fibre and products in some markets.
Jute: Fibres prices and hessian stocks and prices
Exports of fibre continued to decline in 1992/93
World exports of raw jute, kenaf and allied fibres declined in 1992/93 for the third consecutive year. Although global exports, at 348 000 tonnes, were only slightly below the previous year's level, they were 31 percent below the 500 000 tonnes peak in 1989/90. Exports from Bangladesh, the largest supplier to the world market, recovered slightly in 1992/93 but those from India and China fell further. Exports from Thailand and Nepal were maintained. Total earnings from fibre exports fell 16 percent to $97 million in 1992/93.
Product earnings declined despite higher volume
World exports of jute and kenaf products grew for the second consecutive season in 1992/93 in contrast with the contraction in the fibre trade. Exports rose by 2.4 percent to 934 000 tonnes. although they remained below the average level of the late 1980s. A sharp recovery in exports from India accounted for the bulk of rise. There, production and exports recovered with the return to normal mill working following a long strike in the previous season. Shipments from Bangladesh and China rose slightly, while those from Thailand declined. Among individual products only exports of sacking from the major exporting countries increased in 1992/93. The total value of products exported fell slightly in 1992/93 with a decline in many of their prices.
Stocks of jute products in the major manufacturing countries fell from 210 000 tonnes in 1991/92 to 196 000 tonnes in 1992/93. The fall reflected reduced stocks of hessian and sacking in Bangladesh and India, but increased stocks of carpet backing in Bangladesh and India and of sacking in Thailand and Pakistan.
Imports of fibre continued to decline but those of products had recovered in 1992/93
A sharp decline in the imports of the developed countries in 1992/93 was not offset by a further recovery in the fibre imports of the developing countries, which account for about 80 percent of trade. The decline in imports into the developed countries was due to a sharp contraction in Europe and countries of the former USSR which was not offset by a small increase in North America. A considerable increase in imports into Thailand was mainly responsible for the market growth in the developing countries, although India also imported larger quantities in 1992/93. However, consignments to Pakistan, the leading largest importer of fibre, fell due to the closure of some mills.
World imports of products recovered in the 1992 calendar year reflecting a marked increase in developing countries. By contrast, imports into developed countries declined further due to recession and substitution by synthetics. Among the developing regions, an increase in the imports of the Near East, of over 60 percent, more than offset declines in Africa, the Far East and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the developed countries. market losses in North America and the countries of the former USSR negated a recovery in Europe.
Prices of jute fibre and most products remained depressed
The decline in export prices of raw jute since 1990/91 continued through the 1992/93 season. The average f.o.b price of the representative grade of raw jute, BWD grade from Bangladesh ports, fell by 22 percent to $277 tonne in 1992/93. Depressed import demand was responsible for this fall. Export prices of kenaf, however, remained stable at relatively high levels, because of scarcity of supplies. The f.o.b. price for Thai "A" grade in 1992/93 was $361 per tonne.
Annual average export prices of jute products declined in 1992/93 except those of carpet backing from India and yarn from Thailand. Although prices of carpet backing from India were 11 percent up in 1992/93, quotations in July 1993 were well below those of 12 months earlier.
Price outlook highly dependent on crop prospects for 1994/95
The reduced production of jute, kenaf and allied fibres in prospect for 1993/94 compared with mill. export and other requirements indicated a decline in stocks. The mid 1994 stock levels were forecast to be unusually low. Price developments in the latter part of the season would therefore be particularly sensitive to prospects for the 1994/95 crop. Should grower prices remain depressed during the season or the weather be adverse, global fibre production may decline. This, combined with diminished stocks, could destabilize prices and scale down the markets for jute fibre and products.

Hard fibres
Sisal and henequen: a marked recovery in prices in 1993
World output of sisal and henequen fell below 350 000 tonnes following the decline of 1992. This continued the long term decline to the lowest level for decades. The contraction reflected a drought in Brazil which reduced production by 23 percent to 150 000 tonnes in 1993. In Africa, the other major sisal producing region, producers responded to the more remunerative prices of 1993, and their output rose 13 percent to 87 000 tonnes in 1993. Kenya and Tanzania increased their production by close to 20 percent. Expansion in China was reported, and production may now be around 40 000 tonnes annually. In Mexico. the henequen industry continues to be affected by the cessation of subsidy payments and production remained static.
Reduced production, evident from late 1992, was reflected in international prices for sisal fibre which rose in 1993 to levels close to those of 1991. Between October 1992 and mid-1993 quotations for East African 3L fibre rose from $470 to $690 per tonne and for UG from $440 to $620 per tonne. There was, however, some decline later in the year. Brazilian fibre, likewise, increased in price from as low as $314 per tonne in October 1992 to around $500 per tonne late in 1993. In contrast, sisal baler twine prices declined even further in 1993, especially in the United States which had previously paid prices above those in Europe. In both the United States and Europe, sisal baler twine sold at prices notably below $16 per bale. This reflected strong competition with polypropylene twine. Overcapacity, prevalent in polypropylene manufacturing for some years, drove down the price of polypropylene resin in Europe from Dm 1.5 in 1990 to as little as Dm 1 per kg during most of 1993.
Sisal: Market prices
The lift in prices for fibre in 1993 reflected shortfalls in production rather than increased demand. Import demand for fibre and for manufactures by most countries remained depressed. In particular, there were virtually no sales to countries of the former USSR in 1992 or 1993. and sales to other countries have been affected by continuation of economic recession. In addition, each year less and less sisal is used in haymaking. In Europe in particular, even in 1991 and 1992 when the total consumption of harvest twine expanded, sales of sisal twine continued to decline while polypropylene gained.
In 1993, global exports of fibre recovered by 11 percent and manufactures 3 percent despite the decline in production. In Brazil, stocks were drawn down and shipments of fibre expanded by 30 percent, although shipments of cordage declined a little under the continuing impact of a 25 percent duty on imports into the EC. Export availability in East Africa increased with production, and while Tanzania's sales of both fibre and manufactures expanded, Kenya's remained static. As a result of the expansion in the volume of world trade coupled with revived prices for fibre, the value of the fibre traded increased by 13 percent to $35 million. The value of sisal and henequen manufactures traded, however, declined by 7 percent to $88 million.
Sisal fibre prices likely to decline with enlarged volumes in 1994
The recovery in prices evident in 1993 stimulated producers in Tanzania and Kenya to expand production. Further recovery in production was expected once Brazil recovers from the drought of 1993. Any such increase in the supply of fibre on world markets would lead to falling prices in the absence of growth in demand. However, at the start of the 1993/94 twine season fibre prices were considerably higher than 12 months earlier putting upward pressure on those for twine. Yet, the price increases for sisal twine would be constrained by the depressed price of polypropylene raw materials and twine and the long-term shrinkage of the market for sisal harvest twine.
The volume of fibre traded was likely to increase further in 1994. However, the impact on the value of exports would be reduced by a likely decline in prices. The longer term outlook for exports of sisal is for continuing decline in the market for harvest twine. Any growth is expected to be limited to nontraditional outlets including, perhaps most notably, papermaking. It is, however, likely to be some years before growth in these areas will more than offset the depression in long standing applications.
Abaca: prices remain relatively high
Production of abaca in the major producing country, the Philippines, expanded as producing regions recovered from drought, but this was partly offset by a decline in production in Ecuador. Some further expansion is expected in global abaca production in 1994, in response to continuation of remunerative prices, and as new plantations in the Philippines come into production.
Growth in global demand for abaca for tea bag production and other specialty uses continued in 1993, despite slow economic growth in many major consuming countries. However, total shipments remained static at 49 000 tonnes, constrained by availability. Trade in fibre continued to be displaced by that in pulp. Shipments of pulp from the Philippines to Germany, in particular, have increased in the early 1990s. This trend is likely to continue as costs in the Philippines are lower than in the consuming countries and the government encourages domestic processing. Exports of cordage increased in 1993, but it is not expected that the long term downward decline in the cordage trade will be reversed.
The price increases obtained in 1991 and 1992 were maintained in 1993 reflecting a continuation of increased demand and producers' difficulties in expanding production. However, in the second half of the year prices declined somewhat following a depreciation of the Philippines peso. The global value of exports of abaca fibre and manufactures increased by 6 percent to $87 million in 1993, the result of an increase in the value of products being partly offset by a decline in the value of fibre traded. Should attempts to increase production in the Philippines in 1994 be successful, prices were expected to move downwards and allay producers' fears that synthetics may encroach on the market. The increased level of demand was likely to be maintained.
Coir
World production of brown coir fibre expanded by a further 4 percent in 1993 as a result of diverse trends in the major producing countries. India's production increased by 12 percent, while Sri Lanka's contracted. This continued the pattern of recent years when growing domestic demand sustained India's industry while foreign demand for Sri Lanka's export-dominated production declined. India's production is expected to increase further in 1994.
The decline in exports of coir fibre, mainly from Sri Lanka, continued and was 7 percent in 1993. However, some recovery in prices of twisted and mattress fibre in 1993 offset the lower volume traded and maintained export earnings.
World output of coir yarn increased steadily over recent years to reach 174 000 tonnes in 1993, with an increasing proportion made from decorticated fibre. India's production of retted white fibre yarn has remained stable at around 127 000 tonnes for a number of years, most of it for domestic use. Exports of yarn from India declined markedly in 1992 and fell further in 1993, while those of Sri Lanka, which also fell in 1992, expanded a little in 1993. In total there was little change in the volume and value of exports of yarn. By contrast, the volume and value of exports of coir mats, mattings and rugs from India, expanded further in 1993, following a recovery in 1992. Nevertheless, coir continued to face strong competition from synthetics in its traditional uses. The only long term expansion of demand was likely to come from the expansion of new uses such as geo-textiles or from a revival of demand for traditional products based on the environmental appeal of natural
fibres.

Natural rubber
Slowdown in utilization growth
World utilization of natural rubber increased by 2 percent to 5.64 million tonnes in 1993, half the rate recorded in 1992. This slow growth reflected economic recession, which adversely affected automobile and tyre industries in all major markets, except those of North America and a number of developing countries. Declines were recorded in most countries of Europe and in Japan.
In the United States, consumption of natural rubber increased by 3 percent to 940 000 tonnes in 1993, following a 20 percent recovery in 1992 after declining by 13 percent for two years. The increase in the most recent years restored the long term upward trend interrupted by the start of economic recession in 1990, and reflected higher production of both tyre and non-tyre goods. Demand in Canada also rose. However, the second largest consuming country, Japan, utilized smaller quantities for the second successive year. The recession there affected domestic demand for automobiles, while exports were reduced because of slow growth in several importing countries. In Europe, consumption in the EC declined, reflecting lower demand in all countries except the United Kingdom, which registered a small increase.
In the developing countries, utilization of natural rubber in 1993 increased by 4 percent to 2.8 million tonnes. These countries now account for half of world consumption. The increase in 1993 reflected continued rapid growth in numerous countries in Asia and Latin America, notably China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Brazil and Mexico. These countries used larger quantities of natural rubber to meet increased demand from their expanding automobile industries.
In 1992 global utilization increased by over 5 percent to 5.5 million tonnes. The increase partly reflected recovery in demand following declines in the previous two years. One half of the increase in world consumption occurred in the United States, where the expansion was 20 percent. There were also large increases in India, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. However, in the EC, consumption remained virtually unchanged as increases in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom were offset by declines in France, Italy and other EC countries. Japan utilized smaller quantities following reduced domestic and export demand for automobiles.
Slower growth in production in 1993
World production of natural rubber rose by only 2 percent to 5.75 million tonnes in 1993 compared with a 5 percent increase in 1992. The slower growth reflected depressed prices with smaller increases in Thailand, Indonesia and some other producing countries, a further decline in Malaysia and a downturn in Africa. Despite this slackening in growth of world production, it still exceeded consumption and exerted further downward pressure on prices.
In 1992, global production of natural rubber rose by 5 percent to 5.63 million tonnes, following a 3 percent increase in 1991. Output was greater in all producing countries, except in Malaysia, Nigeria and Zaire, where it declined. Among the major supplying countries, Thailand recorded the highest increase 14 percent, followed by Indonesia, 8 percent.
Stocks rose further
In 1993, there was a small surplus for the third consecutive year, as global output exceeded consumption. World stocks were expected to increase by 110 000 tonnes to reach 1.74 million tonnes by the end of 1993. representing 31 percent of the world annual apparent utilization.
Prices and export earnings declined in 1993
Export earnings from natural rubber declined in 1993 due to the reduced prices and smaller volume of trade that reflected lower demand in most major markets. After some recovery in world prices of natural rubber at the beginning of February 1993, the INRO Daily Indicator Price (DMIP) registered a continued decline thereafter. The decline reflected not only depressed demand but also the prospect of the collapse of the International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) and eventual liquidation of stocks held under the Agreement. From October 1992 to September 1993 there was no buying by the INRO buffer stock manager despite prolonged periods when prices were below the "must buy" level. This inaction reflected an impasse in the INRO council over endorsement of a mandatory 5 percent reduction in INRA II reference prices under Article 31.7 of the Agreement.
In 1992, world trade in natural rubber recovered by about 3 percent to 4.1 million tonnes. This reflected the sharp increase in imports into the United States, and some increases elsewhere, notably in Canada, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom. Increasing import demand also led to a rise of about 16 percent in exports from Thailand, and a recovery in exports from Africa. However, exports from Malaysia declined by 9 percent and from Indonesia by 4 percent. Export earnings of developing countries rose by 5 percent in 1992 to about $3 520 million, reflecting the larger volume of shipments and a slightly higher average level of prices.
Utilization expected to exceed production in 1994
Early forecasts indicated that growth in global demand for natural rubber would probably accelerate in 1994. World utilization was forecast to increase by 4 percent, due to an anticipated recovery in the tyre and non-tyre sector in Japan and western Europe. However, world production of natural rubber was only forecast to increase by some 1 percent, about half the rate in 1993. This slower growth would reflect the prolonged period of depressed prices in many producing countries exacerbated by a further decline in Malaysia. World utilization was expected to exceed output in 1994 and the price of natural rubber was likely to rise somewhat, especially during the second half of the year.

Hides and skins
Decline in output continued
Global production of bovine hides and skins fell in 1993 for the second consecutive year. The 2 percent decline followed lower output of beef in major producing countries. The greatest number of hides were still produced in countries of the former USSR but output there decreased by 2 percent in 1993 reflecting a contraction of the herd. In the EC, a decline in the size of the herd reduced the numbers slaughtered and hide supplies continued to shrink in 1993. In the United States output was expected to rise 1.5 percent in 1993 reflecting a cyclical increase in slaughtering coupled with improved prospects in the domestic tanning industry. This will consolidate its top position as measured by weight of output. In Australia, slaughter and hide supplies fell in 1993 as herd rebuilding continued encouraged by higher beef prices. Brazil remained the leading producer among Latin American countries despite the economic recession which curtailed domestic demand for leather products.
As a consequence, production of bovine hides expanded by only 3.7 percent in 1993 compared with the previous year's rise of 6.7 percent. In Mexico hide output in 1993 expanded slightly following a rise of 3 percent in 1992. Production of bovine hides contracted in Africa as cattle herds had been diminished by severe drought in 1992.
Global production of sheep and lambskins fell slightly in 1993 according to preliminary data. Countries of the former USSR provided most skins despite a decline in output in 1993 reflecting the recent reduction in flock size. Similarly, Australian sheep numbers and skin production shrank considerably in 1992-93 as a result of depressed wool prices and adverse weather conditions. In New Zealand, fewer skins were produced as sheep and lamb slaughter decreased and flock rebuilding continued. The EC and China provided more sheepskins in 1993 from enlarged flocks but this did not offset the declines elsewhere.
Global goatskin production was maintained in 1993 as the steady rise in China was offset by a decline in Africa. There goat numbers were reduced by the severe drought of 1992.
Trade in 1993 fell with reduced demand
Global exports of bovine hides and skins did not recover in 1993 from the decline in the previous year. This reflected depressed demand in the major hide importing countries. However, exports from the United States, the world's largest exporter, rose slightly in 1993. This was despite the continued sluggish economies in major markets in Europe and Asia. However, the United States' share in global bovine hide shipments has fallen to about 27 percent from 33 percent in 1990 reflecting increased domestic demand by its tanning industry. The growth in exports from countries of the former USSR continued in 1993 but more slowly than in previous years. In contrast, exports from the EC fell following a reduction in output and the retention of good quality hides for domestic use. In Oceania lower levels of production constrained exports to their reduced level of 1992. The only developing country to increase exports was Brazil. Previously a net importer it became a net exporter in 1993
as economic recession reduced domestic demand for leather products and domestic tanning activities.
Hides and skins: Representative market prices
Imports of bovine hides and skins in 1992 and 1993 were constrained by depressed demand for leather and leather products. The tanning activities in some importing Asian and Pacific countries continued to expand but imports rose more slowly than in previous years. The Republic of Korea continued to be the world's largest importer of raw hides at a level similar to that of 1992. China's imports rose as lower labour costs continued to stimulate investment in the leather and leather products sector. By contrast, imports by Taiwan Province and Thailand declined due to rising costs and reduced availability of labour. The leather sector in Italy, the world's second largest importer of bovine hides, continued to be affected by severe constraints on environmental grounds and rising labour costs in leather manufacturing. However, imports recovered slightly in 1993 bolstered by an expansion in the domestic footwear industry. In Japan, imports declined in 1992 due to the combined
effects of increased wages and a contraction in domestic demand for leather goods. A further fall was expected in 1993. Imports of eastern European countries decreased in 1993 as the tanning sector faced reduced demand for leather.
Global exports of sheep and lambskins decreased by 5 percent in 1992 mainly due to a reduction in shipments from Oceania and, to a lesser extent, from the countries of the former USSR. The decline, which started in 1990, continued in 1993 but more slowly, according to preliminary data. This reflected reduced demand for double-face sheep skins and sheep leather manufactures in the main markets, notably France and Italy.
The volume of goat skins traded continued to decline in 1993. Supplies for export were diminished by expansion of tanning in the major producing countries of China, Ethiopia and Nigeria.
Prices depressed in 1992, some recovery in 1993
Chicago prices of light native cowhides continued to fall in 1992 reflecting depressed demand for leather and leather products in major consuming countries. However, prices tended to rise towards the end of 1992 and in 1993 stimulated by decreased supplies of hides and skins and modest recovery of tanning activities in the Asia and the Pacific region.
The global value of exports of raw hides and skins increased by 1.5 percent in 1992 to about $4 200 million and was probably the same in 1993. Foreign exchange earnings by the developing countries continued to decline. In 1992 exports of the developing countries accounted for 11 percent of the global value of trade in raw hides and skins. Their share was estimated to have fallen further in 1993 as a result of growing domestic utilization of raw hides and skins. This was assisted by measures to divert raw materials to their tanning industries. Developed countries had most of the trade and earnings by the United States accounted for 30 percent of the world total.
Earnings from exports of leather and leather products by the major developing country exporters declined by about 3.8 percent to a little over $12 500 million in 1992. This was the first decline for ten years. The Far Eastern countries accounted for most of the export receipts as in previous years. Receipts by established exporters, such as the Republic of Korea, Taiwan province and Hong Kong, fell as they faced increased competition from low-wage manufacturers particularly those in China and Indonesia. Latin America's receipts increased, mainly due to the improved quality of leather products exported by Brazil, the largest exporter.
Stagnant demand but reduced supplies in 1994
Demand for leather and leather products and hence for hides and skins, was unlikely to expand given the low rate of economic growth in major consuming countries. However, some revival in the fashion for leather jackets in western Europe and North America might boost demand for leather garments. The leather manufacturing and tanning industries in western Europe continue to be constrained by relatively high labour costs and increasingly severe environmental regulations. Those in eastern Europe are affected by the loss of major export markets. Rising labour costs and the necessity to provide for effluent treatment in some established hide-importing developing countries in the Far East have also eroded margins in leather product manufacture and reduced their competitiveness. By contrast, import requirements were likely to expand in newer exporters of leather goods with relatively low production costs, such as China and Indonesia.
A further decline in global production of bovine hides and skins was expected in 1994. This would reflect lower numbers of cattle, largely in countries of the former USSR. In Australia, increased prices for the beef have stimulated herd rebuilding. As a result, slaughtering and hide output are expected to contract. By contrast, hide production was likely to increase in the United States. sustained by higher consumption of beef. No substantial changes were expected in Latin America. Bovine meat production there is likely to fall as farmers retain livestock as a hedge against inflation.
World output of sheep skins was expected to decline in 1994 in line with a contraction in sheep meat production. In Australia sheep numbers and skin output were expected to fall in 1994 as result of depressed wool prices and prolonged dry conditions during 1993. In New Zealand, supplies of sheep skins would again be held down as breeding ewes were expected to be retained for flock rebuilding. Production in eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR might fall further as restructuring of their agricultural sector continues. Output of sheep skins in the EC was expected to expand slightly.
The prospects of a decline in production and of some growth in demand for high quality leather products would tend to raise prices in 1994. However, a substantial recovery in prices would partly depend on a revival of income growth in the major markets.

Citrus
World production declines in 1993/94, after a record year in 1992/93
World citrus production in 1993/94 was expected to be 4 percent below the record level of the previous season. It would appear that even after this prospective reduction, and barring adverse weather conditions, there may still be too much fruit available to reverse the slump in prices in both the fresh and processed citrus market precipitated by the bountiful supplies of 1992/93. Total citrus production in 1993/94 was estimated at 72 million tonnes, with output in major producing countries expected to decline, in Spain by 13 percent, in Brazil and in the United States by 10 percent, in Italy by 6 percent and in Greece by 5 percent.
Orange production world wide was expected to fall by 6 percent in 1993/94. However, at 52 million tonnes it would still be larger than the crop harvested in 1991/92. Although there was a downward revision in the orange production forecast for the United States, due to an estimated shortfall in California, the expected crop would still be equivalent to that of 1992/93, as the increased harvest in Florida would offset the shortfall in California. New plantings and replanting in Florida during the late eighties continued to reach commercial bearing stage and contributed to this expansion. The forecast for Florida was 25 percent more than the 1992/93 harvest. In the Mediterranean region, the 23 percent increase in Morocco and Israel would not be sufficient to offset declines in Spain (20 percent), Italy (8 percent). and Greece (6 percent).
World output of tangerines was expected to continue to expand in 1993/94, reflecting the increasing demand for easy peelers. Expansion was evident in the forecasts of leading supplying countries such as Spain, up 4 percent, and Israel and Morocco with estimated increases equivalent to 3 percent, offsetting the 11 percent decline anticipated in Italy. In the United States, production response to growing domestic demand for tangerines would result in an estimated 17 percent expansion.
Lemon production in 1993/94 was expected to increase slightly to reach almost 7 million tonnes, due mainly to the 3 percent expansion in Italy. Output in the United States expanded slightly, while in Spain output shrank 23 percent. World grapefruit production was estimated to be reduced by 8 percent, reflecting the 15 percent fall in the United States and a maintained level in Israel.
Trade in juice to expand: fresh fruit to stabilize
The volume of world trade in processed citrus. primarily as frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ), was forecast to rise 15 percent, with expansion of demand in new markets. The recovery of processed product prices would amplify the expansion in the value of these exports. By contrast, the level of trade in fresh citrus fruit was expected to be maintained in 1993/94.
World exports of fresh oranges were expected to fall slightly in 1993/94 to 4 million tonnes. In the Mediterranean, the rise in exports in most countries would not be sufficient to offset the decline in shipments expected from Spain. The percentage increases in exports were high, notably in Italy, 68 percent, Israel, 33 percent, Morocco, 15 percent, and Greece, 9 percent. However, these increases were quantitatively on a smaller scale than the decline in Spain.
Global tangerine exports, in 1993/94, would be close to the level in the previous season. Shipments from Israel would expand by 21 percent, while shipments from Spain, although estimated to decline by 7 percent to 940 000 tonnes, would still be larger than the combined exports from all the other countries. Another expected decline was in shipments from Morocco, down 13 percent.
World lemon exports were estimated to decline 4 percent in 1993/94, as marketing difficulties experienced in 1992/93 would discourage larger shipments. The decline expected in Spain and Turkey would not be offset by rises in Italy and Greece. Global grapefruit exports, however, were expected to rise mainly as a result of larger shipments from Israel.
1992/93: a record year for world citrus production
World citrus production in 1992/93 reached more than 75 million tonnes, or more than 7 percent greater than the record of the previous season. However, demand had not kept pace with this expansion and exports of processed citrus products increased by only 2 percent, in contrast those for fresh citrus fruit declined by 2 percent. Fresh fruit prices remained relatively depressed throughout most of the season. In contrast, those of Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ) fell to their lowest point in early 1993, before recovering somewhat towards the end of the season. The availability of alternative fruits and juices, in particular the record apple harvest in Europe, together with the continued recession in many leading importing countries, exacerbated the market situation.
Measure to redress the balance of demand and supplies were implemented in a number of countries. These measures included the continued grubbing out of areas of marginal production, and the aggressive development of new markets, in particular expansion of the market in Japan. After the lifting of Japan's orange juice import quotas in 1992, retailers there were able to expand the market share of' orange juice using a more competitive supply of consumer packs based on imported FCOJ. Europe's imports of FCOJ also expanded, spurred by price reductions. On the other hand, greatly increased output in the United States did not provoke the expected large reduction in imports.
Abundant citrus crops were harvested in the world's two largest producing countries. In Brazil a bumper orange crop contributed to a 17 percent rise in total citrus output. In the United States, the 32 percent increase in orange production resulted in an estimated 29 percent increase in citrus output. In the Mediterranean region, the overall growth in citrus production was 3 percent. Major increases occurred in Greece, where production recovered from a disastrous season in 1991/92 and output was up by 37 percent, in Morocco by 4 percent, in Spain by 12 percent, and in Italy by 8 percent. Nonetheless, these increases were barely sufficient to offset declines in Egypt by 30 percent, Israel by 12 percent, and Turkey by one percent.
In other major producing countries, a decline in output of oranges, tangerines and lemons in Argentina contributed to an almost 13 percent decline in total production. A similar proportionate decline occurred in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where oranges constitute the bulk of the production. In China, the rapid growth since the late eighties was reversed in 1992/93, when production declined by 16 percent, as unfavourable growing conditions depressed yields. Among the minor producing countries, output in Tunisia expanded by more than 50 percent to reach 281 000 tonnes and in Portugal by 3 percent to 148 000 tonnes while production in Uruguay declined by 12 percent to 245 000 tonnes.
Oranges had the largest share of citrus production reflecting its dominance in fresh as well as processed consumption and trade. World production of oranges increased 9 percent to a record 55 million tonnes in 1992/93. Brazil, with almost 15 million tonnes, and the United States with 9 million tonnes, will process most of the fruit. The expansion in the United States was mainly from trees coming into bearing from replanting and new plantings in the late eighties. In the Mediterranean, Spain and Italy continued to dominate, as large increases resulted in their output totalling 3 million tonnes and 2.2 million tonnes, respectively, in 1992/93. These countries were followed by Greece with an output of 1.1 million tonnes, and Morocco with 831 000 tonnes. Mediterranean countries are the major suppliers of fresh citrus fruit to the European market and offered ample supplies in 1992/93. This, coupled with sluggish demand reflecting economic recession, and a bigger harvest of summer
fruit especially apples, resulted in prices declining throughout the season.
World tangerine output continued its upward trend with the almost 2 million tonnes produced in Japan being by far the largest contribution. Japan was closely followed by Spain with 1.5 million tonnes, with the Republic of Korea (645 000 tonnes), and Italy (515 000 tonnes) further behind. World lemon production, by contrast, declined slightly. to less than 6.9 million tonnes in 1992/93. with increases in the developed countries insufficient to offset declines in the developing countries. Finally, world grapefruit production increased by 15 percent, largely due to the 26 percent rise in the United States to 2.5 million tonnes. Other notable increases were in Israel, up 14 percent to 383 000 tonnes. and in Cyprus, up 18 percent to 120 000 tonnes.
Fresh citrus trade stagnated in 1992/93 and prices tumbled
Global trade in fresh citrus fruit contracted by 2 percent in 1992/93. Germany continued to be the largest importing country mainly for oranges and "easy-peelers" such as mandarins, followed by France. Other major importing countries included the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan and Canada.
Spain continued to dominate exports of fresh citrus, followed by the United States. Spain capitalized on the growing demand for "easypeelers" in major European markets as it increased exports of these varieties by 2 1 percent, contributing to an overall 10 percent increase in its citrus exports. Shipments from the United States were larger by 2 percent, as it recovered market share lost after the 1990/91 freeze in California. In the Mediterranean region Greece as well as Spain expanded exports, with a rise of 30 percent to almost 390 000 tonnes. In contrast, shipments from Morocco declined by 10 percent, as demand for third country imports into the EC, its main market, remained flat. Similarly, exports from Israel and Turkey declined by about 25 percent. Turkey was hit by decreased EC demand for imports from third countries, and by a severe contraction of markets in eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR. Economic reforms in these countries have reduced the foreign
exchange available for importation of commodities such as citrus. In Israel, the fall in exportable quantities was mainly due to the restructuring of both its production and export marketing systems.
Other notable exporting countries mostly increased shipments. Exports from Uruguay increased by 81 percent, South Africa by 13 percent, and Mexico by 6 percent. By contrast, shipments from Cuba were smaller by 74 percent, mainly due to depressed demand in its usual markets. Exports from Argentina declined by 30 percent, mainly due to marketing difficulties in Europe.
Oranges and tangerines accounted for most of the increase in total fresh citrus exports of the developed countries. as output from California recovered from the damage caused by the 1990/91 freeze and Spain increased its exports of "easy-peelers". World lemon exports continued to decline in 1992/93, by 3 percent. Similarly, global grapefruit exports declined by almost 10 percent in 1992/93.
Continued growth in the processing sector but prices collapsed
The global quantity of citrus processed in 1992/93 increased by 23 percent. Supplies of oranges for processing had continued to expand as a result of replanting and new plantings in the United States and the maturity and favourable yields of trees in Brazil. However, demand had not kept pace with this expansion.
Supplies of juice for export in 1992/93 appear to have increased by at least 20 percent, bringing about the near collapse of FCOJ prices in early 1993. These prices recovered a little towards the end of May. This recovery accelerated when it became apparent that the lower prices in the European markets had stimulated sales beyond expectations. An additional impetus to the recovery in FCOJ prices was fear of a complete draw-down of available stocks in Brazil through larger than expected shipments to the United States.
The Brazilian export reference price fell from $1 300 per ton in the second quarter of 1992 to a low of $368 per ton in the first quarter of 1993. The calamitous fall in prices forced structural readjustments in the production sector and, as a result, prices rose noticeably in May 1993 and reached $920 by July. However, prices of fresh citrus fruit remained depressed in all major markets as supplies of other fresh fruit were also abundant.

Wine
Substantial fall in output in 1993/94
Global wine production was expected to decrease by 8 percent to 265 million hectolitres in 1993/94. This was due mainly to a fall in EC output. There output would be under 160 million hectolitres, table wine output failing by 14 million hectolitres and quality wine by 8 million hectolitres. There would be reductions in each EC country other than Greece. In the United States, production was expected to continue to recover slowly, following phylloxera damage, but faces contraction in domestic consumption and strong competition from imports. Further recovery in production was reported in eastern Europe and in the countries of the former USSR. In the developing countries Output was expected to be maintained while Argentina and Chile restructured their industries to expand quality wine production.
Output was up sharply in 1992/93
The 1992/93 vintage increased by 11 percent to a level above that of the preceding year. A major contribution came from France, where almost ideal growing conditions allowed the vintage to recover to some 63 million hectolitres, 54 percent greater than the previous frost-damaged harvest. Recovery elsewhere in the EC was smaller but the Italian harvest was up 5 percent to match that of 1988/89. Over 63 million hectolitres were produced in Italy, including 12 million hectolitres of quality wine, despite the spread of fungal disease in some areas resulting from excess humidity. Over the past decade, the production of quality wine by the EC has increased, both absolutely and as a proportion of total output. The proportion of quality wine in total EC output was 18 percent in 1980/81; by 1992/93 it had increased to 36 percent, a proportion also expected for 1993/94.
Slow recovery continued in the United States where a number of phylloxera damaged vines still had to be replaced. The recovery of the previous year was maintained in countries of the former USSR. In some of these countries there had been a sharp reduction in the area planted following the anti-alcohol campaign, started in 1985. Progress in replacement has been slow, constrained by economic sluggishness and by shortage of foreign exchange, which prevented the replacement of some equipment. In eastern Europe, the Hungarian wine sector faced severe problems following economic transition there and in its major export markets. In addition, the area planted to vines had contracted and it is expected that further losses will occur. The vintage fell 15 percent, to 4 million hectolitres, reflecting the area reduction and, though output in Hungary will vary annually, it is probable that it will remain below 5 million hectolitres in the short term. By contrast, Romanian production
increased by 56 percent in 1992/93. The impetus for this came from agricultural liberalization helped by favourable weather. In Australia production increased slightly with mixed weather conditions that reduced the volume in some areas but was generally positive for quality.
Red table wine prices in the EC
Production in the developing countries increased by 5 percent in 1992/93 to exceed 30 million hectolitres. Almost half was produced by Argentina where recovery in volume has begun following conversion of many vineyards to production of quality wine, mainly for export. The Chilean vintage also increased from the previous frost-damaged output and was of excellent quality. Considerable conversion of vineyards has taken place aimed at boosting exports but temporarily halting increases in volume.
Exports rose 3 percent in 1992
Wine exports rose by 3 percent to 46 million hectolitres in 1992. Over 83 percent of exports were made by members of the EC. mainly selling to other members. Nevertheless, wine was an important export for countries outside the EC with their exports earnings averaging $2 400 million a year from 1988 to 1992. Exports of quality wine have increased substantially since the early 1980s, when they averaged 37 percent of the total, to 46 percent during the five seasons ending in September 1993. Further, in 1992/93, the proportion of quality wine in exports to countries outside the EC was 59 percent.
Exports by Eastern Europe were about half the average of 1988-90 despite comparatively little variation in aggregate production during that time. In earlier years this trade had been between countries in the region, often as counter trade or on a long term contractual basis. The movement away from barter trade and the scarcity of foreign currency has severely restricted these exports. Furthermore, alternative markets, especially those in western Europe, have been difficult to enter. The situation has been exacerbated by the increased excise duties in several established markets aimed at reducing both expenditure of foreign exchange and consumption of wine and other alcoholic beverages.
Exports by the United States remained well above one million hectolitres in 1992 and more than 50 percent above the average for 1988-90. Though still a net importer, the United States wine industry has suffered from declining consumption and a large stock overhang. As a result, exports have been promoted strongly and have displaced France as Canada's largest supplier. Exports by the developing countries were slightly higher than in the previous year but the only major gains were by Argentina and Chile. Both countries have promoted exports strongly and have concentrated on the production and sale of quality wines.
The value of exports in 1992 increased by 9 percent, to almost $9 000 million. The unit value of exports also increased to $1.98 per litre. With prices of table wine in the EC, which guide prices elsewhere, showing little change. or declining somewhat, the increase in unit value reflects, besides currency movements, the increased proportion of quality wine. Concentration on quality production helped Argentina to lift the unit value of its exports from $0.65 per litre in 1991 to $0.78 per litre in 1992 and in Chile to rise from $1.30 per litre to $1.61 per litre. There were also increases for France and Italy.
Imports largely maintained in 1992
The developing countries imported an additional 0.4 million hectolitres, largely as a result of large increases in the import of Portuguese wine by Angola and Mozambique. By contrast, imports by the developed countries fell by 0.8 million hectolitres. The main loss was in eastern Europe, where imports were halved to 0.8 million hectolitres, and in the countries of the former USSR. Imports by the EC, mainly internal trade, were similar to 1991. By contrast, there was an increase of 0.4 million hectolitres in imports by the United States, reflecting additional exports from France, Italy and Chile.
Moderate expansion of trade in 1993
Preliminary indications were for an increase of 3 to 4 percent in exports by the EC and an increase of 10 percent in exports by the United States. On the other hand, imports by the United States from the EC fell by 9 percent during the first half of the year. The strengthening of the US dollar implies that global export receipts expressed in that currency will decline, however, receipts in exporters' currencies should rise reflecting rising volumes, steady prices in national currencies and a continued tendency to export more quality wine.
Price outlook mixed for 1993/94
Following the estimated reduction in EC output its excess over consumption should fall, for table wine from 34 million hectolitres in 1992/93 to 20 million hectolitres in 1993/94 and for quality wine from 16 to 8 million hectolitres. Though stocks will cushion the fall, EC prices of quality wine would tend to rise and non-EC exporters of quality wine could gain from this rise. However, price increases would be constrained by the downward trend in consumption, which has been falling in the EC since 1987/88, and by the underlying potential for increased production. Some countries have attempted to limit production with mixed results, and a continuation of sizeable annual surpluses remains probable. Moreover, prices of table wine remain depressed with EC representative prices in the early part of the 1993/94 season substantially lower than 12 months earlier.

Tobacco
Production increased again in 1993
Production grew 6 percent in 1993. similar to the growth in the previous year. The 9 percent rise in the developing countries more than offset a 3 percent drop in the developed countries. Production in Africa increased by 5 percent, almost wholly due to larger crops in Malawi and Zimbabwe. Good weather conditions in Zimbabwe not only sustained production volumes but also led to a significant improvement in crop quality. Conversely, crop quality in Malawi suffered from poor weather and the reduced price may lead to a fall in plantings in 1994. There was a record crop in Argentina, from a slightly increased area, and a sharp recovery to earlier production levels in Mexico, where the area planted has doubled since 1991. These increases more than offset a slight decline in Brazil. Brazilian growers reportedly intend to reduce output further in 1994 as a result of falling domestic and overseas demand.
Output in the Near East fell by 19 percent mainly because of a steep fall in Turkey. There the planted area was down considerably due to reduced support prices. and yields also decreased. By contrast. output in the Far East surged by 12 percent to approach 5 million tonnes or 58 percent of global production. Most of the increase was in China but future expansion of planting may slow down due to rising costs of production and increasingly attractive returns from alternative crops such as fruit and vegetables.
The largest decrease was in the European Community where output fell by 12 percent on an area reduced by 10 percent. Quota reductions, as part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, were the main reason for the decrease. The area planted also fell in the United States as there was it substantial reduction in the quota for burley tobacco reflecting decreased domestic demand and stronger competition abroad. Minor increases elsewhere were insufficient to prevent output in the developed countries falling to 1.8 million tonnes, similar to the average for 1988-90.
The 1993 increase in overall output mainly reflected that of flue-cured and burley tobaccos. Expansion of these tobaccos in Brazil. China, Malawi and Mexico more than offset lower output in the developed countries. Production of oriental leaf increased 6 percent reflecting a recovery in the countries of the former USSR following the previous drought-induced losses. That increase offset a sharp reduction in Turkey, where prices were unfavourable, and in Greece, following EC agricultural reforms. By contrast, production of dark leaf tobacco declined slightly with pest damage in Brazil and reduced planting in China being only partly offset by an expansion of plantings in India and Indonesia.
Production had also increased considerably in 1992
Tobacco production exceeded 8 million tonnes in 1992. This was more than one million tonnes greater than the average of 1988-90 and reflected the continued expansion in the developing countries where one million tonnes was added to their output in the early 1990s. Expansion in China, which accounts for almost 40 percent of world production, was less rapid than in previous years, some 4 percent. In Africa the rise was 13 percent with production in both Malawi and Zimbabwe responding to the relatively favourable prices of the previous season. In Brazil the increase was 41 percent with a 16 percent expansion in the planted area and substantially increased yields. Increased output in Latin America and the Caribbean almost solely reflected the growth in Brazilian output though the harvest in Argentina rose above 100 000 tonnes. Production in the Near East advanced sharply following expanded planting in Turkey. In the Far East, the 1991 rise in world prices encouraged increases in
production in the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Thailand and, to record levels, in India. These countries accounted for nearly half the expansion in the region with China contributing the remainder.
Production in the developed countries increased slightly in 1992. A small increase in the crop in the United States reflected a slight increase in area. Production in Greece increased by 25 000 tonnes, following a temporary, large increase in area planted, but was insufficient to prevent a moderate contraction in the EC with decreased crops in France, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Output increased slightly in countries of the former USSR but this did not offset reductions in Eastern Europe, principally in Poland and Romania.
Trade growth almost ceased in 1993
The recent fast growth of trade in leaf tobacco slowed in 1992 and seems to have almost ceased in 1993. However, exports by the developing countries were likely to have risen by almost 10 percent to over 1 million tonnes, whereas exports by the developed countries were likely to have fallen 11 percent to just over 0.6 million tonnes, in 1993. These changes are a continuation of a recent trend and reflect agricultural reforms in the EC and increased use of cheaper tobacco by cigarette manufacturers. The unit value of their 1992 imports from developing countries was only 54 percent of the unit value of those from the developed countries.
1992 trade growth slight
Leaf exports increased by 2 percent in 1992 with almost all the increase accounted for by the developing countries, their exports grew 3 percent to account for 59 percent of the world total. By contrast, exports from the developed countries hardly changed. Total exports from the developing countries increased by 29 percent between 1988-90 and 1992. However, regional growth differed widely. Over this period Africa's exports grew rapidly, overwhelmingly from Malawi, up 43 percent. and from Zimbabwe, up 41 percent. Exports of Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 21 percent. Most were from Brazil where shipments surged to over 240 000 tonnes with a bumper crop. In 1992, Argentina's exports also rose to 33 percent above the average of 1988-90 following substantially increased crops in 1991 and 1992. Exports by the Far East increased again reaching a level 56 percent above the average for 1988-90. The expansion in 1992 came mainly from India. but the latter increase was
offset by reduced exports from China, Thailand and Indonesia. By contrast, exports from the Near East fell by 19 per cent from the 198890 average reflecting contraction in exports from Turkey where a small crop in 1991 led to a 44 percent drop in exports in the following year.
Among the developed countries the United States again increased unmanufactured leaf imports more than exports and was a net importer for a second year. The EC was an even larger net importer of leaf. By contrast, the net exports of cigarettes of both markets have doubled since 1988. The share of exports in cigarette output of the United States rose from 17 percent in 1988 to 29 percent in 1992. In the EC the increase was from 26 percent to 38 percent. With the consumption of tobacco declining in the developed countries the industry there has added value through the manufacture and export of cigarettes. However. leaf imports by the United States may stagnate or decline Lis a result of recent legislation limiting the amount of foreign tobacco that can be used in domestically manufactured cigarettes.
Stocks sharply up again
Stocks, which rose to over 6.7 million tonnes at the end of 1992 were expected to rise by a further 0.5 million tonnes in 1993. By the end of 1993 stocks would then be 85 percent of current production, a proportion slightly below the average for 1988-90 but above that for the intervening years. The expansion of production in the developing countries has resulted in a wider dispersion of stocks and relatively high levels in some countries. Stocks in China at the end of 1993 were estimated to be 2.7 million tonnes, twice as large as in the United States and over one million tonnes larger than at the end of 1988. Stocks in Brazil and in India doubled during the same period and Brazilian stocks now exceed 70 percent of annual production. Inventories in the United States continued to decline both in absolute terms and as a proportion of world stocks.
Prices decline sharply in 1993
With strong competition for export sales in 1993, auction prices for flue cured and burley tobacco fell substantially in local currency in Malawi and Zimbabwe. One third of the 1992 unit value was lost in Malawi while Zimbabwe suffered losses of over one-quarter. Early season reports from the United States indicated that auction prices were similar to those fetched in 1992.
The global value of exports of unmanufactured leaf increased slightly in 1992 to $5 856 million. The increase was in the receipts of the developed countries, though volumes exported were virtually unchanged. Earnings of the developing countries fell despite a 15 percent increase in volume. Export earnings of the developing countries were likely to decline further in 1993 as their increased volume were more than offset by reduced unit values. An increase in price was unlikely for most tobaccos as production exceeded consumption in 1992 and in 1993. Some countries are making efforts to decrease production; even so the enlarged stocks and quantitative restrictions on imports would continue to depress the market.

Fishery products
World fish catch stagnates
The 1992 fish catch regained the level of 99 million tonnes reflecting an increase in production by China of 2 million tonnes. In the 1980s marine catches grew constantly rising by almost one third in the decade. By contrast, in the early 1990s, many marine catches have fallen year by year, but inland water production and aquaculture output have increased.
At the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) meeting in March 1993, FAO reported that global fish production from most marine resources and many inland waters had reached or even exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. Overcapacity of world fishing fleets was identified as the main cause of fishery resources degradation. In many high seas areas inadequate management and over-fishing were recognised as the major problems. These factors have been addressed by the International Conference on Responsible Fishing and the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) with implementation of recommendations on responsible fishery supported by FAO.
In 1992 China's catch rose 14 percent from 13 to 15 million tonnes and was by far the largest output in the world. Chile, too, expanded its fish catch by 8 percent. Production in many developed countries tended to decline. The total output of the countries of the former USSR was 44 percent less than the 13.6 million tonne peak reached in the late 1980s. Japan's fishery output also continued to decline reflecting decreased sardine catches and a further decline in landings of Alaska pollack. In addition North American fish production declined by 3 percent due to problems with the cod fisheries in Canada. In 1993, the catch was estimated to have decreased even more as further areas were shut down for cod fishing.
Norway was one of the few developed countries reporting an increase in catches in 1992 and 1993. The healthy cod resource in the Barents Sea was the main reason behind the increase, combined with higher cultured salmon production in 1993. In addition, Iceland's catch recovered rising by a half a million tonnes from the depressed level of 1991.
The global value of the fish trade increased in 1992 reflecting considerably higher prices for the decreased volume of fish entering international trade. The United States continued to be the main exporter of fishery products, valued at $3 600 million. Thailand maintained its second position among fish exporters, though its industry experienced substantial problems in 1992. Its exports increased by 6 percent to $3 100 million. The EC as a group increased its exports, but a substantial share of them were to other EC members and will be excluded from EC export figures in the future. The crisis in the Canadian fishery industry was reflected in its export performance and was one of the few countries reporting lower export values in 1992 than in 1991.
The developing countries as a group accounted for 45 percent of world trade in 1992. The slight increase in overall exports arose from notable increases such as those of China and Thailand being almost offset by the Republic of Korea's 9 percent decrease.
The developed countries accounted for 86 percent of world fish imports. Japan maintained its position as top importer in 1992 accounting for 28 percent of the global total for a value of $12 800 million. The United States, the second major market for fishery products. reported fish imports stable at $6 000 million. In the EC. recession and currency devaluation influenced fish imports and growth slowed to 2 percent. In Italy, imports of fishery products declined in 1992 for the first time after years of continuous growth.
Individual commodities in 1993
Dramatic reports about the reduction in China's shrimp production overshadowed the market in 1993. The drop in China's shrimp culturing was put at 85 percent by traders, though a 65 percent drop seemed more realistic. As a result there was a ready market for white shrimp from Southeast Asia. Black tiger production did not grow, as Indonesia continued to have disease problems. As for wild shrimp, the coldwater shrimp catch was expected to increase somewhat in 1993 over the 1992 level. Production of wild shrimp from tropical waters was expected to be maintained. However, overall shrimp production was estimated to be 50000 to 100000 tonnes below the 1992 level.
Shrimp prices moved upward in all the main markets, as supplies continued to be scarce throughout the year. Traders' margins were reduced as some consumer price resistance was felt at the retail level and the price increase could only be passed on gradually. Even so some traders and consumers were to be expected to move away from shrimps.
Imports of shrimp into Japan increased sharply in the first half of 1993, but in the second half the expansion of supplies slowed and prices moved up. Total imports during 1993 were expected to exceed 285 000 tonnes. Indonesia continued to be Japan's main supplier, despite the problems encountered by its aquaculture industry. Thailand came a close second.
Domestic shrimp landings in the United States were again depressed, and most of the increased demand was met by import expansion. Supplies from Asia expanded in 1993, replacing those from Latin America The EC market was generally static in 1993 as recession overshadowed the business. However, in the closing months of the year there were timid signs of expansion. Prices in Europe moved up for tropical shrimp, especially for black tiger, but coldwater shrimp was in ample supply and prices tended downwards.
In 1993 the aquaculture industry seemed to have reached a point of stability or even decline after years of outstanding growth. The major producing countries reached their peak production level, and most of them have moved into decline. Countries like Ecuador and Thailand were expected to maintain production, while output in other countries, including China, Indonesia and the Philippines, was likely to contract further. In this climate shortages will continue. The shortage of Chinese shrimp would benefit black tiger producers, especially in Thailand where no disease problems have been experienced.
Tuna catches continued to be depressed in all the main fishing areas and prices moved upwards in 1993. Italian canneries paid $1 400/tonne for yellowfin at the end of 1993, which was 40 percent up on the year. Thai canneries too faced a 40 percent price increase for their raw material over the year and skipjack reached $1 000/tonne in late 1993. Canners started to pass on these price increases to their clients. Yet after the years of relatively low and stable prices for canned tuna consumers were reluctant to pay more. Future price developments strongly depend on the outcome of discussion between the Mexican tuna industry and authorities in the United States. If the import ban on tuna caught in the Central Eastern Pacific were to be removed, prices would probably go down again.
There was some discussion among environmental groups of the use of the "dolphinfriendly" logo. Greenpeace, for example, strove to strengthen the scientific content of its approach. It was thus expected that the dolphin issue, which created huge problems for the Mexican, Ecuadorian and Venezuelan tuna fleets, would be overcome soon.
Sales of groundfish in the United States expanded in the summer and autumn of 1993 but remained very sensitive to prices. The groundfish block market in the United States was depressed and cod block prices declined towards the end of 1993. In contrast, Alaska pollack was scarce as fishing stopped in many areas, and prices went up. Earlier in 1993, huge quantities of Alaska pollack from the Russian fleet had arrived in the United States swamping the market.
The EC market continued to be overshadowed by the recession. However, some traders saw signs of expansion especially towards the end of 1993. Early in 1993, the arrival of low priced cod from Russia led to protests by Community fishermen. The EC then enforced a reference price on groundfish species, which helped to stabilize the market, however the prices of cod did not recover during the remainder of 1993.
The most valuable species in the cephalopod group, the octopus, had a rest period in the Central Eastern Atlantic in October 1993. This followed a glut earlier in the year and a meeting of the main octopus producing countries where certain stock protection measures and an unified count system were agreed. Squid prices in Europe continued to decline as those for Thai products were undermined by increased imports from India. The Indian product played .an important role on the French market, while Italy's importers still preferred Thai squid. In contrast, cuttlefish was scarce all through the year and prices moved upwards.
The glut on the salmon market became more and more acute in the closing months of 1993 despite strong pre-Christmas buying. Cultured salmon production was up about 20 percent reflecting the success of the main producing countries in eradicating disease and in raising feed use efficiency. Fish farmers in Norway tried to reduce output by giving less feed to their salmon, nevertheless production was expected to exceed 150 000 tons. Prices of Norwegian salmon fell to $4/kg in November 1993, the lowest for some time. EC farmers of salmon asked the Community to control imports from Norway, by enforcing a minimum import price. This was likely to be introduced in 1994 with prices based on producer prices and import prices over the last three years. Wild salmon was abundant on the market, and prices were around $2.50/kg for the lower priced species. Salmon which used to be a luxury item, is now selling for little more than cod.
The canned small pelagic market was influenced in 1993 by the controversy between Portuguese and Moroccan traders about access to the EC market. Morocco's duty free quota was abolished in 1992 and was replaced by a reduced regular rate of duty of 8 percent, with a further reduction to 5 percent by 1996. Moroccan canners subsequently asked for a substantially lower tariff to meet the increased competitiveness of canners in Portugal and Spain following a devaluation of their currencies. A reflection of the strong competition between Portuguese and Moroccan canners was the notable decline in prices for canned sardine. In the United States the market was stable but canned sardines from Peru, Portugal and Chile replaced those from former Yugoslavia, which used to be an important supplier to the United States.
The major fishmeal exporting countries reported a 6 percent increase in production in 1993. This increase came entirely from catches by Peruvian vessels, while all other fishmeal exporters reported reduced production. Total Peruvian fishmeal production was estimated to exceed 1.6 million tonnes in 1993, the highest output for some 20 years. Only before the anchoveta crisis, in 1971, had fishmeal production been higher. Peru's production became the largest in the world, exceeding Japan's, which declined further to about 400 000 tonnes in 1993. Production in Chile also declined by about 10 percent, as did that in Scandinavia with reduced Danish output.
The ratio of fishmeal to soybean meal prices was only 1.7 towards the end of 1993, down from 2.4 twelve months earlier. Feed producers in Europe and the United States took advantage of this relative decline in prices and expanded imports. In contrast, China, with relatively large stocks, bought less in 1993 than in 1992. The immediate outlook was that feed producers would continue to substitute fishmeal for soybean meal and as stocks in producing countries decline prices of fishmeal were expected to increase somewhat.
Fish oil production increased considerably in 1993 relative to the depressed level of 1992. Peru was the main producer, as it was of fishmeal, and also returned to being a major exporter in contrast to 1992 when it was an importer. In addition, Chile and the United States increased production, while it declined further in Japan where supplies were supplemented by imports.
The ratio of fish oil to soybean prices was 0.75 in late 1993, down from 0.92 in August 1992. Prices of soyoil exceeded $500/tonne in July 1993, their highest level for 5 years. Fish oil has also declined relatively to palm oil, the price ratio failing to 0.89 from 0.93 a year earlier. In addition, an expansion of demand for fish oil was expected to follow the introduction of new products and in the United States it seems that fish oil can at last be used in margarine production. The extension of uses will increase the market for fish oil quite substantially.

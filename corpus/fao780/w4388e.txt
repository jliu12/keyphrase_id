<title>Pacific Rim demand and supply situation, trends and prospects: implications for forest products trade in the Asia-Pacific region. (Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study - Working Paper Series) APFSOS/WP/02</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
The present report has been prepared for the Forestry Policy and Planning Division, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy as a background document for the proposed Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study "The Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector - Towards 2010". The Terms of Reference for the present study fully recognize the extensive body of existing study reports, regional analyses, country reports, and related studies documenting forestry sector status and trends, including outlook projections for likely future developments. The present study does not seek to duplicate this body of information; rather, the purpose of this study is to review, summarize, and integrate the major themes and directions outlined in the existing literature, to identify major determinants of forestry sector developments, to outline a 'most likely' regional scenario to the year 2010, and to propose additional areas of work required for the proposed Asia-Pacific Forestry
Sector Outlook Study.
In undertaking the proposed study, the support provided by the technical officers and staff of the FAO Forestry Department has been critical to the completion of the report. The identification of key analytical studies, the access to the FAO Forest Products Statistics Database and the Forest Resources Information Database, the consultations on critical elements of the study, and guidance and support relative to synthesis of the near-overwhelming amount of descriptive and analytical source information is gratefully acknowledged.
The present study is presented in two volumes. Volume I (Main Report) provides the basic synthesis and information on a Asia-Pacific and Sub-Region basis as set forth in the Introduction. Volume II (Statistical Appendix) provides detailed statistical information at a desegregated Sub-Region and Country level whenever possible. Information compiled by the authors is supplemented by reproduced charts, tables and other forms with full recognition and credit to the original sources. Volume I contains a detailed Bibliography of primary source materials used in this review, together with an extensive listing of Supplemental Sources identified as useful in support of a better understanding of the status and outlook for the forestry sector in the Asia-Pacific Region. While extensive, these listings of reference materials is yet incomplete.
There are also known to exist many additional country studies prepared by individual governments, bilateral assisted national or sub-regional studies, International agency reviews, project formulation documents, internal evaluation reviews, and many academic and scholarly articles and monographs. While it has not been possible to examine and document this extensive information base completely, the ideas and findings reflected in major studies cited here are contributing elements to our present level of understanding.
While every effort has been made to accurately report the themes and findings of prior studies and analyses, and to document primary sources, the interpretation of information by the authors may differ from the original source. Responsibility there for rests with the authors of this report whenever such differences arise. This is particularly important in the formulation of the 'most likely' scenario where the array of outlook projections have been tempered by judgments balancing the differing and often inconsistent methodologies and assumptions used in the source materials.
As reported in this study, there are an almost endless number of 'issues' confronting the forestry sector in the Asia-Pacific region. A matrix format was utilized to screen the general and specific items noted in the literature in order to formulate a comprehensive framework for structuring the presentation and discussion. Judgment was exercised in identifying the major content of the literature reviewed, and the classification of issues is largely judgmental and does not directly reflect the precise or specific terminology used by various researchers and authors. Issues have been necessarily broadened and generalized for the purpose of regional synthesis. Readers are urged and encouraged to consult the source documents for a more complete and detailed understanding of each specific source.
The Asia-Pacific Region is of critical importance to the global forestry sector from both a utilitarian forest products perspective and as a critical component of the world's natural resources and environment. The region is experiencing many significant changes economically and socially, giving rise to increased concern about the stewardship and use of forests. It is hoped that this synthesis will contribute to the formulation and completion of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study in support of the future well-being of those linked to this important sector.

Introduction
Background
Study purpose and structure
The Asia Pacific Region
Background
Forestry in the Asia Pacific Rim continues to receive extensive attention from many perspectives. This region, home to some estimated 3 billion inhabitants as of 1994, and including over 2.8 billion ha. of land, contains an extensive range of land forms, climate, socio-economic conditions, forest types, stages of economic development, and levels of forest sector development and utilization.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has been the primary source of ongoing information about the status of the forestry sector, including the component countries of the Asia Pacific region. In cooperation with the Asia Pacific Forestry Commission, FAO has initiated planning for a two year analysis leading to the completion of an Asia Pacific forestry sector outlook study, "The Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector - Towards 2010".
Prior evaluations and analyses have been undertaken by many organizations, including FAO itself. Periodic publications of global and regional Resource Assessments and the related Forest Products Yearbooks are widely recognized as authoritative sources for forestry sector information. Other primary sources of recent regional analyses have included significant works sponsored or undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank (WB), and the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). Other significant work has been undertaken by the Center for International Trade in Forest Products (CINTRAFOR) at the University of Washington, Seattle. These analyses have been supported by major international consulting organizations with longstanding expertise in the forestry sector.
There has also been significant in-depth analysis and review of individual country forestry situations as components of the Tropical Forestry Action Programme, Master Plan Development projects, the formulation documents for international assistance projects, and individual government studies of national conditions. What has frequently been lacking, however, is a broader regional context for understanding the dynamics of forestry sector developments. In part, this is internal whereby individual countries pursue their immediate interests, aggregations of countries are viewed as either 'developing' or 'developed', as 'tropical' or as 'temperate', as 'importers' or as 'exporters'.
In reality, the Asia Pacific Region is a mixture of all of these components - and more. Diversity is a hallmark of the region, yet the dynamics of the region dictates the need for a more integrated and total perspective if the future of the area is to be understood in a global context. External to the region are other significant 'players' who may be either consumer-markets and/or potentially competitive producers of forest products. In many cases they are both. The future of the forestry sector of the region will be dynamically determined by both internal developments within individual countries and in response to regional and global factors beyond the influence or control of any individual nation.
Study purpose and structure
The proposed Asia Pacific forestry sector outlook study will seek to build upon the considerable information base that exists. At the same time, the dynamics and interdependencies of the diverse forest economies of the region must be-reflected in a broader and integrated framework capturing the essential determinants of sector development for the region as a whole.
The present study has been undertaken an initial effort to provide a synthesis of the major existing information base for the forestry sector within the Asia Pacific region. Major trends are summarized by sub-region within the Asia Pacific Region. Recent developments in the forestry sector are presented by sub-region. Recent analyses covering all or parts of the region have been reviewed with an emphasis on identification of the determinants of past trends and indicators of likely future developments. Where available, outlook projections are summarized and presented. Drawing upon this depth of information, a summary of major 'issues' confronting the region is developed, and a 'most' likely near term outlook is synthesized in qualitative terms.
The report concludes with a brief identification of major areas where additional research and analysis can contribute to a more complete understanding of the opportunities and challenges confronting the region as it seeks to develop and implement sound policies and direction for a productive and sustainable forestry sector. This policy and direction will undoubtedly be as diverse and unique as are the forest conditions and countries involved. What will emerge, it is hoped, is a collective recognition of a common interest and purpose so that the individually determined strategies can be based on a realistic understanding of the broader regional context.
The Asia Pacific Region
Analysis of the forestry sector must necessarily begin with a definition of the inclusive region of study. Previously, major reviews and studies within the Asia Pacific Region have been limited in scope, necessarily focusing on specific sub-grouping of countries. Groupings of countries have included 'tropical' and 'temperate', 'developing' or 'developed', 'importers' or 'exporters', etc. In the present study, the focus is on the geographic region, preserving the obvious diversities of the various sub-regions and individual countries.
The scope of the present study is provided in Table 1. In general terms, this includes China and Mongolia to the north, Pakistan to the west, New Zealand and Australia to the south, and the Pacific Island countries to or near the International Date line to the east. As identified in Table 1, five sub-regions have been identified, based on geographical location.

The present study is integrative and a synthesis of presently available information. It draws heavily on major existing studies. An extensive bibliography of the major sources reviewed and utilized in this report is provided, together with an extended listing of supplemental sources. While extensive, these listings are not comprehensive as to all current literature bearing on the forestry sector of the Asia Pacific Region. Many formal and informal publications and reports were unavailable during the preparation of this report. Many analyses are presumed to exist within the files of individual countries, major international organizations, and consulting organizations, university and research centers, and individual companies and public interest organizations.
Much of the basic resource and trade information derives from the work of FAO through the various component studies of the "Forest Resources Assessment 1990" and the related FORIS database maintained by FAO. It also utilizes the FAOSTAT database for forest products production, import and export statistics, together with the related Forest Products Yearbook. Compilations of information from this source is based on the 1996 update of FAOSTAT with statistics generally inclusive to 1994. Major works utilized in this review include the following:
· The World Bank, "Tropical Deforestation in Asia and Market for Wood", report prepared by Jaakko Poyry, November 1992
· Asian Development Bank, "Status of Forestry and Forest Industries in Asia-Pacific Region", report prepared by Jaakko Poyry, November 1995

Although these major studies play a central role in the present review, numerous additional country, product, or partial reviews and outlook reports have been examined in the course of this project. Country Tropical Forest Action Programs and similar Country Forest Master Plans exist for the majority of Asia Pacific countries and have been referenced where possible. These additional sources are cited in full in the bibliography and supplemental sources list. A comparative listing of primary country coverage in the major regional analyses is included in Appendix 1 (Study Volume II).

Over view of the Asia-Pacific Region
Population and socio-economic status
Land and forests
Deforestation
The Asia Pacific Region, as defined above for this study, is an immense region, covering some 2.8 billion hectares of land area, or approximately 22 percent of the global land area. Stretching from the borders of China-Mongolia with the NIS to the north to the southern tip of Australia and New Zealand to the south, this region covers the spectrum of conditions from northern temperate and boreal through the range of tropical and subtropical zones and back to temperate. From the high plateaus and mountains of Pakistan to the west and extending to the island countries of North Asia and the South Pacific, the Asia Pacific region incorporates conditions of moist tropical to arid and semiarid desert. As would be expected by this geography, the human and social dimensions of the Asia Pacific Region are equally diverse.
Population and socio-economic status
A summary of broad social and economic indicators is given in Table 2.^1 More detailed information for each country is contained in the Statistical Appendix. The largest sub-region in terms of land area is the North Asia region, containing the People's Republic of China with almost 933 million ha. The diverse Oceania-S. Pacific region is the second largest, with over 835 million ha. and dominated by Australia. The smallest sub-region is Continental SE Asia with just over 190 million ha.
^1 Throughout this report, summary tables are provided covering the five sub-regions of the Asia Pacific Region. Whenever possible, detailed companion tables reporting information by country for each sub-region are contained in the Statistical Appendix (Volume II).
Population for the Asia Pacific Region is large and growing. Total Region population was estimated at 3.08 billion in 1990, or over 57 percent of the total global population. According to estimates by the World Bank, the Region's population had grown to almost 3.09 billion by 1994. Annual growth rates exceed 2.0 percent per year in most of the Region's countries (See Appendix Table 2). For the period 1981-90, the Asia Pacific Region grew by about 48 million persons, representing over 56 percent of global population growth.
The population is disproportionately distributed in the Region, resulting in widely differing population densities. South Asia is the most densely populated, with a regional average of some 311 persons per square kilometer. Bangladesh (888.0) and Sri Lanka (266) are the most densely populated within this sub-region. Lowest population density is found in Oceania-S. Pacific at only just over 3 persons per square kilometer.
As measured by Gross National Product, the North Asian region leads substantially, reflecting the dominance of Japan. This is reflected in the GNP per capita of $US 25,840 for 1990 and $US 34,630 for 1994 for Japan, well above the Region averages. Regional GNP per capita was $US 1,195 in 1990 for the Continental SE Asia region, $US 826 for Insular Asia, and only $US 347 for South Asia. Incomplete data prevents a determination of average sub-region per capita income for Oceania-S. Pacific, although Australia and New Zealand are developed countries with per capita incomes well above the sub-region average. With the exception of these two countries, Oceania-S. Pacific would be expected to have an average below $US 2,000.
Incomplete data prevents complete analysis of the rates of economic growth in the Asia Pacific Region. Incomplete information does indicate that growth rates vary widely. The Continental sub-region leads with an average growth in per-capita incomes at 5.6 percent although data is not reported for Cambodia and Myanmar. South Asia growth was 3.2 percent for 1981-90, while Insular SE Asia per capita incomes grew by 2.6 percent. Oceania-S. Pacific growth for reported countries ranged from 2-3 percent with the exception of the Solomon Islands (6.7 percent) and Papua New Guinea (-0.7 percent).

Land and forests
Basic information about the forests of the Asia Pacific Region as compiled from the FAO Forest Resources Assessment reports (1990) is summarized by sub-region in Table 3 and Appendix 3 by country.^2 As shown, the Asia Pacific Region included a total of 820 million ha. of forest and wooded lands, or approximately 16 percent of the global total. North Asia had the largest total, at just over 214 million ha., followed by Oceania-S. Pacific at almost 201 million ha. In North Asia, the region is dominated by the forest and wooded area of China, at 162 million ha. In Oceania-S. Pacific, Australia accounts for the greatest share, at almost 146 million ha. South Asia contains the smallest total of forest and wooded land, at just over 100 million ha., with India the leading country at 82.6 million ha. For the Continental SE Asia sub-region, Myanmar with almost 50 million ha. is the leading country. For Insular Asia, with 181 million ha. of forest and wooded lands, Indonesia is the
leading country with 145 million ha. As shown in Table 3, over 565 million ha. in the Asia Pacific region is considered forest. This also represents just over 16 percent of the global total. Forest lands cover an estimated 20 percent of total land area for the Asia Pacific Region as a whole, ranging from a high of 58 percent for Insular SE Asia to a low of only 10.6 percent for Oceania-S. Pacific. Asia Pacific forest cover is below the global average of 27 percent. Because of the significant differences in forest as a percent of land area, and the variance in population densities, the reported forest per capita differs significantly. For the Asia Pacific Region, forest per capita is 0.19 ha./inh., compared to the global average of 0.64. Within the Asia Pacific Region, Oceania-S. Pacific has the highest forest cover per capita, (3.33 ha./inh) in spite of the lower forest cover, due primarily to the much lower population density. South Asia, in contrast, has a per capita
forest cover of only 0.07 ha., reflecting the much higher population density together with a forest cover of only 18.9 percent.
^2 In Table 3, only countries reported as having forest lands in the FAO Resource Assessment (1990) are shown. Other countries included in the definition of the Asia Pacific Region (Table 1) participate in forest products trade or production but do not contain forest lands.
Table 3 also shows the estimated growing stock volumes and the average stocking per hectare. The Asia Pacific Region contains some 61.2 billion cubic meters of growing stock, with an average stocking of 108 cubic meters per ha. This represents just under 16 percent of global growing stock and compares closely to the share of both forest area and combined forest-wooded area. Average global forest stocking is 114 cubic meters per ha., slightly higher than that for the Asia Pacific Region. Growing stock is greatest for the Insular SE Asia sub-region, at 1-76 cubic meters per ha., reflecting the greater forest stocking in Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.

In addition to the forest lands, the Asia Pacific Region contains an estimated 255 million ha. of 'other wooded' lands, with over 112 million ha. of this being in the Oceania-S. Pacific sub-region (primarily Australia). Other countries with significant amounts of other wooded lands include India, Myanmar, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam.
Additional forest information is reported in Table 4, with a slightly different grouping of countries (See Appendix 4 for Country Statistics). This table reflects the differences between developing and developed countries. Japan has been removed from the North Asia sub-region, while Australia and New Zealand are removed from Oceania-S. Pacific. Together, these three countries are grouped as "Developed Asia" in Table 4 and Appendix 4.
In addition to basic statistics on population and total land area, Table 4 includes FAO estimates of 'exploitable' and 'non-exploitable' forest. Also included are statistics showing the degree of change over the 1981-90 period (as annual averages) for the combined forest and other wooded lands, natural forests, and plantations. Of the total forest lands of the Asia Pacific Region 480.7 million ha. are reported as 'exploitable' while some 84.5 million ha. are 'unexploitable'. The largest share of unexploitable forest is found in the Temperate-North Asia sub-region (33.8 million ha. - primarily in China), and the Developed sub-region (28.6 million ha. - mainly in Australia). India and Indonesia both also include important areas that are considered 'unexploitable'.
While the North Temperate developing countries show a net increase in forests over the 1981-90 period, at 881 thousand ha./year, all other sub-regions have shown a decline. Overall, the Asia Pacific Region had experienced a decline of almost 1.2 million ha. per year over this period. The decline in natural forests was at 4.3 million ha./year, offset in part by an increase of 2.7 million ha. in plantations. For the Temperate North Asia region, plantation development was almost entirely in China, where gains were at a rate of 1.1 million ha./year, offset by losses of natural forest at 400,000 ha./year. The other sub-regions experiencing net overall were greatest for Insular Asia and Continental SE Asia. Within the Insular sub-region, losses were largest for Indonesia, at -1.2 million ha./year, offset by a gain of 332 thousand ha./yr. of new plantations. Losses in Malaysia and the Philippines were not significantly moderated by new plantations. For the Continental region,
largest losses were in the natural forests of Myanmar and Thailand, at -401 thousand and -515 thousand ha./year respectively. Within the developed Asian countries, reported deforestation was minimal in comparison, primarily reflecting a decline of -4 thousand ha./yr. in Japan within 'other wooded' lands.
Information for the tropical countries in the Asia Pacific region as identified by ITTO is summarized in Table 5 showing the estimated status of management for production forests, as well as the degree to which those productive forests are sustainably managed. For the countries shown, the reported total of natural forests was 311.3 million ha., while the total of productive natural forests is 203, million ha. While the status of management is not reported for India, Indonesia and the Philippines, some 21 million ha. of the natural forest in the other reported countries is considered as sustainably managed with a total of 47.5 million ha. under some form of management. Plantations are estimated at 28.6 million ha. hardwoods with only 12 thousand ha. of softwoods.

Deforestation
Results of the FAO Forest Resources Assessment (1990) related to deforestation by forest type is summarized in Table 6 and data for selected countries for which this information was reported (tropical countries only) is contained in Appendix 5.^3 Total estimated deforestation was 3.9 million ha. annually, or approximately 1.3 percent annually. Deforestation was the greatest for Insular SE Asia, at 1.9 million ha./year, or a rate of 1.4 percent annually. However, the deforestation of 1.3 million ha./year in the Continental SE Asia region was actually at a higher rate, 1.7 percent per year. As widely reported, the deforestation was greatest in the tropical rainforests, where deforestation was 2.16 million ha./year, or at a rate of 1.2 percent. Although the annual amount of deforestation was considerably less for the moist deciduous forest type (656 thousand ha./yr.) this was actually at a higher rate of 1.6 percent per year. Almost 77 percent of the moist deciduous
deforestation took place in Continental SE Asia, primarily in Myanmar and Thailand. Deforestation in other forest types is more modest but important. Deforestation of 467 thousand ha./yr. in the dry deciduous forest type in concentrated in India, Thailand, and Cambodia, and represents a rate of 1.1 percent per year overall. Deforestation I the hill and montane forests was estimated at 584 thousand ha./yr., or 1.2 percent annually. Indonesia accounted for 147 thousand ha./yr., followed by Myanmar (65 thousand ha./yr.) and Pakistan (59 thousand ha./yr.). For Pakistan, this represents a rate of 4.1 percent annually, considerably higher than the sub-region or Asia Pacific as a whole.
^3 Information was reported for Tropical countries only. The temperate countries of North Asia are thus not included in this summary. Further, only Papua New Guinea was reported among the Oceania-S. Pacific sub-region.
The status of logging for the tropical countries is summarized in Table 7 and reported by country in Appendix 6. North Asia countries are not included in this summary, while Papua New Guinea is the only Oceania-S. Pacific sub-region country included. As shown, approximately 2.15 million ha. were logged annually within the countries reported, including 1.76 million ha. newly entered and 385 thousand ha. of previously logged forest. This represents an annual logging rate of just under 1 percent annually. Average annual logging density was approximately 556 cubic meters/ha. overall for the Asia Pacific Region. Total logging was highly concentrated in Insular SE Asia, where 1.72 million ha./yr. were logged, including over 1.2 million ha. in Indonesia and 455 thousand ha. in Malaysia. About 305 thousand ha./yr. were logged in Continental SE Asia, including almost 200 thousand ha./yr. in Myanmar. Rates of logging were less than 1 percent/yr. in all sub-regions excepting Insular SE
Asia, although rates were greater for individual countries, including Bangladesh (2.5 percent), Viet Nam (1.4 percent), Indonesia (1.2 percent) and Malaysia (2.6 percent). Entry into newly logged forests was lowest for South Asia, where only 11 thousand ha. were entered in contrast to 53 thousand ha./yr. of previously logged forest. In Continental Asia most new entry was in Myanmar, where approximately 178 thousand ha./yr. were entered. Over 1 million ha. of new forest was logged in Indonesia annually, while 385 thousand was entered for logging in Malaysia. A comparison of Table 6 (deforestation) and Table 7 (logging) indicates that with the exception of Insular SE Asia the area of deforestation considerably exceeds area logged on an average annual basis for 1980-90. While total estimated deforestation was 3.9 million ha./yr., total reported logging was 2.1 million ha./yr. For Insular SE Asia, deforestation was 1.9 million ha./yr. in comparison to logging of 1.7 million
ha./yr.^4 The ratio of logging to deforestation was .113 for South Asia, .232 for Continental SE Asia, .894 for Insular SE Asia, and .504 for Oceania (Papua New Guinea).
^4 It should be noted that most logging is selective, removing only a portion of standing timber. Thus reentry into a previously logged forest area removes timber left in previous logging activity. Thus forest is not necessarily cleared or 'deforested' by logging activities.

Information regarding the role of plantations in Asia Pacific as reported by Jaako Poyry (ADB, 1995) is summarized in Table 8 for 1990. Plantations totaled some 54.5 million ha., with by far the largest share (31.8 million ha.) located in China. For South Asia, the majority (13.2 million ha.) were in India, while over half of the Continental SE Asia plantations (1.5 million ha.) are in Viet Nam. Indonesia dominates plantations in Insular SE Asia, with over 6.1 million ha. Tropical Oceania has comparatively few plantations, although compared to total forest these smaller plantation holdings are significant as in the case of Fiji with 78 thousand ha. under plantations. Unfortunately, plantations for New Zealand and Australia are not reported in the ADB analysis of Asia Pacific, but these holdings are also important and growing in scope. New Zealand reported almost 1.3 million ha. of exotic plantations as of 1991.
Of the total Asia Pacific plantation resource reported in Table 8, some 42.7 million ha. are considered as non-industrial. This includes much of the plantation area in China (28.7 million ha.) and Indonesia (4.7 million ha.) as well as over half (7.6 million ha.) of the plantation area in India. A total of 5.1 million ha. of fast growing plantations were reported, including 2.1 million in China and 1.2 million ha. in Indonesia. India had some 900 thousand ha. of fast growing plantations, with Vietnam (560 thousand ha.) and Thailand (180 thousand ha.) accounting for the majority of the remaining fast growing plantation area. Other industrial plantations totaled 6.7 million ha., with the largest majority (4.8 million ha.) located in India, and another 1 million ha. in China.
The status of protected areas was also reported in the ADB review as reproduced in Table 9. Protected areas totaled 87.2 million ha. in 1990, with the largest share being located in the Temperate East Asia sub-region (North Asia). Overall, only 4.2 percent of the land area in the countries included in the ADB review were in protected status. The largest individual country protected areas were China with 30.8 million ha. followed by India with 13.2 million ha., Thailand with 6.5 million ha. and Mongolia (6.2 million ha.). By proportion of land in protected status, Bhutan was the highest at 19 percent, Thailand was second at 13 percent, and Sri Lanka third with 12 percent of land protected. Many of the reported countries fell below 1 percent of land area protected, including all countries in Tropical Oceania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, and Taiwan (China).

Forest sector industry base
The forests of Asia Pacific are important for many purposes, commercial and noncommercial. Environmental protection interests are also increasingly important as either direct objectives of forest use or as constraints on other activities. However, the use of forests for commercial activities linked to timber harvest and timber processing remain critical to the basic economies of many countries in the region. This is particularly so for the developing tropical producer countries.
Table 10 derives from the ITTO 1995 Annual Review of the global tropical forestry situation. This table extracts that information for the ITTO member producer countries of the Asia Pacific region. Some 7,637 enterprises account for over 4.82 million employees. As revealed in this table, a significant majority of employees are engaged in forest products activities in India and Indonesia, together totaling 4.5 million employees. Malaysia, with over 3,400 enterprises, accounts for an additional 205.5 thousand employees.
The allocation of employment by sub-sector is difficult, with joint reporting between sub-sectors distorting the totals. For example logging and sawmill employment is not clearly differentiated in some countries. Sawmill and veneer mill employment is not clearly separated, nor is veneer and plywood employment. Absent specific data, ITTO has estimated only total employment for India. Nevertheless, it is apparent that timber harvesting (logging), sawmilling, and the production of veneer and plywood are important components of the economies of the tropical Asia Pacific Region.
Estimated industrial capacity for sawmills, veneer mills and plywood mills are reported as based on responses from ITTO member countries. Average conversion rates are also estimated for these three sectors, indicating the relative ratio of product output (in physical product units) to use of timber (roundwood). For sawmills, conversion rates cluster near 0.50 with the exception of Papua New Guinea which is estimated at only 0.25. Veneer conversion efficiency is better as reported for Indonesia and Malaysia and at 0.50 for the Philippines. Plywood conversion is more variable, from 0.70 for Malaysia to a low of 0.40 for Papua New Guinea.

Roundwood production
Forest products depend, of course, on the availability of timber - harvested either domestically or imported from other supply sources. The total production of roundwood, utilized for all purposes including fuelwood and exports, is summarized in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 11 for 1980, 1985 and 1990-94. This summary is based on the information reported in detail by sub-region and country in Appendix 7. These tables also show the makeup of total roundwood production by major species group (conifer and non-conifer). Total Asia Pacific Region roundwood production has increased from 891.3 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 1 billion cubic meters for the period 1990-94, reaching a high of 1.13 billion cubic meters in 1994. All sub-regions within the Asia Pacific Region have experienced growth in production over this period. Production is dominantly non-conifer species, reaching 919 million cubic meters in 1994 from a level of just over 722 million cubic meters in
1980. Conifer roundwood production was 213 million cubic meters in 1994, up from 169 million cubic meters in 1980. Non-conifer roundwood production increased for all sub-regions over the 1980-94 period, and conifer production increased for all sub-regions with the exception of Insular SE Asia, where production declined from 1.2 million cubic meters in 1980 to 752 thousand cubic meters in 1994.
For South Asia, India was the dominant producer of roundwood, primarily non-conifer, with a total output of 281 million cubic meters in 1994 which included 270 million cubic meters of non-conifer roundwood. For the Continental sub-region, essentially all production was non-conifer, led by Thailand (35 million cubic meters) and Viet Nam. (34.2 million cubic meters) in 1994. Myanmar produced 21.9 million cubic meters in 1994. The North Asia sub-region accounted for the majority of conifer roundwood throughout this period, increasing from 144.2 million cubic meters in 1980 to 172.9 million cubic meters in 1994. The majority of North Asia's roundwood production was in China, with a total of 341 million cubic meters in 1994 which was approximately balanced at 146.3 million cubic meters of conifer and 157 million cubic meters of non-conifer roundwood. Japan was the second leading producer within this sub-region for both conifer and non-conifer roundwood, with total roundwood
production at 25.8 million cubic meters in 1994 which represented a decline from 34.4 million cubic meters in 1980. Japan's production is primarily conifer (18.9 million cubic meters in 1994), with 6.9 million cubic meters of non-conifer roundwood. Both conifer and non-conifer production declined from 1980 to 1994. South Korea and Mongolia also experienced declining roundwood production in contrast to the overall sub-region increased production trend.
Insular SE Asia roundwood production increased from 214.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to a high of 272.1 million cubic meters in 1992 prior to declining to 268.6 million cubic meters by 1994. Conifer production declined from 1.2 million cubic meters in 1980 to 752 million cubic meters in 1994. At the same time, non-conifer production increased from 213 million cubic meters (1980) to 271.4 million cubic meters in 1992, then declining to 267 million cubic meters for 1993-94. As is well recognized, this sub-region is led by production in Indonesia, followed by Malaysia and the Philippines. Outside of India and China, these three countries of Insular SE Asia produce the majority of the Asia-Pacific roundwood, particularly non-conifer roundwood.

Indonesian total roundwood production increased from 145.8 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 186.3 million cubic meters in 1994. Conifer roundwood production declined over this period, from over 1 million cubic meters to an estimated 539 million cubic meters. Non-conifer production increased from 144.8 million cubic meters to over 185.7 million cubic meters in 1994. Malaysia roundwood production also increased, from 33.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 43.4 million cubic meters in 1994. Conifer roundwood production increased yet remained modest, from 12 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to just over 276 thousand cubic meters in 1993 and 211 thousand cubic meters in 1994. At the same time, non-conifer production increased from 33.9 million cubic meters to 51.5 million cubic meters in 1992, thereafter declining to 43.2 million cubic meters in 1994.
Production of roundwood in the Philippines also increased but more modestly than for Malaysia, growing from 35 million cubic meters in 1980 to 38.6 million cubic meters in 1994. Conifer roundwood production practically disappeared over this period, with essentially all production being non-conifer after 1990.
Roundwood production in the Oceania-S. Pacific sub-region increased from 34.8 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 47.3 million cubic meters in 1994. Almost all of this increase was in conifer roundwood production which grew from 14.2 million cubic meters to 26.4 million cubic meters in 1994. Australia (9.5 million cubic meters, 1994) and New Zealand (16.8 million cubic meters) showed significant increases in conifer production and did Fiji on a smaller scale (114 thousand cubic meters). Australia's non-conifer roundwood production increased between 1980 and 1985, but thereafter declined moderately to 11.9 million cubic meters in 1994. Papua New Guinea was the second leading sub-region producer of non-conifer roundwood, with a moderate increase from 7 million cubic meters to an estimated 8.1 million cubic meters annually in the 1990's. The Solomon Islands, with non-conifer production of 468 thousand cubic meters in 1994 was the third leading producer within this species
group and the fourth leading producer within the sub-region overall.

Industrial roundwood
The production of roundwood in total does not in itself give a clear idea of the flow of timber for industrial purposes. The distribution of Total Roundwood between major components is summarized in Table 12 and provided by sub-region and individual country in Appendix 8. Total roundwood production was reported at 1,150 billion cubic meters for the Asia Pacific Region in 1993, with 919.6 million cubic meters of non-conifer roundwood and 208.2 million cubic meters of conifer roundwood. This represented approximately 34.5 percent of global roundwood production, 44.7 percent of non-conifer roundwood, and 18.5 percent of conifer roundwood. An additional 22 million cubic meters was reported as Charcoal production, accounting for 15.1 percent of global charcoal output.

Fuelwood
As shown in Table 12, a significant amount of total roundwood production is classified as fuelwood. For 1993, over 855.8 million cubic meters, or 74.4 percent of total Asia Pacific regional roundwood production, was fuelwood, while 295.9 million cubic meters (25.7 percent) was industrial roundwood. This represented 20.3 percent of total global roundwood.
Fuelwood production was 349 million cubic meters (92.2 percent) for the South Asia sub-region, 209.8 million cubic meters (62.2 percent) for North Asia, and 194.6 million cubic meters for Insular SE Asia (68.9 percent). Although smaller by volume, fuelwood in Continental SE Asia was 93.6 million cubic meters but fully 88.3 percent of sub-region total roundwood production. Only for Oceania-S. Pacific was fuelwood less than two-thirds of total roundwood production (8.8 million cubic meters, 19.2 percent). Fuelwood in India was 262.8 million cubic meters or 91.4 percent. Other countries of this sub-region had equally high shares of fuelwood to total roundwood, although the total volumes were less. China was estimated to have fuelwood production of some 200 million cubic meters, or 67 percent of total roundwood production. For the DPR Korea, fuelwood production of 4.2 million cubic meters was 87.6 percent of total production,. Essentially of Hong Kong's modest roundwood
production was fuelwood. Indonesia had fuelwood production of almost 149.1 million cubic meters, or 79.2 percent of all roundwood production. For the Philippines, fuelwood at 36 million cubic meters was 90.9 percent of all roundwood. Papua New Guinea produced 8.2 million cubic meters of roundwood of which 5.5 million cubic meters (67.6 percent) was fuelwood
Industrial roundwood
Trends for non-conifer industrial roundwood are shown in Figure 4 and Table 13 and reported in detail in Appendix 9. Total non-conifer industrial roundwood has fluctuated over the 1980-1994 period, from a low of 157.5 million cubic meters in 1980 to a high of 180.5 million cubic meters in 1992. Production declined in both 1993 and 1994, to a total of 169.8 million cubic meters. Production has declined from 1980 levels for Continental Asia and Oceania-S. Pacific sub-regions, increased only slightly in North Asia, South Asia production increased by approximately 28 percent between 1980 and 1992 before declining slightly in 1993-94. Insular SE Asia production grew from 68 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 87.1 million cubic meters in 1992,, thereafter falling by 10 million cubic meters to 77.3 million cubic meters in 1994. India and Pakistan accounted for most of the change within the South Asia sub-region, while Viet Nam had the greatest grain in the Continental Asia
region, partly off-setting a decline of almost 2 million cubic meters in Thailand. China increased production from 29.2 million cubic meters (1980) to almost 35.7 million cubic meters in 1994, leading the North Temperate Asia sub-region. Japan production declined by almost 50 percent to 6.8 million cubic meters. South Korea and Mongolia also showed proportionately large declines in the production of non-conifer industrial roundwood. Within Insular Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia both increased output, while the Philippines showed a sharp drop. Indonesia production grew from 29.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to 38.3 million cubic meters in 1991, remaining at this level to 1993 and dropped slightly to 37.6 million cubic meters in 1994. Malaysia increased production from 29.1 million cubic meters in 1980 to a peak of 44.8 million cubic meters in 1992, then experienced declines in 1993 and 1994 to 36.2 million cubic meters. Production in Oceania-S. Pacific was essentially constant,
declining by 1 million cubic meters between 1980 and 1994. However, declines in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand together exceeded the increase in output in Papua New Guinea from 1.6 million to 2.6 million cubic meters.

Comparable summary information for the sub-regions of the Asia Pacific Region for conifer industrial roundwood production is included in Figure 5 and Table 14, with sub-region and country detail included in Appendix 10. Total Asia Pacific Regional production increased from 93.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to 116.6 million cubic meters in 1994 with rather steady year to year increases from 1990-94. North Asia production increased by over 10 million cubic meters, from 74.2 million cubic meters to 84.6 million cubic meters. Gains of almost 14 million cubic meters in China were offset by a decline of 2.7 million decline in Japan and almost 750 thousand cubic meters in Mongolia. Oceania-S. Pacific production also increased sharply, from 13.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 25.8 million cubic meters in 1994. Australia more than doubled output from 4 million to 8.9 million cubic meters, while New Zealand production grew from 9.7 million to over 16.7 million cubic meters.
Other regional production changes were modest, with Papua New Guinea output falling by almost half to 64 thousand cubic meters and Fiji production tripling from 34 to 114 thousand cubic meters.
In South Asia, India's production remained essentially stable, growing slightly from 1980 to 1985, thereafter remaining near 2.8 million cubic meters. Pakistan's modest production grew from 120 to 438 thousand cubic meters in 1992 and declined to only 327 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Continental Asia production remained near 2.3 million cubic meters over the 1980-1994 period, with Laos production growing to 216 thousand cubic meters while production in Viet Nam declined from 456 thousand cubic meters in 1985 to an estimated 173 thousand cubic meters for 1994. For Insular SE Asia, production in Indonesia declined from a reported 1 million cubic meters in 1980 to approximately 539 thousand during the balance of the covered period. Malaysia production increased to 300 thousand cubic meters in 1990, but has declined to only 211 thousand cubic meters for 1994.

It is the industrial roundwood component of total timber production that forms the basis for both domestic production of primary products and for international trade. Based on perceived comparative advantage, stage of economic development, and related industrial and trade strategies, countries of the Asia Pacific Region can choose to process the available industrial timber supply in domestically located facilities and to then consume/trade those basic products, or alternatively, supply unprocessed timber to the international marketplace.
Trade in roundwood
Summary information regarding trade in total roundwood by Asia Pacific sub-region is reported in Figure 6 and Table 15 by Volume and Figure 7 and Table 16 by Value for the period 1980, 1985 and 1990-94. Detailed statistics by country and sub-region are contained in Appendix 11.
As indicated in Table 15, the Asia-Pacific region as a whole is a net importer of roundwood. Total imports have varied between a low of 62.8 million cubic meters in 1985 to a high of 72.2 million cubic meters in 1991. Imports declined from 1991-1994 to a level of 65.5 million cubic meters in 1994. Total Roundwood exports also declined over this period, from over 44 million cubic meters in 1980 to 30.4 million cubic meters in 1993, with an increase to 32.7 million cubic meters in 1994. On a net trade basis, the entire Asia Pacific region imported some 32.8 million cubic meters in 1994 than was exported, This trade deficit on a volume basis has existed throughout the 1980-94 period, from a low of 26.6 million cubic meters in 1980 to a high of 34.1 million cubic meters in 1991.^5 Examination of Table 15 reveals that North Asia was a net importer, with a deficit in volume trade in roundwood throughout the observed period. This region had a negative trade volume balance of 68.7
million cubic meters in 1980 which varied in the early 1990's reaching a negative balance of 59.5 million cubic meters in 1994. The greatest source of this deficit in roundwood was Japan with net imports of over 45.8 million cubic meters in 1994. South Korea and China were the other major sources of the sub-region's roundwood trade volume deficit. The South Asia region was also a net importer, having had a trade volume surplus of 255 thousand cubic meters in 1980 which reached a maximum deficit of 1.4 million cubic meters in 1990 before declining to a negative volume balance of only 367 thousand cubic meters for 1994. India reached a negative volume balance of almost 1.3 million cubic meters in 1990 before reducing import volumes significantly to only 285 thousand cubic meters in 1994. Pakistan also had an increasing volume deficit through the period, reaching almost 117 thousand cubic meters in 1994.
^5 The net trade for each sub-region implicitly cancels out trade between countries in that region, leaving a net trade balance for the sub-region. Summing the positions of each sub-region in turn nets out trade between sub-regions, deriving a total net trade balance for the entire Asia Pacific region.

Sri Lanka was a small net exporter during most of the period, yet had a negative balance in 1994. Oceania-S. Pacific had the largest positive net volume balance in total roundwood, reaching 16.9 million cubic meters for 1994. This positive balance had increased from 9.1 million cubic meters in 1980. With the exception of modest imports by Australia (14 thousand cubic meters in 1994), this sub-region is primarily a roundwood exporter region. Australian exports ranged from a low of 5.9 million cubic meters in 1990 to a high of 7.3 million cubic meters in 1994. New Zealand was the second largest exporter, with exports growing steadily in the 1990's to reach 5.5 million cubic meters in 1994. Papua New Guinea was the third major exporter of the sub-region, with exports growing from only 773 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to almost 3.2 million cubic meters by 1994. More moderate by volume, exports from Fiji and the Solomon Islands increased at a rapid rate, reaching 251 thousand
and 593 thousand cubic meters respectively in 1994.
Perhaps the most significant trend illustrated in Table 15 is the rapidly declining positive volume trade balance in roundwood from Insular SE Asia. Imports dipped after 1980, but exports have fallen sharply, from almost 34 million cubic meters in 1980 to only 11.1 million cubic meters in 1994. This is, of course, directly related to the decision to ban log exports from Indonesia after 1980 with a subsequent decline from exports of 16.6 million cubic meters (1980) to about 1.6 million cubic meters in the 1991-94 period. At the same time, exports of roundwood from Malaysia increased from 15.8 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 20. 3 million cubic meters by 1985. Thereafter, exports held at 18 to 19.5 million cubic meters through 1992, then declined to 8.8 million cubic meters for 1994. The Philippines has continued to be a modest net importer of roundwood, while Singapore, on the other hand, has experienced a variable trend, beginning as a net importer of over 1.2 million
cubic meters in 1980 but becoming a net volume exporter from 1990-1994. Continental SE Asia has, with the exception of 1990 experienced a net trade volume surplus in roundwood, having a positive balance of 519 thousand cubic meters in 1993, slipping to 311 thousand cubic meters in 1994. While the majority of imports have been by Thailand (1.5 million cubic meters in 1994), the major sub-region exporter has been Myanmar. Exports from Myanmar exceeded 1.4 million cubic meters in 1992, thereafter declining to 982 million cubic meters in 1994.
As shown in Table 16, the Asia Pacific region has been a net importer of roundwood in value terms. While exports have ranged from US$ 3.4 billion in 1980 to a low of US$ 1.6 billion in 1985, exports have been near US$ 3.1 billion for the period 199294. At the same time, import values have increased from a low of US$ 5.1 billion in 1985 to US$ 9.7 billion in 1993 before a decline to just over US$ 9 billion for 1994. Oceania-S. Pacific has seen a growth in net roundwood value trade, reaching US$ 1.6 billion for 1994. North Asia, led by Japan of over US$ 7.3 billion in 1993, has consistently had a deficit balance of over US$ 7 billion in the 1990's with a high of US$ 9.2 billion in 1993. Insular Asia, although maintaining a positive balance by value, has seen a major decline from US$ 2.18 billion in 1980 to US$ 965 million for 1994. This trend, of course, reflects the log volume trends for Indonesia and Malaysia noted above.

Industrial roundwood trade
Most trade in roundwood would be for industrial product conversion elsewhere. Relatively little non-Industrial roundwood would enter international trade. Industrial roundwood historically was defined to include saw- and veneer logs, pulpwood, and 'other industrial'. However, with the establishment of the international harmonized trade classification system, the sub-categories were largely displaced with new separate categories for industrial roundwood for conifer, non-conifer-tropical, and non-conifer-other. As of 1989, the FAO database for forestry and forest products stopped reporting trade for the prior saw- and veneer log and other sub-categories, hence limiting the availability of time series date which is more recent.
Data compiled from the current FAOSTAT for the three categories of industrial roundwood are discussed briefly here for the period 1991 - 1994. Figure 8 and Table 17 presents sub-region summaries for industrial conifer roundwood imports, exports and net trade by volume. 18 summarized imports, exports and net trade by value. Detailed sub-region and country information is presented in Appendix 12.
As shown in Table 17, net Asia Pacific Conifer Roundwood imports varied from a high of 24.8 million cubic meters in 1991 to a low of 22.3 million cubic meters for 1993, increasing just slightly to 23.5 million cubic meters for 1994. Conifer industrial roundwood exports were considerably less, reaching just under 6 million cubic meters for 1994, up from 4.4 million cubic meters for 1991. For the Asia Pacific region as a whole, the region was a net importer of industrial conifer roundwood, with net imports of 17.5 million cubic meters for 1994. This was a decline from 20.4 million cubic meters for 1991.
Imports of industrial conifer roundwood was centered in North Asia, where Japan was the largest importer with 14.4 million cubic meters imported in 1994, almost 1 million cubic meters below the 15.3 million cubic meters imported in 1991. South Korea was the second leading importer, with 7.3 million cubic meters imported in 1994, up from the 6.4 million cubic meters imported in 1991. China was the third leading country in the North Asia sub-region in terms of industrial conifer roundwood imports, with the volume declining from 2.8 million cubic meters for 1991 to just under 1.6 million cubic meters in 1994. Oceania-S. Pacific was the leading exporter sub-region for industrial conifer roundwood, led by New Zealand with exports of over 4.8 million cubic meters in 1994. This represented an increase of 1.2 million cubic meters in New Zealand exports over 1991. Australia saw exports increase to 415 thousand cubic meters in 1994, up from only 135 thousand cubic meters for 1991.
Myanmar (Continental sub-region) increased exports to 268 thousand cubic meters in 1994, being the largest sub-region exporter, followed by Laos with exports of 56 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Insular SE Asia was not a significant sub-region in terms of industrial conifer roundwood trade, with the Philippines being the largest importer (28 thousand cubic meters in 1994) and Malaysia the largest exporter. For Malaysia, exports declined from 185 thousand cubic meters in 1991 to only 71 thousand cubic meters in 1994.

Reflecting the volume of industrial conifer roundwood trade, Figure 9 and Table 18 confirm that Asia Pacific is a significant net importer in value terms as well, with the regional deficit almost US$ 3.3 billion for 1993. As with volume, the largest net deficit region has been North Asia, with Japan, South Korea, and China accounting for almost all imports. Hong Kong experienced a net deficit with declining imports, reflecting in part the slow-down of conifer industrial roundwood imports into the People's Republic of China.
Trade in Non-Conifer Tropical Industrial Roundwood is summarized by sub-region in Figure 10 and Table 19. Perhaps surprisingly, Asia Pacific Region is nearing a balance in overall trade in non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood. Imports were 13.9 million cubic meters for 1994, down from 20.6 million cubic meters in 1991. At the same time, exports declined from 22.8 million cubic meters to only 13.4 million cubic meters. As a consequence, net volume trade declined from almost 3.1 million cubic meters (net exports) for 1992 to -486 thousand cubic meters (net imports) for 1994. North Asia had the greatest negative trade balance by volume, but which had declined from 19.5 million cubic meters (1991) to 8.7 million cubic meters for 1994. While Japan imports dropped modestly, to 7.4 million cubic meters in 1994, imports by China fell from 4.1 million cubic meters in 1991 to just under 1.5 million cubic meters for 1994. At the same time, imports by South Korea declined, from 4.1
million cubic meters to just 2.1 million cubic meters in 1994. Imports to the Continental SE Asia region were predominantly for Thailand, while exports were from Myanmar and Cambodia. Myanmar exports dropped from 1.2 million cubic meters in 1991 to 602 thousand cubic meters in 1994. Cambodia exports reached 499 thousand cubic meters in 1992 before declining to only 301 thousand cubic meters for 1994.
Insular SE Asia dominated exports of non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood within Asia Pacific,, yet saw the total export decline from 19.5 million cubic meters in 1991 to only 8.7 million cubic meters for 1994. While the Philippines and Singapore were small net importers, Malaysia saw exports decline from 19. 19.3 million cubic meters to 8.6 million cubic meters in 1994. Indonesia, with a ban on the export of unprocessed timber, saw volumes continue to decline, from only 134 thousand cubic meters in 1991 to just 43 thousand cubic meters for 1994.
Papua New Guinea was the major exporter of non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood within the Oceania-S. Pacific sub-region, with volume of exports increasing from 1.3 million cubic meters to 3.1 million cubic meters between 1991-1994. The Solomon Islands increased its modest exports from 295 thousand to 592 thousand cubic meters.

The trends in Non-Conifer Tropical Industrial Roundwood trade by volume reflected as well in value terms as summarized in Figure 11 and Table 20. For 1991 and 1994 the Asia Pacific Region had a negative trade balance of over US$ 1 billion, with a sharp drop in 1992 but a corresponding peak in 1993. North Asia had a significant deficit (US$ 2.6 billion, 1994) while both Insular Asia and Oceania S.-Pacific had positive balances. As reported in Appendix 13, Japan had the largest deficit by value, at US$ 1.8 billion in 1994, but South Korea ($US 371 million), China (US$ 250 million) and Hong Kong (US$ 97.4 million) also contributed to the over-all imbalance in this sub-region's trade in non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood.
South Asia was most directly influenced by small and declining net imports by value by India, where imports dropped from US$ 158.6 million to just under US$ 46 million for 1994. Pakistan saw net imports increase from US$ 3.6 million to almost US$ 6.2 million during this time. Thailand, Myanmar and Viet Nam all saw exports drop (by value) from 1991-94, with Cambodia and Laos experiencing gains. Thailand had slightly declining imports by value, yet had imports averaging about US$ 260 million for 1991-94 while exports dropped to near zero.
Insular SE Asia's net export balance for non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood trade shrank from US$ 1.5 billion in 1991 to just under US$ 997 million by 1994. While imports increased for Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, exports declined more significantly with the exception of Singapore. Malaysia exported declined from almost US$ 1.5 billion to US$ 974.6 million from 1991-94. By comparison, trade in Non-Conifer (Other) Industrial Roundwood was minor relative to both Conifer and Non-Conifer Tropical Industrial Roundwood. Summaries of Non-Conifer (Other) imports, exports and net trade by volume and value are provided in Figure 12, Table 21 and Figure 13 and Table 22, with sub-region and country details contained in Appendix 14.
The Asia Pacific Region was a net importer of Non-Conifer (Other) industrial roundwood over the 1991-94 period by both volume and value. North Asia was the largest importer, and had the greatest sub-region deficit. The volume of imports by the North Region declined moderately, from 1.8 million cubic meters in 1991 to 1.4 million cubic meters for 1994. Exports remained at about 450-500 thousand cubic meters over the period. The net trade position of North Asia for this category improved slightly, from a deficit of 1.2 million cubic meters in 1991 to 937 thousand cubic meters by 1994. China was the largest importer within the sub-region, with an import volume of 704 thousand cubic meters in 1994; however, China was also the largest sub-region exporter, exporting 418 thousand cubic meters in 1994, down moderately from earlier years. In contrast, Japan, and to a lesser extent, South Korea were largely importers. For Japan, imports dropped from 1.1 million cubic meters in 1991 to
546 million cubic meters for 1994.
Insular SE Asia also had a deficit in trade in Non-Conifer (Other) Industrial Roundwood trade, with a net deficit of about 320 thousand cubic meters for 1993-94.

In contrast, Oceania-S. Pacific was the only sub-region with a net surplus in trade of Non-Conifer (Other) Industrial Roundwood. Volume of exports increased from 57 thousand cubic meters (1991) to 207 thousand cubic meters for 1994, while imports were insignificant. Within the sub-region, most exports were by New Zealand.
Sawnwood production and trade
Historically, the largest share of roundwood not exported by countries in the Asia Pacific Region has gone for the domestic production of sawnwood. Sawnwood produced domestically, of course, may subsequently be exported as Sawnwood rather than as roundwood. Further, Imported logs may also be used to produce sawnwood. The production, import, export, and net trade by volume for Non-Conifer Sawnwood is summarized in Figure 14, Figure 15, and Table 23. Imports, exports and net trade by value is summarized in Table 24. Detailed statistics for Non-Conifer Sawnwood by sub-region and country are reported in Appendix 15.
Non-Conifer Sawnwood production has increased overall from the Asia Pacific Region, from 44.6 million cubic meters in 1980 to 51 million cubic meters in 1994. Production was just under 53 million cubic meters for 1990, thereafter declining moderately. Major production was shared by Insular SE Asia (17.3 million cubic meters), South Asia (16.3 million cubic meters) and North Asia (13.6 million cubic meters) with smaller production in Continental Asia (2 million cubic meters) and Oceania-S. Pacific (1.8 million cubic meters). Production has declined for North Asia, while South Asia and Insular SE Asia have both experienced increasing production. India dominates production in South Asia, Thailand (with declining production) and Viet Nam lead Continental Asia in production, and China dominates production in North Asia, followed by Japan. China's production has increased from 7.8 million cubic meters to almost 9.7 million cubic meters from 1980-94, while Japan's production has
declined from 7.0 to 2.9 million cubic meters.
Insular SE Asia production of non-conifer Sawnwood is largely shared between Malaysia (8.8 million cubic meters, 1994) and Indonesia (8.0 million cubic meters). Indonesia's production reached a high of 9 million cubic meters in 1990 and is estimated to have declined annually thereafter. Malaysia reached a production of 9.3 million cubic meters in 1992-93, up from 5.4 million cubic meters in 1985. Oceania production is highly concentrated in Australia, with volume declining from 2.1 million cubic meters in 1980 to 1.5-1.6 million cubic meters from 1991-94.
Non-conifer Sawnwood imports are lead by North Asia and more recently by Continental Asia. North Asia imports increased from 905 thousand cubic meters to a high of 4.8 million cubic meters in 1993. Continental Asia imports grew from 345 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to 2.3 million cubic meters for 1994. North Asia importers are primarily Japan and China, both of which have increased significantly since 1980, and South Korea, where imports have grown from zero to 934 thousand cubic meters.

Continental Asia imports have been essentially to Thailand, reaching 2.3 million cubic meters in 1994 from only 342 thousand cubic meters in 1980. Insular Asia imports have bee to Singapore, although 1994 volume declined from near 1 million cubic meters (1990-93) to 610 thousand cubic meters in 1994. Philippine imports, starting in 1992 grew to 438 thousand cubic meters, well below the long term decline in production. In spite of leading production in Oceania, Australia is also the dominant importer of non-conifer sawnwood.
Exports of non-conifer sawnwood historically exceeded imports from 1980 through 1993, but with the net trade balance declining. While the region had a net trade surplus in non-conifer sawnwood of 3.8 million cubic meters in 1980, this had dropped to under 1 million cubic meters in 1991, to only 354 thousand cubic meters in 1993, with a net volume trade deficit of 1.5 million cubic meters for 1994. This was primarily in response to a decline in exports after 1992, particularly declines for Insular SE Asia and Continental Asia. Insular SE Asia was the only sub-region with a positive volume trade balance in non-conifer sawnwood, reaching a peak of 6 million cubic meters in 1992 before declining to 4.4 million cubic meters in 1994. North Asia had a deficit in trade of 4.1 million cubic meters in 1994, almost offsetting the positive volume balance for Insular SE Asia. While exports have varied and declined from 1992 peaks, the switch from an Asia Pacific surplus to a deficit
position was largely brought about by the increase in imports.
Continental Asia's position has largely reflected the dynamics in production (decline), imports (increased) and exports (small) for non-conifer sawnwood. In contrast, North Asia's changing trade position is reflective of the decline in Japan's production and increase in imports, together with China's modest increase in production but significant increase in imports. South Korea's declining production has also been matched with more modest increases in imports.
Insular Asia's position has reflected moderate increased production overall, stable imports, moderately declining exports, and a slightly declining trade balance in the volume of non-conifer sawnwood. Within the sub-region, Indonesia and Malaysia have increased production while Singapore (largely using imported logs) has reduced non-conifer sawnwood production, declining production in the Philippines, decreased imports by Singapore with increased Philippine imports, and declining Indonesia exports.
As shown in Figure 16 and Table 24, the net trade position for the Asia Pacific Region as a whole has changed from a net surplus of US$ 871 million in 19780 to a deficit of US$ 649 million in 1994. Only the gain in exports by Insular SE Asia in 1992 enabled Asia Pacific to hold a modest positive balance in that year. Larger imports by North Asia subsequently turned this small surplus to the deficits shown for 1993-94. Indonesia and Malaysia were the only Insular Asia countries to have a positive balance by value for non-conifer sawnwood in 1994, led by Malaysia's surplus of over US$ 1.5 billion.

The Asia Pacific Region is also a major producer of Conifer Sawnwood, as indicated in Figure 17, Figure 18, and Table 25. Total regional production was 50.5 million cubic meters in 1980, increasing to 51. 9 million cubic meters in 1990. Production was 49.5 million cubic meters in 1994. As compared with Non-Conifer Sawnwood (Table 23), production volumes within Asia Pacific Region are approximately comparable, particularly in the 1990's. However, patterns of production are quite different
Conifer Sawnwood production is largely concentrated in North Asia, primarily Japan and China. Japan's production has declined, from 29.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to 22.8 million cubic meters in 1994, reflecting changed patterns of conifer industrial roundwood imports. China's production of conifer sawnwood was 15.5 million cubic meters in 1994, about equal to 1990 production but below the high of 17.7 million cubic meters of 1985. South Korea production reached 3.2 million cubic meters in 1991, then declined to approximately 2.7 million cubic meters for 1993-94 (see Appendix 16 for country and sub-region details).
Oceania-S. Pacific was the second leading sub-region of conifer sawnwood production, concentrated primarily in New Zealand. (2.8 million cubic meters, 1994) and Australia (1.9 million cubic meters, 1994). Both New Zealand and Australia have increased production of conifer sawnwood since 1980 in response to increased harvest of plantation timber. Elsewhere, conifer sawnwood production has remained modest. India has maintained production estimated at 2.5 million cubic meters over the past decade, while Pakistan has had only small increased production, reaching 577 thousand cubic meters in 1993 before declining to 432 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Production in Continental Asia has been stagnant with the largest share originating in Viet Nam. Cambodia and Myanmar have only had estimated conifer sawnwood production since 1992. Indonesia has experienced some increase in conifer sawnwood production, with output estimated at about 138 thousand cubic meters in the 1990's, based on
increased plantations. Fiji production reached an estimated 90 thousand cubic meters in 1991 but subsequently has declined to 57 thousand cubic meters for 1993-94.
While leading the Asia Pacific region in conifer sawnwood production, North Asia is also the dominant importer, primarily Japan. Japan's imports grew from just under 5 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 9 million cubic meters for 1994. In addition, much of Japan's production of conifer sawnwood was based on imported conifer industrial roundwood. China's imports of conifer sawnwood have also grown, from virtually nothing in 1980 to 850 thousand cubic meters for 1994. South Korea also experienced rising imports after 1990, reaching 252 thousand cubic meters for 1993 and 218 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Oceania trade in conifer sawnwood is marked by exports from New Zealand and imports by Australia. New Zealand's exports grew to over 1 million cubic meters in 1994, reflecting growth in production as plantations mature. Australia accounts for the majority of the Asia Pacific imports of conifer sawnwood outside North Asia. North Asia exports are primarily from China, with
volume above 300 thousand cubic meters for the period 1992-94. Modest exports from Insular SE Asia are primarily from Malaysia, with smaller volumes from the Philippines and Indonesia. Continental Asia exports of conifer sawnwood have been small, with the exception of 188 thousand cubic meters from Viet Nam in 1990, with 506 thousand cubic meters in 1991.

The net trade position for conifer sawnwood for Asia Pacific is also summarized in Table 25. Overall, the region has experienced an increase in the overall conifer sawnwood deficit, growing from 4.7 million cubic meters in 1980 and 1985 to over 9.7 million cubic meters by 1994. This is in addition to regional conifer sawnwood production sustained by processing of imported conifer roundwood during this period. As implied above, however, this situation is primarily a North Asia situation, represented by the shift from imported roundwood to a greater share of imported conifer sawnwood by Japan. China's more modest increase in importation of conifer sawnwood also contributed to the growing trade deficit for the North Asia sub-region. South Korea and Hong Kong also represent net importers within the North Asia sub-region.
Trade in conifer sawnwood by value is summarized in Figure 19 and Table 26 with detailed accounts included in Appendix 16. As would be expected from the discussion of volume of imports and exports above, the Asia Pacific region has a negative trade balance for conifer sawnwood which has brown from US$ 995.2 million in 1980 to over US$ 3.5 billion in 1994. As with trade volume, this situation is primarily reflective of the situation in North Asia (Japan, China and South Korea). North Asia accounted for US$ 945.7 million of the 1985 region deficit, and fully US$ 3.5 billion of the 1994 regional deficit. Surprisingly, only Insular SE Asia had a positive balance by value, with a modest surplus of US$ 52 million in 1994, with surplus trade by Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Only Singapore and Brunei had deficits for conifer sawnwood within the sub-region.
In spite of New Zealand's surplus of trade in conifer sawnwood, the large net imports by Australia and many of the South Pacific Islands contributed to an overall sub-region deficit in conifer sawnwood. This was US$ 60.9 million for 1994, down from a high of over US$ 174.5 million for 1990.

Wood-based panels
Since 1980, the production of wood-based panels has grown substantially in the Asia Pacific Region. In 1980, total production was 19.5 million cubic meters, growing to 22.3 million and 29.1 million cubic meters by 1985 and 1990 respectively. Thereafter, wood based panel production grew even more rapidly, reaching 50.7 million cubic meters by 1994. A summary of production, imports, exports and net trade in wood-based panels is shown in Figure 20, Figure 21, and Table 27, with detailed statistics by sub-region and country included in Appendix 17.
The majority of wood-based panel production is in North Asia, led by China. Sub-region production has increased from 14.2 million cubic meters in 1980 and 1990, to over 30.8 million cubic meters for 1994. China's production increased from only 2.3 million cubic meters in 1980, to almost 21.6 million cubic meters for 1994. Japan's production declined after 1980, from 10.3 million cubic meters in that year to 7.5 million cubic meters in 1994, in part the results of the drastically reduced availability of roundwood non-conifer tropical logs for panel production.
Production of wood based panels for Insular SE Asia also increased dramatically, from only 3.5 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 16 million cubic meters in 1994. This growth was largely the result of the substitution of domestic panel production for the export of unprocessed non-conifer tropical industrial log exports in Indonesia after 1980. Indonesia's wood panel production grew from 1 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 10.5 million cubic meters for 1994, a ten-fold increase. During the time, production of wood based panels in Malaysia increased from 1.1 million cubic meters to 5.1 million cubic meters in 1993, and 4.9 million cubic meters for 1994. Singapore production declined in the region, as did the Philippines. Both countries saw approximately a fifty percent decline in production from 1980-1994 near 350 thousand cubic meters for 1993-94.
Oceania also experienced an increase in wood based panel production, from 1.2 million cubic meters in 1980 to almost 2.2 million cubic meters in 1994. For 1994, both Australia and New Zealand produced approximately 1.1 million cubic meters. Growth in production in Australia has been more modest, however, up from 847 thousand cubic meters in 1980. During this time, New Zealand production grew from 319 thousand cubic meters. Production in the Continental SE Asia sub-region grew to almost 1 million cubic meters, primarily through growing output in Thailand which accounted for 929 thousand cubic meters of the 1994 sub-region total. Production of wood based panels in South Asia has remained more static, ranging between 536 thousand and 568 thousand cubic meters from 1985-94, with the majority of production (estimated at 442 thousand cubic meters) produced in India. Production in Pakistan doubled, from 48 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to some 94 million cubic meters in 1994.

The Asia Pacific region had imports of wood based panels of 13.8 million cubic meters in 1994, significantly up from the 1.2 million cubic meters imported in 1980. Most of this increase took place in North Asia, where the increased unavailability of non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood resulted in a decline in production based on imported logs and a corresponding import of wood based panels. Imports by Japan, increased from 315 thousand to over 5.6 million cubic meters; imports by South Korea grew from 17 thousand cubic meters in 1985 to over 1.7 million cubic meters, and imports by China increased from 50 thousand cubic meters (1980) to almost 4.0 million cubic meters. Hong Kong also saw imports increase but more moderately, from 273 thousand cubic meters to 1.3 million cubic meters in 1994. Insular Asia imports of wood based panels more than doubled, from 404 thousand cubic meters to over 837 thousand cubic meters. This trade was primarily by Singapore, but smaller
imports were recorded by Malaysia and the Philippines. Continental Asia saw modest imports by Thailand, while South Asia experiences small imports by Sri Lanka.
Wood panel exports also experienced strong growth over the 1980-94 period, but not as rapidly as imports. Export volume was 4.1 million cubic meters for 1980, growing to 12.4 million cubic meters by 1990. Thereafter, growth has been steady but moderate, with exports reaching 14.6 million cubic meters in 1994. As is well recognized, the greatest proportion of wood-base panel exports are from Insular SE Asia, led by Indonesia which increased exports from only 245 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to in excess of 9.2 million cubic meters in 1993 and 8.6 million cubic meters for 1994. Malaysia also experienced increased wood panel exports, from 604 thousand cubic meters in 1980 to over 3.8 million cubic meters for 1994. The Philippines saw exports drop from 435 thousand cubic meters to 58 thousand cubic meters during this period, while Singapore exports declined from a high of 860 thousand cubic meters in 1990 to just 188 thousand cubic meters for 1993 before exports recovered to
348 thousand cubic meters for 1994.
South Asia exports originated in India, with a drop in the modest exports from Bhutan after 1991. Continental Asia exports increased but were modest, with Thailand being the primary source. Thailand's exports were 194 thousand cubic meters for 1993 and declined to 157 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Sub-region exports were 207 thousand cubic meters for 1994.
The above patterns in production and trade resulted in the Asia Pacific Region as a whole being a net volume exporter, although North Asia was a strong net importer. Since 1990, Insular SE Asia has had a net trade surplus which has exceeded North Asia's net volume deficit by a diminishing margin, with 1994 balances almost offsetting. Insular SE Asia enjoyed a positive balance by volume for wood-based panels of just over 12 million cubic meters, while North Asia had a volume deficit of just under 12 million cubic meters. Oceania-S. Pacific had a small but growing positive volume trade balance, reaching 558 thousand cubic meters for 1994. As shown in Figure 22 and Table 28, wood based panel trade by value mirrors closely the volume trade flow. Insular and North Asia have converged with a positive by diminishing balance in favor of Insular SE Asia overall. Insular SE Asia had a positive balance by value of almost US$ 5.6 billion in 1993 and US$ 5.3 billion in 1994, accruing
largely to Indonesia (US$ 3.7 billion, 1994) and Malaysia (US$ 1.6 billion, 1994). Oceania has also gained a growing surplus in wood based panel trade by value, overcoming a deficit in 1980 and 1985 moving towards achieving a positive balance of US$ 188.3 thousand for 1994. This net balance accrued primarily to New Zealand and Fiji.

Wood-based pulp
The domestic consumption of wood in the Asia Pacific also includes wood fiber utilized in the manufacture of pulp. Together with the use of other non-wood based fibers, this sector provides raw material for the subsequent production of a broad range of paper and paperboard products.
Wood based pulp production in the Asia Pacific region has increased by approximately one third from 1980 to 1994, from 14.4 million metric tons to just over 20.1 million metric tons. The summary of wood pulp production, import, export and net trade by volume is given in Figure 23, Figure 24 and Table 29, and by value for trade in wood pulp in Figure 25 and Table 30. Details by sub-region and country are provided in Appendix 18.
As shown in Table 29, production of wood pulp in North Asia has dominated Asia Pacific region production, although the proportional share from this sub-region has declined. In 1980, North Asia produced over 11.3 million metric tons, or about 79 percent of total Asia Pacific production. North Asia production had increased to 14.2 million metric tons in 1991, then declined to 13.9 million metric tons for 1994, accounting for 69 percent of the regional total. The majority of sub-regional production has been in Japan, which produced an estimated 10.6 million metric tons in 1994, about the average for the 1990's but only slightly above the levels achieved in 1980 and 1985. Growth in the North sub-region production was primarily in China, where production increased by approximately 1 million metric tons between 1985 and 1994, in spite of the severe shortage of wood fiber and the high degree of utilization of non-wood fibers for pulping. South Korea also increased production within
the North Asia sub-region, from 167 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 532 thousand metric tons in 1994. Oceania-S. Pacific and South Asia sub-regions were the second and third leading wood pulp producers within the Asia Pacific region, with Oceania producing 2.4 million metric tons and South Asia 2.3 million metric tons in 1994. While the growth in production was small for Oceania, South Asia production effectively doubled from 1980 to 1994. Within Oceania the majority of wood pulp production is in New Zealand (1.4 million MT in 1994) while the balance is produced in Australia (987 thousand MT for 1994). Within South Asia, India is the dominant producer of wood based pulp, with growth from 840 thousand metric tons in 1980 to almost 2.0 million metric tons in 1994. The greatest growth for Indian production took place from 1980 to 1990, with production relatively static during the 1990's.

Wood based pulp production has also grown in Insular SE Asia, centered on Indonesia, where production grew from only 190 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 1.5 million metric tons in 1994. Indonesia accounted for almost 1.3 million metric tons, or about 83 percent of the sub-region's output in 1994. The Philippines has maintained production near 150 thousand metric tons annually since 1985, while Malaysia has only reported production for 1993-94, yielding 103 thousand metric tons in 1994. Continental SE Asia has not been a major producer of wood based pulp, yet volume increased from 10 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 123 thousand metric tons in 1994, produced in Thailand and Viet Nam.
Trade in wood-based pulp has been primarily as imports, with the Asia Pacific region as a whole having a growing deficit in trade by volume. In 1994, Asia Pacific had net imports of over 8.1 million metric tons, an increase of over 2.5 times the net imports of 3.1 million metric tons of 1980. Imports were primarily to the North Asia sub-region, in spite of this sub-region being the major Asia Pacific producer. Japan was the largest importer, followed by South Korea and China. Japan imports have grown moderately, to 3.7 million metric tons in 1994, up from 2.2 million metric tons in 1980 and 1985. South Korean imports grew from 465 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 1.9 million metric tons in 1994, an increase of some 400 percent. Growth in China's imports almost mirror that for South Korea, having increased from 449 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 1.7 million metric tons for 1994.
Insular SE Asia has also had a significant upward trend in the import of wood-based pulps, from only 184 thousand metric tons in 1980 to over 1 million metric tons for 1994. Almost all of this growth, and the majority of imports, has been by Indonesia, with imports supplementing that country's leading role within the sub-region as the dominant pulp producer. Imports of pulp by Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore have remained modest, with only Malaysia showing a doubling of import volume (to 94 thousand metric tons) in recent years.
The moderate exports of wood-based pulps from Asia Pacific are centered in Oceania-S. Pacific, where New Zealand has maintained exports averaging about 650 thousand cubic meters over the 1990's, with an export volume of 666 thousand metric tons in 1994. Insular SE Asia exports are led by Indonesia, with an export volume of 119 thousand metric tons in 1994 or only about 14 percent of the corresponding import volume for Indonesia.
As would be expected from the trends in volume of production and trade for wood-based pulps, the Asia Pacific region has a growing value deficit as well. As shown in Table 30, this deficit reached almost US$ 4 billion for 1994, well above the deficits of US$ 1.5 billion for 1980 and 1985. As with volume, North Asia accounts for both the greatest share of imports by value as well as the largest contribution to the overall Asia Pacific regional deficit. Only Oceania-S. Pacific has a positive trade balance for wood pulps.
Paper and paperboard
Wood-based pulps, together with other pulp fibers (including recycled wood fiber) constitute the basic raw material for the production of a wide variety of paper and paperboard products, including newsprint, printing and writing papers, and sanitary papers as primary products along with paperboards for carton stocks and other industrial uses. The Asia Pacific region has more than doubled the aggregate production of these items since 1980, up from a total of 31 million metric tons to over 75.5 million metric tons by 1994 (Figure 26 and Table 31). As with wood-based pulps, production of paper and paperboard in largely centered in the North Asia sub-region, where both Japan and China are major producers (Appendix 19). While Japan has maintained production at near 28.5 million metric tons since 1990, China has experienced an increase of nearly 10 million metric tons over this period, reaching a production of 26.9 million metric tons in 1994. South Korea has also had increased
production, with a growth from 1.7 million metric tons in 1980 to over 6.4 million metric tons in 1994.
Insular SE Asia is the second leading producer sub-region for paper and paperboard, closely followed by the South Asia and Oceania-S. Pacific sub-regions. Insular SE Asia production has doubled since 1990, reaching over 4.2 million metric tons in 1994. Indonesia was the leading producer, at over 3 million metric tons, followed by Magnesia (574 thousand metric tons) and the Philippines (518 thousand metric tons). South Asia has seen an increase in production of paper and paperboard from 1.1 million metric tons to over 3.2 million metric tons from 1980 to 1994, led by India where production was 2.6 million metric tons in 1994. This was up only moderately from 1990, but almost a three-fold increase from 1980. Production in Oceania-S. Pacific was concentrated in Australia, where production has increased only moderately since 1990. Sub-region production grew from 2.1 million metric tons 1980 to 2.8 million metric tons in 1990, thereafter staying near this level and reaching 3.1
million metric tons for 1994. New Zealand production has also remained relatively flat, at about 825 thousand metric tons since 1990, reaching a high of 860 thousand metric tons in 1994.
Continental SE Asia is the smallest producer sub-region for paper and paperboard products in the Asia Pacific Region, with a modest but expanding production. This sub-region achieved an output of 1.8 million metric tons in 1994, almost double the level for 1990 and well above the 385 thousand metric tons produced in 1980. As with wood pulp, the sub-region was dominated by paper and paperboard production in Thailand which accounted for 1.7 million metric tons in 1994 or 92 percent of the sub-region total.
As shown in Figure 27, the Asia Pacific region has experienced a growing deficit by volume for paper and paperboard products, reaching 7 million metric tons for 1994. Imports have grown from 4.1 million metric tons in 1980 to almost 14 million metric tons for 1994. North Asia, Insular SE Asia and Oceania-S. Pacific sub-regions have accounted for the greatest share of rising imports.

China and Hong Kong are the leading importers in North Asia, with imports of 4 million and 3 million metric tons in 1994 respectively. Japan is an important importer, at 1.4 million metric tons for 1994 but with relatively slow growing imports since 1990. China was the fastest growing importer, from 1.4 million metric tons in 1990 to the 4 million metric tons imported in 1994.
Insular SE Asia imports have been led by Singapore and Malaysia, which have experienced nearly equal trends since 1980. Sub-region imports increased from 857 thousand metric tons in 1980 to 2.4 million metric tons in 1994. Singapore accounted for 910 million metric tons, while Malaysia imported 878 thousand metric tons in 1994, both representing an increase of over three times levels of imports in 1980. Oceania, as the third leading importing sub-region, saw imports of paper and paperboard almost double since 1980, from 764 thousand metric tons to over 1.2 million metric tons. Imports were heavily dominated by Australia, accounting for over 1 million metric tons in 1994.
Exports of paper and paperboard have averaged about half the level of imports for the Asia Pacific region 1990, totaling 6.9 million metric tons in 1994. Almost 5 million metric tons were exported from North Asia, primarily by China (1.2 million MT), Hong Kong (1.5 million MT), and South Korea (1.3 million MT). Hong Kong and South Korea exports were up significantly from 1990, while China's exports grew more modestly. Japan experienced declining exports of 977 thousand metric tons in 1994 after a high of 1.2 million metric tons exported in 1992. Insular SE Asia was the second leading sub-region in terms of exports of paper and paperboard, with sub-region exports of 1.1 million metric tons in 1994, slightly more than double the level of exports for 1990. Most of the exports were from Indonesia (696 thousand metric tons in 1994) followed by Singapore (325 thousand metric tons, 1994). Indonesia was the only net exporter by volume for paper and paperboard products within this
sub-region.
Although much smaller in volume, exports from Continental SE Asia grew by a factor of three from 1990, reaching 186 thousand metric tons in 1994 which was still well below imports. Most exports originated in Thailand, where exports expanded from 52 thousand metric tons in 1990 to 183 thousand metric tons for 1994. In spite of this trend, Thailand has remained the largest net importer of paper and paperboard within the sub-region. South Asia is not a significant exporter of paper and paperboard, with occasional exports from India determining the sub-region's total.
Trade in paper and paperboard products by value is summarized in Figure 28 and Table 32, and closely reflects the trends in trade by volume. All sub-regions of Asia Pacific are net importers by value, with a deficit of US$ 4.5 billion for 1994, up significantly from US$ 1.5 billion in 1980 and US$ 3.1 billion for 1990. North Asia, followed by Insular SE Asia and Oceania are the largest net importers by value. China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Australia are the primary net importers. Virtually all of Oceania-S. Pacific are net importers with the exception of New Zealand. South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, continue to experience growing deficits in paper and paperboard trade by value.

Asia Pacific trade account - A growing deficit
The Asia Pacific region is, naturally, viewed as a most significant forested region and active participant in forest products production and trade. The above broad summary, however, reveals that the Asia Pacific region has been and continues to be a deficit forest products region whether assessed on a physical wood volume or value basis. Table 33 provides a summary of wood production and flows for the region as a whole relative to trade with the rest of the world. As noted earlier, the broadest measure of total roundwood shows that the Asia Pacific region has been a net importer, with net imports of 26.6 million cubic meters in 1980, a high of 34.1 million cubic meters in 1991, and a deficit of nearly 32.8 million cubic meters in 1994. A modest positive trade balance for tropical non-conifer industrial timber is more than offset by a deficit in volume for other non-conifer industrial timber as shown for the period 1991-94. Likewise, net trade in conifer industrial roundwood
reveals a continuing volume deficit of almost 17.5 million cubic meters for 1992-94. Asia Pacific has maintained a positive but declining net trade balance for non-conifer sawnwood with the rest of the world,, yet has seen a growing net deficit in conifer sawnwood. While enjoying a net positive balance for non-conifer sawnwood of 1.5 million cubic meters in 1994, the region as a whole had a deficit in trade volume of conifer sawnwood of 9.7 million cubic meters.
Wood panel production has yielded a positive trade balance but one that has steadily fallen since 1985, from 4.5 million cubic meters to 712 thousand cubic meters in 1994. Wood pulp together with paper and paperboard accounts both show large and growing deficits. Wood pulp net trade was -8.1 million metric tons in 1994, with paper and paperboard in deficit by -7.1 million metric tons.
The Asia Pacific trade accounts for all forest products by value is shown in Table 34 by both sub-region and for the region as a whole. Detailed balances by country are included in Appendix 20. The combined Asia Pacific overall regional summary in Table 34 illustrates the trade relationship with the rest of the world, while the sub-regional balances illustrate the differences within the Asia Pacific Region. Overall, the Asia Pacific trade accounts with the rest of the world was in deficit by US$ 18.1 billion in 1994, an increase from US$ 5.9 billion in 1985.^6 For the sub-regions, Oceania-S. Pacific has moved from a moderate deficit in trade (US$ -329 million) in 1990 to a positive trade balance of US$ 1 billion for 1994. Insular Asia, as the dominant exporter sub-region of Asia Pacific, had a growing surplus which increased from US$ 3 billion in 1985 to almost US$ 7 billion in 1994 after a high of US$ 7.9 billion in 1993. North Asia, on the other hand, has had a long term
negative account for forest products trade, increasing from US$ 8.1 billion in 1985 to almost US$ 24.4 billion for 1994. Surging imports for North Asia have not been matched by growth in exports, either for the sub-region or from the rest of the Asia Pacific Region.
^6 Due to technical difficulties, net value trade for North Asia and Insular Asia is not included in Table 34 at this time. Thus the 1980 Asia Pacific Total should be used and interpreted with caution.

Markets and major trade flows
Timber and forest products have become increasingly mobile in the global economy, flowing from areas of primary competitive advantage for production to points of consumption either for intermediate processing or end use. In spite of this emerging globalization of trade, most forest products are dominated by a relatively few bilateral trade flows. Major consumption is highly correlated with the combination of relatively abundant resources and high national incomes and economic development.
Major trade flows from leading exporters to major importers are compiled by FAO as part of the Forest Products yearbook. Information for roundwood, sawnwood, veneer sheets, plywood, particleboard, fiberboard, wood pulp, and paper and paperboard are reproduced from the 1994 Yearbook in Appendix 21 covering trade flows for 1992 and 1993.
Trade in conifer roundwood is primarily focused on the USA, Russian Federation, New Zealand, and Canada as major exporters, accounting for 27.8 million cubic meters (65.8 percent) with Chile emerging as an exporter of plantation grown pine. Within Central and Eastern Europe, Germany (3.7 million cubic meters), followed by France, Belgium-Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, and Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway), are leading exporters (20.3 percent), trading almost entirely within the European Community. The former group (USA, Russia, New Zealand and Canada) are largely oriented towards the Pacific Rim, although the USA and Canada are involved in both Pacific Rim and European Trade for conifer roundwoods. Dominant importers outside North America are in the Asia Pacific region and include Japan, South Korea, and China which together accounted for 54 percent of imports. European importers are led by Austria, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Total global
trade estimated for 1993 was 42.3 million cubic meters.
Trade in tropical non-conifer roundwood was estimated at 16.3 million cubic meters for 1993, and was lead by exports from Malaysia (56.2 percent), Papua New Guinea (11.3 percent), the African producers of Gabon, Cameroon and the Congo (14.9 percent), and to a lesser extent Myanmar, the Solomon Islands and Cambodia. Importers include Japan (7.8 million cubic meters, 47.7 percent), South Korea, China, Thailand, Hong Kong and the Philippines (5.7 million cubic meters, 35.1 percent) within the Asia Pacific region, with France, Italy, Portugal and Spain leading European importers (1.6 million cubic meters, 10.1 percent).
Other non-conifer roundwood (primarily temperate hardwoods) is lead by exports from the Russian Federation (4.5 million cubic meters), France (1.4 million cubic meters), the USA (1.9 million cubic meters), and Argentina (0.8 million cubic meters). Total exports in 1993 were estimated at 13.6 million cubic meters. Importers include Finland, Sweden, Italy (6.3 million cubic meters, 46.4 percent) and Japan (1.4 million cubic meters, 10.6 percent). Canada, Belgium, and Australia also imported significant volumes. Japan, as the major Asia Pacific importer, received non-conifer roundwood primarily from Russia, Canada and China (95.4 percent of Japan imports). The USA largest export market was Canada, which accounted for almost 1 million cubic meters, or 49.2 percent of all USA exports.
Conifer sawnwood trade is highly concentrated in trade between Canada and the USA. Total trade of 85.3 million cubic meters in 1993 included bilateral trade of over 35 million cubic meters between these two countries or 41 percent of the global total. Sweden, the USA, Russia, Finland and Austria are major exporters. Canada alone accounted for 50.2 percent of total exports. Japan the UK, Germany and Italy are also major importers. Non-conifer timber trade in sawnwood of 16.9 million cubic meters in 1993 centered on exports from Malaysia (5.3 million cubic meters, 31.1 percent), and the USA (2.4 million cubic meters, 14.4 percent). France, Singapore, Indonesia and Canada play important secondary roles as major exporters. Imports are oriented to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, China, and Singapore in Asia Pacific (5.7 million cubic meters, 32.3 percent), and Italy in Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany are leading European importers (2.3 million cubic meters, 13.7
percent).
Trade flows for veneer sheets are relatively small by volume, reaching 2.6 million cubic meters in 1993. Major exports were from Malaysia USA, Canada and Brazil. Imports were by Japan and China in the Asia Pacific region, the USA, Germany and Italy in Europe. In contrast, plywood trade was an estimated 17.1 million cubic meters, with Indonesia alone accounting for 8.9 million cubic meters, or 52 percent of exports. Malaysia was the second leading exporter, followed by Singapore and Hong Kong among the Asian Pacific countries. North America (USA and Canada) were significant exporters. Brazil lead Latin American exporters, while Finland was the leading European exporter. Imports were primarily by Japan, China and South Korea in the Asia Pacific Region, followed by Hong Kong, China and Singapore. The USA was the third leading importer after Japan and China. The UK and Germany lead European importers, followed by the Netherlands and Belgium-Luxembourg.
Trade in Particleboard has increased to 10.7 million cubic meters for 1993, with Canada being the largest exporter (28 percent). Belgium, Germany, Austria and France lead European exporters with approximately 38 percent of all global exports. Fiberboard exports have been more modest, but reached 4.4 million cubic meters for 1993. Exporters were more diverse, led by the USA with 14 percent of the total, followed by New Zealand (8 percent) within Asia Pacific. Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and Germany within Europe (32 percent), were followed by Brazil and Canada. Imports were primarily to the USA, UK, Japan, Germany, China, Canada and the Netherlands.
Global wood pulp trade in 1993 was 29.2 million metric tons. Exports were led by Canada (32 percent) and the USA (20 percent). Sweden, Finland and Portugal led European exports, while Brazil and Chile lead Latin American exporters. New Zealand was the leading Asia Pacific exporter of the Asia Pacific region, with about 2.4 percent of global exports. Imports were primarily to the USA (17 percent), Germany (12 percent) and Japan (11 percent). Other leading importers were in Europe (Italy, France, UK, Belgium). South Korea, Indonesia, and China followed Japan as Asia Pacific importers.
Wood chips and particles have also increased in significance in trade relative to wood-based pulp production. In 1993, total trade was estimated at 31.8 million cubic meters. Japan, as the dominant importer, accounted for 22 million cubic meters imported, or 69.2 percent of the global total. The largest majority of Japan's imports originated in the USA (7.9 million cubic meters, 35.6 percent), Australia (6.3 million cubic meters, 28.5 percent), and Chile (3.6 million cubic meters, 16.5 percent). Japan absorbed almost all exports from these three countries. Germany, the fourth leading exporter at 2.1 million cubic meters traded primarily with Austria, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden within the European Community. Canada, the fifth leading exporter (1.6 million cubic meters) shipped almost equally to Japan and the USA. South Africa has emerged as a leading exporter at 1.1 million cubic meters, trading almost exclusively with Japan. Similarly, China and New
Zealand with combined exports of 1.7 million cubic meters were largely exporting to Japan. Russian trade was 659 thousand cubic meters, oriented towards Finland (439 thousand cubic meters) with smaller but growing trade with Japan (193 thousand cubic meters in 1993).
Trade in Paper, Paperboard and Newsprint was 48.2 million metric tons in 1993. Finland, Sweden and Germany were leading European exporters, with a total of 16.9 million metric tons (35 percent). Most of this trade was destined for Germany, UK, France and Italy. The USA and Canada exported 10.1 million metric tons (21 percent) primarily to each other (4.4 million metric tons) and to Japan, Hong Kong and China in the Asia Pacific region. France, Austria and the Netherlands were secondary European exporters, primarily within the European Community. Globally, Germany, the USA and UK were leading importers, together accounting for 32 percent of trade. France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain were also major European importers. China, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan accounted for 6.5 million metric tons, or 13.5 percent of global trade.
Information compiled by the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) showing the relative mix of imports by tropical and non-tropical categories is summarized in Table 35 for both 1992 and 1993. This table includes those countries that are considered as major importers of tropical timber products from ITTO member countries. In 1993, five importer countries (Brazil, Greece, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand) were reported as importing 100 percent tropical timber, although tropical volumes shown exceed reported "Import All" volumes. Additionally, four countries (Taiwan, Egypt, India and Portugal) had reported import shares of tropical timber above 80 percent. Brazil, Malaysia and the Philippines were reported as exclusive importers of tropical sawnwood, with the Republic of Korea and Thailand showing tropical import shares over 80 percent. Taiwan and India had import shares over 50 percent for tropical sawnwood. Ten countries had tropical import shares for veneer
sheets exceeding 50 percent, while 13 countries had tropical plywood shares above this level.

Tropical timber trade for 1993 is summarized by major importers and tropical timber type covering tropical logs (Table 36), sawnwood (Table 37), veneer (Table 38) and plywood (Table 39). Subtotals are indicated for European importers, while national totals are given for Australia, Japan, Singapore and the USA. Country import details by product and country of origin are given in Appendix 22 for the countries shown with the exception of the USA.
Major European importers accounted for 1.4 million cubic meters of tropical log imports in 1993, or 14.9 percent (Table 36). Japan imported 8 million cubic meters, or 84.6 percent of the total. Over 56 percent of European imports were the Okoume Group species, while for Japan the Red Meranti, White Lauan and Keruing group species were predominant. European imports of tropical sawnwood, at almost 2.1 million cubic meters, accounted for 51 percent by volume of all imports, while Japan and Singapore together accounted for 1.8 million cubic meters (45.7 percent) (Table 37). Europe accounted for the greatest share of tropical veneers (458 thousand cubic meters, 64.5 percent) with Japan received over 202 thousand cubic meters (28.5 percent) (Table 38). For Tropical Plywood (Table 39), European imports were 3.2 million cubic meters, or 43.7 percent with Japan accounting for over 3.3 million cubic meters (45.9 percent).
Reference to the country import summaries in Appendix 22 for the nine major tropical wood importers clearly indicates the dominant role of Indonesia and Malaysia in terms of volume trade. For the six major European importers (Belgium-Luxembourg, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, UK), Asia Pacific exporters provided an almost-insignificant share of tropical logs, ranging from 0.1 percent for France to 1.9 percent for the UK. Market shares were more variable for tropical veneer sheets, and ranged from only 0.7 percent for Belgium-Luxembourg to 23 percent for the UK. Indonesia was, however, the leading source of Asia Pacific veneer exports to France, Germany and Italy, while Malaysia was the leading supplier from Asia to the Netherlands and the UK.
Asia Pacific was of considerably greater significance to Europe's major importers for both tropical sawnwood and tropical plywood. For sawnwood, Asia Pacific share varied from a low of 28.1 percent for Italy and 29.5 percent for France to highs of 75.6 percent for the Netherlands, 72.5 percent for Germany, and 66.8 percent for Belgium-Luxembourg. Malaysia was the leading supplier to all the major European importers with the exception of Italy, where Indonesia was the top supplier, followed by Malaysia.
The situation with European plywood imports was equally dependent on Asia Pacific, where the import share from Asia ranged from a low of 35.5 percent for Italy to 80.2 percent for Germany, 70.3 percent for the UK, and 65 percent for both Belgium-Luxembourg and France. The Netherlands imported 57.2 percent of tropical plywood from Asia Pacific. In all cases, Indonesia was the dominant supplier, with Malaysia providing important but smaller shares in the Netherlands and the UK.

ITTO, Trade in Tropical Timber, 1993
Although strong in the European markets for tropical sawnwood and plywood, Asia Pacific producers totally dominated the major Asian markets of Australia, Japan and Singapore. Asia Pacific countries supplied the total import of tropical logs for Australia, 94.7 percent for Singapore, and 93.7 percent for Japan with Malaysia the dominant supplier, although Papua New Guinea was also important to Japan's import supply. Equally large shares of tropical sawnwood originated in the Asia Pacific region, falling between 97 and 98 percent for Australia, Japan and Singapore. Malaysia was the predominant supplier in each case. Although slightly less significant, Asia Pacific was the major supplier of tropical veneer sheets to these three markets, ranging from 84 percent for Australia to 98.7 percent for Japan and 99.5 percent for Singapore. In each case, Malaysia was the dominant supplier.
Asia Pacific trade in tropical plywood was almost complete, with 98.5 percent share in Singapore and over 99.5 percent for Japan and Australia. Indonesia dominated this trade, with Malaysia playing a much smaller secondary role with the exception of Singapore, where it was the leading supplier. Country by country trade flows for tropical products (logs, sawnwood, veneer, and plywood) for major Asia Pacific (plus US) and European importers as estimated by ITTO using FAO and member country data is provided in Appendix 23. Comparisons between FAO sources and importer/exporter data is provided in these tables, where ITTO member country data is shown separately in Italics. Significant differences appear for selected products/country flows, indicating that overall trade links need to be used with some caution. Nevertheless, the general patterns of trade are clearly evident in the above discussion and the detailed information contained in Appendices

<title>Pacific Rim demand and supply situation, trends and prospects: implications for forest products trade in the Asia-Pacific region. (Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study - Working Paper Series) APFSOS/WP/02</title>
<section>1</section>
Comprehensive scope for regional sector analysis
Based on this review, it is Recommended that future Regional Outlook assessments follow a broadened and comprehensive definition for the Region, along the lines of the scope utilized in the present review. The integration of tropical and non-tropical components, the conifer and non-conifer forests, the producer and consumers, and the developed and developing countries, and the "major" and "minor" players are all significant to a better understanding of the dynamics of the forest sector. Partial or limited perspectives will restrict the completeness of the review. Although it is perhaps easy to focus on the 'major' components of the sector, the development of scenarios (see below) requires inclusion of all aspects of the regional forestry sector on both the supply and demand sides. Dynamics and adjustments take place at the margin, and the interaction of all participants shape these adjustments.
<section>2</section>
Integrated databases for analysis
As would be indicated by the scope and extent of the extensive literature reviewed in the present study, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of databases by all parties. To a large extent, FAO has been the primary collector and developer of country specific data on forests (area and volumes) based on country input. Data on production and trade is also compiled by FAO. However, much of the work of specific outlook analysis requires ongoing efforts to collect and systematically utilize huge amounts of secondary data. Development of timber supply and market models are data intensive. ITTO has major responsibilities in data collection and synthesis, while other major organizations, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are the recipients of numerous studies and analysis of the forestry sector.
The comparison of study results and findings is often confused or hampered by the undocumented differences in underlying data, inconsistent 'base years' and differing inclusiveness or coverage. At best there is considerable overlap and duplication of effort in collection, maintenance, and processing of information relevant to the analysis of the forestry sector of the Asia Pacific region. At worst, confusion and conflicting findings or results can inhibit the progress toward a common goal of region-wide development of strategies and policies making the most productive use of the region's forest potential for improvement of the human condition recognizing the need for environmental responsibilities.
It is Recommended that a major effort be undertaken by the key international and national authorities to consolidate existing data sources and information reporting into a broader comprehensive system, maintained for common use and access, with timely updating based on country information and supplemented by regional studies and future findings. This can potentially be a decentralized effort but with formal coordination and procedures for open access so that individual analyses can proceed on a consistent and comparable basis.
<section>3</section>
Policy analysis
It is Recommended that a future Outlook Study specifically incorporate a major component to update and document rapidly changing forest policies for the Asia Pacific Region countries. The development of outlooks and scenarios will reflect critical elements of policy and the conditions for implementation as much as exogenous macro-economic trends and developments. Such factors must be identified and structured in a consistent manner relevant to incorporation into the analysis of future options rather than simply considered as parameters held constant over the outlook period and/or imposed as operational constraints.
The 'checklist' of policy groupings and sub-issues developed in this review can be supplemented from many other sources and through regional discussion and cooperation around areas of mutual concern. A major component of this recommended policy analysis should be, nevertheless, focused on the potentially significant impact of economic or market reforms which can profoundly reshape how forestry is undertaken and how production, consumption and trade evolves. Past patterns of sector performance will increasingly have little to contribute to an understanding of a significantly restructured forestry sector operating in a completely new macro-economic framework at both the country and regional level.
<section>4</section>
Fuelwood
Any future outlook assessment of the Asia Pacific Region must seriously incorporate and reflect the realities of the fuelwood component within the context of forest resource management and the industrial driven activities. It is Recommended that a specific fuelwood and energy analysis be included and integrated into the development of outlook scenarios. This should also form a major aspect of the recommended policy studies. Linkages with other sectors (energy policy, agriculture, land settlement, population) should also be explicitly built into this component, fully recognizing that the underlying issues are much broader than forestry.
<section>5</section>
Land use and competing non-timber forest products
Although a focus on timber is understandable as the most evident 'contribution' of the forest to national interests, the formal recognition of a much wider role of forests is required. As with fuelwood, the proper recognition of competing land uses and the role of non-timber forest products is frequently ignored or minimized in resource assessment and outlook analysis. The inclusion of environmental and conservation 'uses' of forests together with a wide range of 'minor' products (including tourism and other activities sustained in part by forests), watersheds, biodiversity, and related considerations into the analysis of sector development must realistically acknowledge the potential demands on forests in competition with timber production. It is Recommended that a structured component of a future Asia Pacific Resource Outlook be inclusive of these alternative forest uses and products and fully recognized as part of the 'output' matrix in terms of future trends and
opportunities.
<section>6</section>
Marketing, trade and trade policy
Central to the proposed Asia Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study is the need to analytically incorporate critical issues of marketing, trade and trade policies. Markets are not 'neutral' and responsive only to the lowest price. Efforts to influence demand through marketing practices, economic incentives and disincentives towards domestic objectives, trade distortions through trade barriers, and trends in country and regional trade policies need to be systematically investigated and incorporated formally into outlook analysis. It is Recommended that a analytical component of the proposed outlook be inclusive of these issues and linked to quantitative assessments of scenarios or projections of trends. Assessment of the sensitivity of trends to these factors through carefully developed scenario options specified in terms of individual country outlooks can assist in this phase of the assessment. Inclusion of indicators of comparative advantage at each level of processing in
terms of both costs and returns to resource owners would be helpful to assess responsiveness of individual countries to potential market shifts.
<section>7</section>
Sustainability as an international yardstick
As previously noted, the topic of sustainability is central to global debates regarding forest sector policies, whether expressed in terms of biodiversity and conservation or in the context of timber harvest levels. It is recommended that a carefully developed study component address the issues of definition, appropriate indicators or measurement of sustainability, and the means and transition policies that might be adopted (or imposed) in individual countries of the Asia Pacific Region. Conceptual and logical consensus on the probable scope and quantification of sustainability is critically needed, together with the feasibility of alternative means to obtain international cooperation in promoting the common interest. How sustainability is pursued and over what time horizon will be central to the Region's commercial forestry outlook.
<section>8</section>
Substitution and econometric analysis
It has been noted that substitution of all forms within the forest products markets of Asia Pacific will result in potentially large restructuring of both production and consumption, accompanied by various price impacts and economic incentives. Much of the analysis of these factors will revolve around a better understanding of the technical elasticity's of supply, demand, and cross-product substitution. Both technical and econometric efforts will be required to provide more timely, current and focused estimates of these dynamic factors based on comparative changes in relative prices between products as well as the evolution of alternative goods in meeting market requirements for changing end uses. Market segmentation, rather than commodity or product approaches, can potentially shed much light on the processes of substitution. It is Recommended that a study module be included in the proposed Outlook study dealing with substitution (technical and economic) and inclusive of
quantitative estimation of relevant measures of elasticity specific to the Asia Pacific Region.
<section>9</section>
Competition and potentials of perimeter players
In the present review, the role of 'perimeter players' in terms of potential additional sources of timber supply to supplement declining Regional supplies and/or the possible threat of competition in established markets has been noted. Overall, this review found that the possible increases in timber supply around the perimeter of the Asia Pacific Region are real but realistically limited in total volumes and almost entirely conifer. It is Recommended that an explicit analysis of such 'perimeter players' be included in a Asia Pacific Outlook assessment, to include supply potentials, competition for available supplies of both Asian and non-Asian sourced products, and as two-way trade partners. Russian timber, for example, may grow in availability but may be drawn to European or North American markets at the expense of declining supply to Asia. New Zealand might find more attractive markets elsewhere. Growth in domestic consumption outside of the Asian Pacific Rim will
profoundly impact direction of trade in increasingly competitive markets. Substitution within the Asia Pacific Region, as well as substitution in external markets traditionally served by Asia Pacific producers, will undoubtedly change in response to competitive forces driven by not only potential supply but potential consumption.

Prices for Asia Pacific forest products
Asian logs
Asian sawnwood
Asian plywood
One of the key determinants of forest products output and trade is price. Price is not a simple or single index, but rather a complex matrix of values expressed at different points in time, in either nominal or real (constant) terms, as related to either producers (origin) or end user (market). Prices vary by species, grade or quality, dimension, and many other variables that tend to differentiate value in a fluid and dynamic marketplace.
<section>b</section>
Asian logs
Recent trends in prices for major species and grades for Asian logs, expressed in constant 1990 US$ terms per cubic meter, as reported by ITTO are shown in Figure 29. Also shown for comparison are nominal or 'current' prices independent of inflation. Prices are exporter prices, normally expressed as FOB port of origin. Prices are aggregated across major traded grades and countries of export within the Asia Pacific Region. Aggregation is also made across size and quality categories. A listing of species traded by country with average prices (US$/cum) and volume exported is contained in Appendix 24. Appendix 24 also includes a listing of Log grade categories as identified in Figure 29.

Source: ITTO. 1996. Annual review and assessment of the world tropical timber situation 1995.
As shown in Figure 29, there is a vector of prices prevailing for export logs in Asia, differentiated by species and grade over time. Shorea spp. (Red Seraya, Balau, or Meranti) is the largest export by species reported by ITTO, followed by Dryobalanops spp. (Kapur) and Dipterocarpus spp. (Keruing). Asian logs generally experienced a sharp increase in late 1992 and into the first half of 1993. Overall, prices increased by as much as 300 percent during this period. For most species, however, the increase was somewhat short lived, with prices dropping back to near pre-mid 1992 levels by late 1994 and into 1995. Inflation had taken a bite from real prices, as distinguished between the dark (constant) and lighter (nominal) trends shown. The main exception to this pattern is the price for Balau (Shorea glauca) which largely maintained the higher price level in nominal terms but saw a small reduction in constant price due to inflation.
Shorea spp (Meranti), Dryobalanops spp. (Kapur) and Dipterocarpus spp. (Keruing) all reveal quite similar pricing trends. While price was at or near US$ 100/cum from mid-1990 through mid 1992 (as was Balau), price spikes in the last half of 1992 and early 1993 peaked at about US$ 350/cum to US$ 400/cum, thereafter falling back to about US$ 200/cum or less (constant) by late 1994. This is consistent for Balau as well, although the evident price spike did not occur in this case. Shorea spp. (Meranti) prices have declined the most, to about US$ 150/cum. Price for Kasai closely followed that for Meranti, reaching prices below US$ 150/cum after late 1994.
Figure 29 also illustrates the partial effect of grade sorting. Prices for mixed logs from both Papua New Guinea and Sarawak were lower in the mid-1990 to late 1992 period, closer to US$ 50/cum, about half the price for the sorted standard-fair grades shown. Price spikes did take place, but reached highs closer to US$ 200/cum rather that the US$ 300-350/cum for graded species. Price declines (in constant terms) have seen unsorted mix log price fall back to near US$ 100/cum through 1995.
The rapid spike in prices, together with the equally sharp drops (in most cases) undoubtedly led to disappointment in expectations regarding the future for export logs. While late 1995 prices are above those levels prevailing in 1990-92, much of the apparent gain has been given back, with the 1994-95 trend generally flat (Kasai, Balau, Keruing) to declining (Meranti, Kapur) at year end 1995.

Asian sawnwood
Similar price trends for Asian sawnwood in both current (nominal) and constant 1990 values are shown in Figure 30. Identification of the major sawnwood species, with volume and price for 1992-93 is included in Appendix 24. The major species exported are Shorea spp (Meranti), Gonystylus bancanus (Ramin), Dryobalanops spp (Kapur), and Dipterocarpus spp (Keruing).

Exporter price is the most complete for Dark Red Meranti, Selects and Better Kiln Dried. This species accounted for approximately one-third of the volume reported by ITTO for the select countries reported as shown in Appendix 24. Prices rose from US$ 400/cum to about US$ 550/cum (constant) from mid 1990 to early 1993. Price then increased rapidly to about US$ 800/cum (constant) in mid 1993 and remained at this level into early 1994. Thereafter, sawnwood price for this grade declined, most sharply in early 1995, reaching levels near or below US$ 600/cum at the end of 1995. This represented a gain of some 45 percent (constant) over mid 1990, but a drop of more than 20 percent from the highs achieved in 1993-94. Data is more limited and discontinuous for Balau and Keruing, yet indicate prices well below the Dark Red Meranti. Balau prices (constant) have been relatively stable near US$ 400/cum since mid 1994 with no significant trend. Keruing price has drifted downward after
late 1993. While approximately equal to the price of Balau at early 1994, by the end of 1995 Keruing was about US$ 300/cum, or US$ 100/cum below Balau in constant terms.
Price for Light Red Meranti, Selects and Better, Kiln Dried are much more discontinuous as reported, yet closely follow the trend for Dark Red Meranti. Price spiked to US$ 800/cum in late 1993 (a few months later than the price spike for Dark Red Meranti), but rapidly declined to nearer US$ 700/cum before again climbing to near US$ 800/cum briefly in late 1994. Price at mid 1995 appears to be near US$ 600/cum and declining.

Asian plywood
Exporter prices for Asian Plywood by major exporter country are shown in Figure 31 for the period 1990-95 in both current and constant US$ per cubic meter. Indonesia, as the primary exporter of plywood dominates export pricing. Prices in early 1990-mid 1993 averaged about US$ 375/cum with the exception of a sharp drop to about US$ 250/cum in early 1992. After early 1993, prices climbed to just under US$ 500/cum, and thereafter trended downward through late 1994 when price was again near the US$ 375 level (constant) evident in 1991-92. Data is not reported after mid 1994, although prices for exports from Indonesia to Japan are given for two grades based on C&F. This information is derived from Japan sources and expressed also in US$/cum. Price for half inch panels climbed from just over US$ 200/cum in mid 1992 to a peak of about US$ 425/cum in mid 1993, thereafter drifting downward to below US$ 400 for most of 1994 ant to US$ 350375/cum into most of 1995. Prices for thin
panels (C&F) were markedly higher, at about US$ 350/cum (constant) through 1992, climbing sharply in 1993 to over US$ 650/cum, and then declining almost as rapidly to US $450/cum by early 1994. Price continued to decline, reaching US$ 400/cum (constant) by the end of 1994. A moderate recovery was underway into 1995, with price reaching about US$ 450 late in the year.

The price for plywood (FOB) for Malaysia compares favorably with that for Indonesia for most of the 1990-94 period. Price for early 1994 was at about US$ 400/cum, bur rather more stable than the decline experienced in Indonesia at the time. Both countries experienced peaks of near US$ 500/cum (constant) at mid-1993 thus losing about 20 percent by late 1994.
Exporter, or producer prices differ from market price for timber users, particularly where distance and shipping create a premium on market access. Further, prices in the seller currency is greatly affected by movements in exchange rates. Given the strong role played by Japan in trade flows and markets for the Asia Pacific Region, trends in Japan are frequently reflected in terms of competition between potential sellers. Changes in Japan's market prices are effectively transmitted backward to sellers, based on the derived price expectation net of sales, shipping and other transaction costs. Finally, exchange rate adjustments must be taken into account.
Table 40 provides a short history of wholesale log prices in Japan (normally port of entry or wholesale market) expressed in Japanese Yen/CUM. Annual prices are averages for the twelve months. The column "D-P.M" represents the period change from the prior column entry. As seen for the majority of species, with the exception of 1993 there were relatively modest upward movements in prices for the 1991-95 period. Prices for most log species peaked in 1993, then fell to levels frequently near the 1991-92 levels. One exception was Lauan logs for lumber production, which reached a peak of 62,900 Yen/cum in 1993 but which has subsequently declined by a much smaller margin, stabilizing in the 59-60,000 yen/cum range for most of 1995. As would be expected, the peak of log prices, particularly for non-conifer lumber, experienced in 1993 contributed to the peak exporter prices for Asia Pacific producers as discussed above. Lauan log prices for plywood production have shown a lower
wholesale price in Japan than logs for lumber, in many periods being about one-half. Plywood Lauan log prices also increased sharply in 1993, up by 14,100 yen/cum from 1992 to a level of 41,800 yen/cum. This level gave way to strong declines in 1994 and 1995, with January 1996 price at 28,200 yen/cum, only slightly above 1992 levels.
Comparable Japan wholesale price data for manufactured products is shown in Table 41. For sawnwood products, prices are expressed at yen/cum while for plywood price is yen/sheet for the dimensions and grade shown for each column. For the sawnwood products shown, prices peaked again in 1993, with Lauan boards reaching a wholesale price level of 186,800 yen/cum in 1993. This trend continued into 1994 when prices were 191,900 yen/cum. This level prevailed into early 1995, with price declines frequently offset by increases on a month-to-month basis throughout the year. For January 1996, the wholesale price for Lauan boards was at 188,800 yen/cum, only slightly off the peak of 1994.
Japan wholesale prices for Lauan plywood remained much more stable over the 1991-95 period for the three sizes/grades reported. Price for 90 cm x 1.8 m "Type 1" panels for concrete forming reached 1,470 yen/sheet in 1993, consistent with the price trends for most other products and markets. Price declined however in 1994 and 1995, resulting in a January 1996 price very close to that prevailing in 1991. This pattern was also experienced by the other two panel grades reported, but at lower price levels. In both cases, January 1996 price was comparable to 1991 average wholesale prices. Price trends for Lauan plywood and sawnwood products are quite closely linked to the trends noted above for comparable logs.

Table 40 and Table 41 also imply that there is a relationship between prices for different species and grades. While not uniform, prices represent perceived differences between value in end uses where timber is matched with the desired attributes for specific uses. These differences in price largely persist even when the overall timber market adjusts upwards or down in response to macro economic developments and conditions of supply. In Table 40, all species of logs lost value in 1994-95 although the proportional decline varied relative to the 1993 peaks. This was also the case for sawnwood and plywood in Table 41 with the exception of Lauan logs for lumber as previously noted. Thus market movements are largely pervasive, with incremental movements modifying overall market changes for individual commodities.
Asia Pacific wood producers are also in competition with other major producer regions, particularly for tropical hardwoods. Figure 32 illustrates some of the changing price conditions prevailing in the 1990-93 period for tropical sawnwood. During most of 1990-91, Asian producers received the lowest prices (exporter price, FOB) among the three major tropical timber producer regions. In effect, Asia Pacific was the 'low cost supplier'. During this period, prices for producers in Africa and Latin America declined, although Latin America Prices suddenly surged in late spring 1991, exceeding US$ 800/cum for a brief period before resuming a declining trend to the end of 1992. During much of 1992 prevailing prices were relatively stead with the Asia Pacific price midway between African and Latin America prices at about US$ 600/cum. As previously noted, Asia Pacific prices surged in 1993, making this region the high cost supplier by the end of the year, in part contributing to
pressures for price cuts in order to maintain competitiveness in the major tropical sawnwood markets (particularly Japan).

An objective of the present study was to review the great wealth of published materials and reports regarding the forestry sector in the Asia Pacific Region relative to systematically identifying the critical or key issues confronting the Region. Almost one hundred major sources were identified and examined whenever possible relative to major coverage by country and issues or problems identified.^7 In addition, approximately one hundred other references were identified as Supplementary Sources which relate to forestry in the Asia Pacific Region or to individual countries or issues. Undoubtedly, these extensive materials are not complete with respect to the current knowledge and reporting for the Asia Pacific Region. However, it is felt that the critical issues and problems have been sufficiently identified to chart direction for future research and analysis oriented to an integrated synthesis of the dynamics and outlook for the Region recognizing the great differences and
diversity which exists within the sub-regions and individual countries.
^7 See the Bibliography for citations to the key references utilized in the present review. Also see the listing of Supplemental Sources for additional citations to materials related to the Asia Pacific forestry sector or individual countries within the region.
Table 42 provides a summary of the approximate distribution of emphasis by country within the literature and sources examined. As indicated here, the coverage by sub-region and country is somewhat more limited and fragmented than was the case for the baseline analytical studies noted in Appendix Table 1. Thus the focus on issues and problems is frequently more antidotal and specific to one or a few countries. Here, the primary goal is to provide a generalized framework for issue identification applicable to the Asia Pacific Region as a whole, fully recognizing the important differences in practice dealing with the specific settings within the Region.
A general categorization of Issues confronting the Asia Pacific Region is set out in Table 43. A tabulation of these categories and sub-issues cross-listed by selected reference sources is included with the bibliography. Not all primary references cited in the Bibliography were specifically indexed, and the individual references provided as Supplementary Sources were not included in this listing. The tabulation simply provides a visual impression of the convergence of findings of widely differing sources and authors who are familiar with the Asia Pacific Region and concerned about the future of the forestry sector.

Forest policies
Perhaps the most pervasive issue identified relates to the broad role and adequacy of forest policies for the several countries of the Asia Pacific Region. Sub-issues involve the specification of goals and objectives for the forestry sector, the setting of priorities, the examination and selection of strategies for achieving policies, and the measurement and assessment of the effectiveness of policy implementation in achieving the desired goals.
The Asian Development Bank analysis of the forestry situation in the Asia Pacific region summarized the status of National Policies for a number of the individual countries. This summary is shown as Table 44. National policies have generally been examined and updated within the past decade. Yet the ADB review indicates that policy is still very much evolving given the status of political and economic change within the Region. The ADB identified four areas where policy direction is needed (Jaakko Poyry, 1995):
1) Classification of and terms of access to forest resources,
2) Sustainable management and development of forest resources,
3) utilization of forest-based products, and
4) the surrounding institutional framework and linkages with other sectors
While forest policies may be adequate in terms of stating general principles, a primary weakness is in the actual implementation and interpretation of direction in practice. Successful strategies, based on realistic priorities are required to implement policy directives.
Development strategies
The problem of policy implementation leads directly to widespread concern regarding the development of strategies to implement policy and to deal with new and complex problems confronting the forestry sector. A broad series of "Strategic Plans" have been developed within the Asia Pacific Region under either the Master Plan or Tropical Forestry Action Programme (TFAP) processes to carry out a systematic analysis of the forestry sector and to formulate policy strategies and programmes for implementation. Table 45 summarizes the scope of these reviews as of 1995.
Legislation
Policy, to be effective, must be clearly recorded in statutory language consistent with the systems and culture where it is to be made effective. Beyond basic forest policy statements, fundamental 'forestry laws' are frequently enacted detailing the various purposes and means for carrying out policy. Issues of the role and responsibility of government and governmental institutions, rights and privileges of resource use, budgeting and staffing, numerous other aspects of sector policy need to be carefully crafted to clarify intent and means for achieving sector results. In practice, legislation is frequently piecemeal and overlapping, partly formal legislation and partly administrative decree or regulation, and possibly lacking in the specifics needed to adequately judge the relevance and probability of achieving desired goals. Consolidation and codifying of legislation, administrative decrees, and related rules and regulations may reveal shortcomings and problem areas where
policy is not effectively implemented or where substantial gains might be anticipated in efficiency and performance of the forestry sector.

Tariff/trade barrier
Another important role of government impacting the forest sector is in the regulation and direction for economic trade between nations. This is no less so than for the forestry sector of the Asia Pacific region. Trade barriers can be economic in the form of tariffs, duties and other surcharges related to transactions (either import or export) or can be non-tariff-barriers in the form of rules and regulations as to how commerce is conducted. In either case, countries have many 'reasons' to impose barriers, primarily to protect perceived components of their economic base. Policies to discourage or restrict imports in favor of domestic activity are commonplace, seeking to preserve self interests at the risk of lower overall economic efficiency and welfare. Likewise, policies designed to prohibit or limit exports are seen as means to reallocate resources, often with a preference for greater processing or utilization for domestic consumption.
Trade barriers in the Asia Pacific region have been well studied by Bourke (1988) and others. While barriers have been generally reduced, a pattern often persists of reduced barriers for lower valued, commodity grade trade while maintaining progressively higher barriers for semi-processed or finished goods. This is particularly likely in the case of import tariffs designed to protect and/or promote secondary processing opportunities.
A summary of trade barriers perceived to operate for major ITTO consumer countries is reproduced in Table 46. As illustrated, a pattern of duties and tariffs, at higher levels for processed products is evident for the Netherlands and Korea, for example. Quotas for imports are also imposed in the European Union for plywood. To the extent that trade barriers exist, trade is restricted and markets distorted. Government policies favoring more open trade is widely promoted as desirable for the Asia Pacific forestry sector. Trading blocs are emerging in many parts of the world, opening trade on a localized basis. Movements towards assuring open market access to and by Asia Pacific nations will remain a long term issue requiring action by governments at all levels. Questions of 'certification' of timber by origin or sustainability is frequently seen as a trade barrier and at best a potential threat to established trade in spite of well-intentioned policies aimed at assuring long
term sustained forests.

Conservation of forest resources and land use
Reforestation
Wildlife and timber reserves
The second major grouping of forest sector issues surrounds the question of conservation of forest resources and the related issues of land use. As with all nations, the countries of the Asia Pacific Region face questions regarding the priority of land use in the face of dense populations, generally low levels of economic development and social wellbeing. Land is being converted to alternative, non-forestry uses as indicated by the statistics on deforestation. Cut-over lands are left idle and forests are degraded as local residents seek improvements in daily living if only temporarily achieved by land clearing, gathering of fuelwood, or premature harvesting for a subsistence income or personal local utilization.
Forest land has traditionally been defined based on a combination of current use and biological potential or capacity. Less frequently economic criteria setting priorities for land allocation have been utilized. The process of dynamic land use and periodic changes in the face of changed local conditions and priorities have frequently 'locked in' definitions of "forests" almost to the exclusion of consideration of relative land use values. Forest land use is also closely tied to legal and political issues of land tenure and ownership. Most frequently forest land is considered as a State responsibility, subject to governmental decision-making and control. Less frequently private ownership arrangements are allowed to shape or influence forest use.
Reforestation
A primary issue related to forests in the Asia Pacific Region is linked to the extent of forest cover - often tied to a historic or "planned" target level. Barren forest land, or degraded forests represent a loss of potential productivity and economic gain. Restoring forest vegetation to such lands, and the improvement of stocking or stand conditions is primary in many national forest sector strategies within the Region.
Reforestation has perhaps been driven by commercial timber interests, where achieving high rates of forest growth are central to maintaining or increasing timber harvest and correlated production of forest products. However, forests are increasingly seen as promoting many national and international objectives, including soil conservation, protection of habitats, watershed maintenance, and related conservation and environmental purposes. As noted in this report, the establishment of forest plantations is more frequently related to these objectives for forest cover rather than a strict product or utilitarian purpose. As also noted - in terms of total timber harvest and use, fuelwood remains the leading use of wood throughout the Asia Pacific region, outstripping industrial uses by a wide margin. Strategies for reforestation and afforestation that are purpose-driven with non-timber objectives will in all likelihood grow in importance within the Region, requiring new approaches
and means to achieve the intended objectives. At the same time, land use policies may dictate that not all previously-forested lands can be simply assumed to be desirable or necessary for reforestation given land use pressures and other competing land uses. Economic justification for the strategies of reforestation and afforestation need to be clearly established and linked to specific policy objectives and goals, allowing for the potential for competing interests. Prioritization of efforts based on goals will be certainly needed in the future as investment resources will be scarce. Institutional arrangements for reforestation and afforestation will need reexamination in light of changing social conditions and concepts of land tenure rights.
Wildlife and timber reserves
Conservation goals, broadly defined, recognize that certain lands and forests have potentially greater value in non-timber use. Such alternative uses may require mutually-exclusive land allocation, as is frequently done in the case of wildlife reserves, many parks and primitive/wilderness reserves, watersheds, or related areas. Maintenance of habitat for species of endangered wildlife or flora is a growing national and international concern. Strategies and policies to efficiently recognize these interests in the allocation of available forest lands and resources directly impact the nature and level of timber-related activities. Where total independence in use is not required, increased restrictions and constraints on forest management for timber purposes can be anticipated (see discussion of "Sustainability" below). Multipurpose forestry will in all likelihood grow in importance throughout the Asia Pacific region as it has in North America and Europe. The preservation of
forest ecosystems and 'wilderness' areas can be expected to rise on government agendas, reflecting both domestic and international concerns about resource conservation.
<section>h</section>
Forest stand management
Biodiversity
Sustainability
Deforestation/degradation of forests
Large areas of forest in the Asia Pacific region will undoubtedly continue to be allocated for timber related purposes. A large number of issues surround the future use and management of these lands, however. Management will, as noted above, increasingly be multi-purpose, imposing constraints on how timber objectives are to be pursued. Seven sub-issues have been identified related to this topic.
Biodiversity
Forests are increasingly seen as complex ecosystems where the woody tree species are but a part of a more significant whole. Pressures for the maintenance of component ecosystems is widely accepted as legitimate, even at the cost of lower productive efficiency or long term output. To a large extent, the non-conifer forests of Asia Pacific are seen as complex structures systematically undergoing selective degradation for commercial exploitation of the more highly valuable components at the risk of reduced long term biodiversity. As forestry in the Region continues a transition from natural forest exploitation towards sustainable managed forest systems, the role of more uniform managed stands (including the incorporation of exotics) will be questioned. Equity issues surrounding biodiversity maintenance and enhancement can place domestic interests in economic development in conflict with broader international conservation interests. Mechanisms of cost sharing and compensation
will likely emerge as major aspects of working out of acceptable international standards and incentives for biodiversity and conservation of forest ecosystems. Working definitions of practical concepts of biodiversity, sensitive to domestic needs, and strategies for setting local, national, regional, and global priorities will confront policy makers at each level.
The degree to which forest management is compatible with biodiversity and preservation of ecosystems will itself become a much larger policy issue. Is a managed forest meaningfully 'diverse'? Are natural systems always 'better'? Biodiversity, if achievable through forest management interventions will certainly differ from conventional approaches oriented towards volume of growth and value maximization over time.
Sustainability
Forest conservation and management in the next century will be headlined by issues of sustainability. Forests in many parts of the world have been approached from the perspective of utilizing or extracting values for society from a naturally accumulated 'stock' resource. A form of 'mining', this approach sought to transform huge accumulations of timber and forest capital to other forms of wealth represented by the diverse forest products menus around the globe. A combination of concerns regarding the long term productivity of forests (however measured), inter-generational distribution of wealth, and trade-offs between commodity and non-commodity values and components of forest system have firmly grabbed front page attention over the past decade and command lead recognition in almost any forum seriously engaged in forestry planning and decision-making. The conversion from natural forest/stock extraction towards man-made managed/production forest remains unfinished and poorly
understood around the world in spite of considerable public debate and attention. Numerous major conferences and workshops of policy makers, professionals and the public have highlighted the concerns and fears regarding sustainability.^8 "Agenda 21" is now a recognized short-hand for the numerous issues surrounding the concern for conservation of forests and sustainable management. The debate is ongoing regarding definitions and measurement of 'sustainability' in forestry, but the issue is without question central to the future of the forestry sector. Most immediately, resolution of the diverse concepts of sustainability will heighten national sensitivity to concerns about harvest rates and methods, both critical to the continued production, consumption and trade in forest products, and directly linked to this the flow of economic benefits to various producer and consumer groups.
^8 The publication "After UNCED: Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Forest Principles in Asia and the Pacific" (FAO, 1995) is an excellent and thoughtful analysis of the issues surrounding sustainability as well as many other policy related issues confronting the Region. This report should be central to any discussion of policy matters affecting the Asia Pacific forestry sector development and planning.
Deforestation/degradation of forests
Closely associated with forest management are the many issues surrounding the trends in deforestation (including land use conversions) and degradation of remaining forests. Maintaining a forest land base of high productivity is central to achieving and continuing high level sustainable timber production. The smaller the land base available to the forestry sector the lower the sustainable output that can reasonably be achieved given all other factors and consideration. Likewise, a degraded forest is simply less productive than a healthy, fully stocked, and well protected forest. Excessive pressures for forest utilization in the near term can be 'met' by over-exploitation of current forest stocks, resulting in a longer-term decline in productivity. Forests can be sustained, but only at a reduced level under such conditions. Conditions of land tenure, investment of capital and labor, and distributional issues surrounding forest rents and economic returns over time are central
to the infrastructure required for successful approaches to this downward spiral. Divergence between regulation and incentives as strategies for enhancing the role of forest management under such conditions has been only recently recognized as a significant issue. Means of organization and institutional capacity, including participation of local peoples and the private sector, are largely untapped in the Asia Pacific Region beyond the major developed countries. Productive forests, of course, depends upon the scope and purpose of use. "Fully stocked" for timber purposes can be quite different than when fuelwood or soil conservation is the primary objective.
Causes of degradation and deforestation are also critical to dealing with these issues. Institutional arrangements, tenure, beneficiary participation, etc. all create the decision-making environment of those close to the land. Protection of forests, in the broadest sense, is required if maintenance of productive and healthy forest is to be achieved. Many of the contributing causes of deforestation and degradation are external to the forestry sector, including socio-economic variables such as population, population growth, density, levels of economic development, per capita incomes, etc. These factors dictate that solutions and approaches cannot be simple sector based or forestry technology absent the proper identification of the more pervasive causes.
<section>i</section>
Agroforestry
Harvest levels
Forest fire and forest protection
Land use and watershed management
Agroforestry is not so much of an 'issue' as it is an alternative often proposed for dealing with specific land use issues. Traditionally, forestry and agriculture have been viewed as opposites, competing for the same property in many instances. On-site conflicts in use have largely resulted in land use classifications that place particular lands into 'forest lands' or 'agriculture'. Further, the integration of interdependent uses such as forest plantations for timber and livestock grazing, watersheds and recreation, wildlife and livestock is most frequently passed over in preference to simpler 'single or dominant' use land allocations. Agroforestry in the broadest sense is simply an approach to promote joint management of resources for multiple purposes based on the specific requirements of each option, with the outcome neither the maximization of any single use but a combination of uses. Where much of the land base is rural and tied to local populations, integration of
local responsibility for a greater degree of management direction seeks to involve those who are impacted by decisions and to internalize the incentive systems to promote cooperation rather than opposition to government mandated 'rules'. Much of Asia Pacific forestry takes place in the context of mixed land use, with relatively less forest in large, undisturbed tracks. Efforts to confront the realities of population and the legitimate needs for economic benefits point to the need to look at all options and combinations of management including new and innovative tenure arrangements. Local farmers on the land are the obvious starting point. While a large number of government-controlled schemes in agroforestry, social forestry, community forestry, etc. have been implemented, success in Asia is mixed at best with a widespread view that local people cannot be trusted with resources without central government controls and ultimate responsibility. This perceptions is discussed
further in relation to broader issues under Socio-Economic and Environmental Issues.
Harvest levels
Forest Management is conceptually oriented to bringing the forest to maturity in a productive and healthy state, allowing for the maximum extraction of product and value for society without diminishing the future productivity of the land resource to sustain future flows of benefits of the same or modified form. Where timber products are involved, the measure of output is typically expressed in the 'sustainable allowable cut' or sustainable harvest level. Throughout the Asia Pacific Region, questions are seriously raised regarding the appropriateness of current and/or recent levels of harvest. As discussed earlier in this review, the Asia Pacific Region as seen total roundwood production increase from 891.3 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 1,131.8 million cubic meters in 1994. To many, the answer is obvious - this level cannot be sustained.
Past levels of harvest based on the exploitation of natural forest stocks is, in this view, out of balance with the productive capacity of a shrinking forest land base. Large stocks of mature timber on existing natural forest areas are greater than the comparable volume on the same areas under prudent and economic management. Hence it is entirely possible to remove more timber in the short run than can be replaced under a planned, managed forest regime appropriate to the specific site conditions. Further, if management is not optimal, yields will be less than under ideal management regimes. Finally, if the available land base is reduced a lower level of harvest is dictated because of the smaller productive base.
This is true for both even-aged and uneven-aged (selective) forms of management. Widely differing perspectives as to the appropriate land base, the appropriate intensity and form of management, and the phasing of use of the accumulated natural timber stocks during the period of transition from natural forest exploitation to forests managed on sustainable principles affords great uncertainty regarding 'appropriate' harvest levels now and for the near term. Pressures for significant land use changes for environmental and conservation reasons have the potential for reducing the long term production potential even further. Constraints on managed forests to assure multiple outputs and environmental protection will likewise reduce future yields. The magnitude of these adjustments have yet to be fully understood and displayed in a manner that the public and decision-makers can comprehend the options available. It is highly likely that there will be less forests available for purely
production management in the future, and that added environmental and conservation constraints will be placed on that management. The degree to which these actions and their impacts can be offset through higher yield intensive management, fast growing plantations, or other alternatives is quite unclear. Consensus views, however, seem to suggest reductions, potentially large reductions, from current and recent harvests in several key countries of the Asia Pacific Region. Malaysia, as a dominant producer and trader of forest products is central to this debate, and the outcome will largely shape the dynamics of the Region into the next century.
Forest fire and forest protection
Growing a forest, unfortunately, is only one step towards maintaining a highly productive forest estate in the Asia Pacific Region. A large but unknown amount of otherwise productive timber is lost through fire and other destructive agents including pest and disease. Although some salvage or recovery of such losses is possible (for example the huge 1987 fires in China), such losses reduce the volume of useful timber entering the economies of the region. Forest protection is a fundamental component of forest management, from the earliest stages of plantations to the efficient harvesting and removal of usable materials from logging sites. Reductions in such losses or damage directly translate into higher yields. Protection from fire and other sources of damage is a costly investment, and must be weighed against the potential gains. Addressing issues surrounding wasteful forms of management and the lack of forest protection is in the end one of the most promising forms of
timber conservation and efficiency. Under conditions of exploitation of stocks of natural forests perhaps such losses were consistent with the marginal costs of extended mining of available stocks. However, with the transition to tree farming, the cost of growing incremental volumes of timber over relatively long periods of time at the margin may well exceed added costs for gains in forest protection.
Land use and watershed management
Many issues of land use have been mentioned in the previous sections. Withdrawing forest lands wholly or partially from timber production obviously impacts productivity and ultimate harvests. Land conversions may be detrimental to the calculated forest productive base, yet may sustain greater social benefits in alternate use. Foresters have been reluctant to acknowledge this fact, and generally perceive land use changes as detrimental. In part? this may be attributable to un-stated beliefs that forests also simultaneously contribute multiple 'intangible' and environmental benefits beyond the measurable timber yields.
Forest management, at least from the traditional planning perspective, has given way to integrated 'unit management' or 'watershed level' planning in many parts of the world. This concept both raises the scale of planning to larger land units, often taking in to account multiple ownership's and/or land uses, but also seeks to integrate multiple goals and objectives for management beyond timber. Forests, and timber management, become part of the fabric of goals for the larger integrated unit. Agriculture, livestock grazing, wildlife, recreation, soil and water conservation, and other objectives are seen as a multiple-goal planning process, each legitimate but yet subject to constraints and tradeoffs with the management scope as a whole. Separate, discrete land use classifications, each independently pursued (often by different local authorities) increasingly is viewed as too limiting and often failing due to ignoring the claims and goals of competing interests.
Competition for land in the Asia Pacific region is frequently intense. As forests are under pressures from other uses, the need to recognize non-timber outputs and values will increase in importance. As a result, timber dominant management can be expected to give way to constrained management whereby forests are managed for multiple benefits. Debates regarding the extent, scope, and condition of forests will require broader definitions and more inclusive measurement variables than simple area and volume statistics. Questions of forest health, biodiversity, productivity for multiple uses, etc. will be increasingly based on 'natural' land units such as watersheds which will blur the distinctions of 'forest' and 'non-forest' as traditionally used in forestry analysis and planning.

Forest products and industry
Forest products
Non-wood forest products
Forest processing
Research and institutions
Large scale forest industry & investment
Small scale forest industry
The fourth general category of issues confronting the forestry sector in the Asia Pacific Region include those dealing with the composition, status and strategies for the conversion of forest yields into products. The focus has, of course, been primarily on the conversion of timber into marketable commodities, yielding both consumptive values for local markets as well as the direct and indirect benefits of income generation, employment and, frequently, government revenues.
Forest production can be simple and un-organized, as in the case of subsistence collection of firewood, fodder or poletimber for immediate family use, or highly organized and institutionalized through business organizations and formal markets. In either case, the efficiency and competitiveness of this productive process largely determines the long term status of the forest resource base and the degree to which sustainability can be obtained.
Forest products
As noted in the review of the Asia Pacific Region, the most basic forest product has been roundwood. A fundamental decision is made as to whether roundwood will be 'marketed' in unprocessed form, or rather subjected to further conversion prior to marketing. Non-industrial uses of timber, including fuelwood and much local subsistence use is unorganized and functions without the traditional forms of 'industry' or markets.
A major concern throughout Asia Pacific is the extent to which processing of forest products can be competitive in lieu of simple harvesting and export of unprocessed timber. Questions of comparative advantage have historically revolved around issues of natural forest stocks and low-cost labor. These 'advantages' often led to profitable export of roundwood when the establishment of industrial infrastructure was not feasible. "Local" processing has been frequently at small scale, with limited technology, and oriented towards serving limited local needs.
Both producers of roundwood and consumers/importers are vitally interested in the economics of forest products conversion and comparative advantage. Both seek opportunities to 'capture' the benefits of primary and secondary processing for the benefit of local income generation and employment. Traditionally, converted forest products have followed a typical hierarchy from simple forms of solid wood such as sawnwood to partially restructured wood as veneers and panels, and further to various re-constituted products such as particleboard and fiberboard. Alternatively, wood may flow directly into primary fiber utilization through pulping and potentially paper and paperboard.
Increasingly, the choice of forest products strategies depends upon both local comparative advantage as well as global concerns related to markets, potential competitors (both traditional forest products and non-wood substitutes), and prices and capital movements. The simple availability of roundwood supply is no longer sufficient to determine forest products strategies. Technology, capital, transportation, and scope and scale of markets continue to erode traditional advantages based on raw material and labor.
Non-wood forest products
Forests traditionally have yielded many products and values other than timber and commodity products. Uses vary greatly by location and forest type, but all forms of 'minor forest products' have been important to forest dwellers in support of subsistence and 'cottage industry' yielding marketable products and/or goods for community barter. In numerous instances, development of forest products industry has displaced or constrained opportunities for non-wood forest products, with strong implications as to the equity or distributional consequences of forest use. In parts of Asia Pacific where population pressures are extreme and land settlement has resulted in substantial intrusion into forests, social pressures of displacing traditional 'subsistence use' can lead to conflict and continuing problems of forest protection against illegal or unauthorized uses. Since a large proportion of non-wood forest products do not enter formal markets these uses are treated as 'secondary' or
'minor' in spite of the importance to local peoples.
Non-wood forest products are increasingly viewed as options for local development as means for greater self-sustaining economic capacity. Local, small scale 'industry' serving local consumption needs and supporting local employment is increasingly seen as an alternative to large scale industrial development. New procedures for resource assessment, which fully recognize the potential for such uses need to be incorporated into forest sector strategies along with conventional forest products assessment.
Forest processing
As noted previously, the capacity of the Asia Pacific Region to produce timber is linked to the size of the forest estate, the local forest conditions, the levels of forest management and protection, and increasingly the sustainable long term productivity based on investments and management as supplements to natural forest yields. Many issues surrounding the determinants of forest capacity, both short and long term, have been noted. Another important issue for the Region relates to where that timber will be processed. Intra-regional as well as external trade beyond the Asia Pacific Region will reflect both national priorities and strategies as well as the comparative economic advantages at each stage of processing prior to end use consumption.
Each country has a nature! incentive to accomplish as much processing as possible within the local economy regardless of the location of final market. Products may be consumed in other Asia Pacific sub-regions and countries in addition to the domestic market.
The export of unprocessed roundwood is increasingly politically unwelcome in producer countries due to considerations of "value added" processing. On the other hand, consumer countries may well prefer access to unprocessed materials for a wide variety of reasons, including the generation of income and employment within their economies. However, only a finite production capacity is required in total to satisfy the needs of conversion of appropriate industrial roundwood into sawnwood products.
Protection measures including both import and export barriers to trade distort markets at each level. When imposed on roundwood trade, such barriers involve subsidies to existing and new capacity which would otherwise yield to greater efficiencies elsewhere. Problems of excess capacity are frequently compounded by lack of competitiveness in technology, economies of scale, marketing and distribution systems that are inefficient, and other chronic inhibitors of processing efficiencies. Where individual country capacity exceeds local market requirements, inefficiencies due to protection of industry processing will ultimately contribute to limited international competitiveness. Alternatively, the opening of markets and reductions in barriers carries the risk of industrial restructuring, changing the comparative advantages for different stages or levels of industrial processing, imposing short term threats to established patterns of timber utilization and trade. Regional
cooperation and strategies for mutual benefit needs to supplement national tendencies to seek advantage within the increasingly competitive environment surrounding the forest sector in the Asian Pacific region.
Research and institutions
An increasingly competitive environment for the forestry sector in the Asian Pacific region requires new knowledge, new technology, and new forms of organization and administration of forest resources and forest industry strategies. Research and education is critical to maintaining adequate institutional capacity to maintain and increase the performance of the forestry sector.
Much research on technical forestry has been conducted throughout the Asian Pacific Region, often with excellent cooperation and technical exchange. New forms of communication and information technologies facilitates access to knowledge, reducing the need for independent closed systems within each country. Means of cooperation and promotion of mutual interests will require greater focus on development of regional capacity and sharing of knowledge.
Institutional capacity increasingly incorporates new and different disciplines and fields that have not traditionally been seen as 'forestry'. To a great extent, today's issues and problems transcend technical forestry, involving economic, policy and social sciences. Linkages with other disciplines, and sectors, requires new and innovative approaches of research and administration. For example, population growth and economic development have not traditionally been seen as primary forestry matters. Silviculture, forest management, and growth-yield models have taken preference over population models, welfare economics, and public administration.
Critical re-thinking of the institutional framework for forestry sector development will increasingly require expanding the margins of forestry to integrate these 'external' elements. Forestry, and forest products, will increasingly become a business science in the Asian Pacific region. A strong scientific base for forestry and product technology will remain essential but must be supplemented by additional disciplinary dimensions to assure that sound structures are put in place to maximize the opportunities and competitiveness of the region.
Another dimension of national capacity in many countries of Asia Pacific includes significant issues surrounding the economic role of market structures in decision-making and the allocation of resources, including the role of market-like institutions for the production and distribution of forest products. This issue is discussed in more specific terms later in this section. However, the important role this factor plays in shaping the role of the forest products industry needs to be recognized as a major determinant of competitiveness and investments in operating efficiency.
Large scale forest industry & investment
Issues surround the proper role and scope of large scale industrial development and the sources and requirements for investment. Historically, forest industry was primarily domestically owned/controlled, often with government direct involvement. Technology was frequently simple and inexpensive. Development of modern industry capacity has frequently led to large economies of scale, with larger production capacity, larger raw material input requirements, and newer and more expensive technology. Not infrequently the capacity to develop modern industrial structures has led to foreign investment and the sharing of control and management. Concerns regarding 'foreign control' of forest resources, charges of reckless 'exploitation' without regard to environmental consequences or future conditions are also common.
Where the scale of production exceeds the needs of local markets, the role of marketing and distribution efficiencies also affect the scale of industry. Larger transactions and continuity in supplying international channels requires much more coordination in production and distribution, requiring capacities often beyond the small individual enterprises traditionally found in many parts of the developing countries.
Small scale forest industry
Traditional, small scale forest industries are seen as being 'closer to the people' and in many cases more responsive to local consumption needs. Local ownership and management and the participation of local residents in primary employment are seen as primary benefits of forest industry quite apart from the actual production of output and the consumption of products destined for markets elsewhere. The distributional and secondary impacts of industry, rather than the efficiency in operations within an international context, may well dominate industrial policies.
New technology is also often seen as 'inappropriate' for local applications where fears of displacing existing capacity can prevail. Further, the indirect consequences of large scale industry in terms of raw material requirements, extensive control over land and resources, and the potential for unintended environmental risks can all create the desire to retain small scale operations and enterprises in spite of possible adverse economics and inefficiencies. As noted above, issues surrounding ownership of industry, sources of capital investment, and the degree of foreign control all enter into considerations of appropriateness of industrial structure. From an Asia Pacific regional perspective, development of an internationally competitive forest products sector will certainly raise many issues regarding size and scale of enterprises.

Forest products marketing and trade
Timber certification
Product substitution
Internal market barriers
External market barriers
Demand for forest products
Forest products are the source of significant employment and income in the Asia Pacific Region (see Table 10). Where resources have been relatively abundant, local domestic consumption has frequently been quite low, at least for commercial forest products. Production at a level and scale consistent with resource capacity requires the marketing of products well beyond the local arena, and as illustrated in this review, often in widely diverse international markets. Participation is international markets is uniquely different than serving local needs and traditional end users. The requirements for knowledge and information on global market trends and requirements, pricing, arrangements for credit, product grades and quality, transportation and shipping, and a host of issues arise that can directly affect the economic viability of forest sector operations. As noted, the scale of operations must often expand due to marketing and distributional requirements separate from internal
manufacturing considerations. The proper role of government in the promotion and control of trade, by both importer and exporter countries, lead directly to many issues of competitiveness and open trade.
Consumer services and support are frequently cited as being as important or more so than strictly price competitiveness. Assurances of reliability in filling orders, quality control, shipment schedules, settlement of disputes and a host of other business related issues impact marketing and trade decisions. National and international relations at higher levels also shape trade in forest products. Development of regional trade blocs with preferential trade treatment among member countries can often offer advantages and efficiencies in marketing and trade, but can also provide the means for increased trade barriers.
Control of marketing and distribution also raises issues of potential monopoly or non-competitive business practices and/or allegations of subsidy or 'unfair' advantages. Frequent trade disputes between the USA and Canada, for example, revolve around the allocation and marketing of timber under Provincial control in Canada. Development of a substantial wood-based panel industry in Indonesia together with the phase-out of log exports was accompanied by many allegations of unfair competition and monopoly control and subsidies by government.
Timber certification
More recently, major issues surrounding certification of timber, primarily tropical timber, as a means of assuring environmentally sound and sustainable forest management have given rise to concerns of market control. Whether markets will respond favorably to certification, in terms of the willingness of consumers to pay premiums for 'certified timber' sufficient to differentiate markets is presently uncertain. Further, whether certification and the potential of closing markets to non-certified producers is either a necessary or sufficient incentive to change forest management is also unresolved. Fundamental disputes regarding what qualifies as 'certified' sustainable management, who determines certification, and labeling or tracking wood through complex layers of transactions and processing up to the consumer levels raise practical issues of implementation. The potential for distorting markets, and the adverse impact of added costs on market demand are also important issues
confronting wood producers in the Asia Pacific Region. The less transparent costs to consumers in terms of added price and the consequences in terms of user reactions remain largely conjectural. ITTO (1996) reported on on-going efforts to document various certification proposals and schemes, and indicated that some Asia Pacific producers, led by Indonesia, are considering their own certification programs. Further, ITTO cites World Bank findings that certification 'benefits' to tropical timber producers could potentially reach $577 million per year, primarily in the form of preventing loss of markets and recovering markets already 'lost' due to non-certification, but apparently does not include costs of certification programs nor added costs for sustainable management (ITTO 1996, p. 4).
Product substitution
A related marketing issue relates to the potential for substitution of other timber and non-wood based materials for traditional uses of Asia Pacific forest products in response to scarcity and price movements. Consumption decisions involving forest products include the consideration of other available products and price. A major determinant of demand is the price of a specific timber product relative to other products. Normal economic relationships captured in the concept of demand specify that as price of a good increases, consumers will choose less of that item. As the relative price increases, consumers will choose to switch to acceptable substitute products. This relationship is expressed as "own-price" elasticity and 'cross-price' elasticity, but both indicate the relative responsiveness of demand to price changes.
As was noted above in discussing price trends, Asia Pacific timber producers have experienced increasing real prices over time. There is also some indication that this region has seen price increases greater than price changes for other tropical producers, at least through the peak prices experienced in 1993. The short term demand for forest products is generally considered to be reasonably price 'inelastic', meaning that quantity consumed will change proportionately, by an amount less than an increase in price. For example, if price elasticity is -0.5, this implies that the quantity consumed would fall by 0.5 percent in response to a 1.0 percent increase in price. A value greater than 1.0 would be 'elastic', indicating that consumption quantity would change proportionately greater than price.
A summary of estimated price elasticities for various products and markets are shown in Table 47. In only a few selected cases do elasticities have a value (-) exceeding 1.0. Japan and Korean markets for plywood and sawnwood are the most price responsive.

Clearly, consumption is affected by price. In the short run, it is assumed that the price of all other goods and services are held constant, together with all other demand 'shifters' including the availability of alternative goods being constant. In the longer term, these conditions do not hold and relative prices and availability of substitutes can adjust, leading to 'higher' measures of elasticity and hence substitution. While longer term elasticities are frequently estimated as 'inelastic' (meaning the absolute value is less than 1.0), values are higher, often placed in the range of 0.6-0.8, simply meaning that proportionately larger changes in consumption are likely when higher real relative prices occur over time.
Higher prices also provide an incentive for development of alternative products by potential competitors. The development of wood composites, plastics, and other non-traditional products has taken place as evidenced by changes in the Japanese markets. Further, species substitution has occurred as supply conditions in various regions change. The potential for conifer-non conifer substitution is particularly significant for Asia Pacific producers as additional constraints are placed on roundwood production under sustainable management practices.
These effects would, of course, be captured in estimates of long term elasticities. Present econometric estimates are, however, quite variable and frequently subject to widely different assumptions and methods of estimation, leading to conflicting and variable estimates. Further, potential shifts in elasticities over time are not well understood, although existing studies indicate a general expectation that over time the long term elasticities have been increasing.
The understanding of real price trends, changes in real relative prices, and the competitive position of Asia Pacific producers in competition with other suppliers and sources of alternative products is incomplete. The dynamics of global markets will require a better basis for assessing competitiveness, including the role of price trends on both producers and consumers.
Internal market barriers
The role of government and markets for the allocation of resources within Asia Pacific countries is also at issue, where governments are the primary 'owner' and source of resources. Major decisions regarding the terms and conditions for access to resources, controls over the allocation for specific uses (including export), taxes and fees, royalties or other terms of payment for timber, and differential policies for alternative uses and marketing of products (export taxes, incentive domestic processing rebates on royalties), all influence decisions on the levels of production and the markets served. Likewise, trade barriers on imports for the purpose of protecting domestic industries and/or to discourage consumption also impact the structure of industry and the allocation of production to markets, both domestic and international.
The potential for under-pricing of timber through royalty or concession problems has been widely recognized as creating incentives and pressures for excessive harvesting, and ultimately excess capacity in harvesting and processing. Lower prices also act as a disincentive for investments in forest management.
External market barriers
The Asia Pacific region also confronts external market barriers in the form of import tariffs imposed on products, quotas and other non-tariff barriers, and the emerging trend towards certification and the possible imposition of bans on non-certified products. All of these barriers restrict access to potential markets and/or impose costs that place Asia Producers at a possible disadvantage. A summary of trade barriers facing tropical timber producers in ITTO Consumer countries was reported in Table 46. As indicated, important barriers remain, particularly for value-added or secondary manufactured products. As illustrated in Table 46, barriers exist for both countries within the Asia Pacific region as well as for countries external to the region.
Global movement towards more open and free trade would result in a continuing trend of reducing such barriers. Formation of regional trade blocs, however, could move towards a set of regional trade preferences to the disadvantage of external countries. Evolution of the EC trade policies, the North American Trade Agreement, and the possibility of new and expanded agreements to the exclusion of ASEAN is a continuing issue of importance to the Asia Pacific Region. In spite of major initiatives to reduce trade barriers, the outlook is not entirely encouraging. A 'subjective assessment' by Bourke (1992) as to the status of trade barriers during three time periods starting with the 1960's is reproduced as Table 48. While it is felt that tariff barriers have declined throughout the time period covered, other barriers are judged as either static or increasing. Perhaps more importantly, estimates are that both price controls and levies as well as outright quotas or prohibitions
placed on exports have continuously increased since the 1960's.

Demand for forest products
Global aggregate demand for forest products continues to grow in response to growing population and developing economies increasing the ability of many countries to increase the consumption levels. Uses of timber for construction and other end uses differ by region and culture and in large part is shaped by historical availability and price of timber. Yet as these underlying determinants to demand change, individual countries and regions will experience varying patterns of shifting demand. As noted above, the relative responses to these changes with respect to prices (elasticities) will significantly affect the ultimate patterns of distribution of forest products and consumption.
Changes in the global tastes and preferences for wood (largely a cultural factor) can also be expected in major markets. While this is partly induced by changing price structures, more fundamental physiological factors influencing perceptions of wood will be reflected in demand. Issues of wood "quality", renewability, and environmental impacts will influence consumers and hence demand. Renewability of forests can be a positive influence on consumers increasingly interested in sustainability of all natural resources and conservation. On the other hand, destructive exploitation of forests is easily translated into images of damaged environments and irreversible loss of long term capacity - a factor working against consumer preferences for wood products.
A major influence on demand within the Asia Pacific Region relates to the non-industrial demands on forests, particularly for fuelwood. Within this region, total apparent consumption of roundwood increased from 917.9 million cubic meters in 1980 to over 1,164.8 million cubic meters for 1994 or about 27 percent. By far the largest share of this increase was for non-industrial consumption of non-conifer species which reached 749.2 million cubic meters in 1994, equaling 81.5 percent of all non-conifer consumption and over 64.3 percent of all roundwood consumption. Demand for energy for both commercial and household purposes will undoubtedly increase with population and economic development, and the limitations on alternative energy sources will continue to place heavy pressure on forests.

Social and economic trends and the environment
Environmental functions of forests
Rural energy development
Enhancement of research
Centrally planned systems for forestry
Market based systems for forestry
Another major group of issues confronting forestry in the Asia Pacific Region relate to conditions of social and economic trends and related concerns regarding the broader human and physical environment. Among the leading concerns is the continuing growth in population which threatens to cancel gains in economic outputs and growth in the per-capita incomes and standard of living for many of the Region's population. Opportunities for economic development, including broader access to participation in the global economy, together with rapidly increasing concerns for the macro environment will change the nature of the role of forests in the development process. Many of the causes and possible solutions will rest outside the forestry sector as traditionally viewed, requiring integration and cooperation between sectors. Those responsible for economic development planning, population, rural settlement, the environment, agriculture, energy, water resources and forestry must all be
part of the teamwork addressing these issues. Partial approaches and limitations on what is considered 'forestry' are likely to continue to lead to continued failures where linkages to other sectors are not fully incorporated into policies and programs.
Environmental functions of forests
It is clear that forests are increasingly of interest and concern for the non-timber functions in potential conflict with the more utilitarian commodity outputs. These growing concerns are both internal, representing the interests of governments and residents of individual countries as well as the broader international community. Biodiversity, sustainability of the productive capacity of forests, air and water quality, amenity values, wildlife conservation, and global warming and carbon cycles all impinge on traditional approaches to forestry and indirectly to the levels of utilization.
Major issues of equity between the developed countries with diminishing resources and the protection of the environment (particularly tropical and sub-tropical) in developing regions including Asia Pacific place region against region and country against country. The legitimate interests of the developing countries within the Asia Pacific region for greater material and economic well-being often depend upon limited options, including greater use of forests as the instrument of development. In contrast, these forests are seen by others outside the region as one of the last remaining reservoirs of biota capable of sustaining the global environment. Transfer payments and other forms of compensation for deferred use of resources for broad global benefit to offset local and regional options forgone will be central to incentives and viable options for conservation throughout much of the Asia Pacific region.
Rural energy development
As noted, one of the most pervasive demands on the forest of the Asia Pacific Region is for domestic energy. Throughout much of the Region the options for energy development are extremely limited. Fossil fuels are scarce and import costs are beyond the reach of most of the population. While increased efficiency in wood-based energy is possible, this alone will not materially reduce demand for fuelwood. Deforestation and degradation of otherwise productive forests throughout the region will continue until viable solutions are found. Greater recognition that many of the fundamental problems and issues are not entirely, or perhaps even largely, centered on the commercial and industrial component of forestry, nor on the role of consumption and trade of roundwood and primary forest products is needed to redirect policy formulation and sector strategies towards other pressing causes contributing to the present forestry sector condition. Energy demand and alternatives will of
necessity be central to this shift in focus.
Enhancement of research
It has been noted that future sector development will require greater understanding of many aspects of forestry beyond the traditional boundaries of the sector. Technical information and science regarding the forest itself will of course remain central to better management and utilization of forests, the utilization of products, and the conditions and limits of sustainability of the forest as a complex natural system. However, the forest does not exist separate from the larger social and economic realities surrounding the sector as uniquely experienced in each country of the Asia Pacific Region. The economic, social, legal and policy framework existent at any given time fundamentally determines how and on what conditions forest use will occur and the likely outcomes imposed on the physical and biological systems. Planting the best genetically improved seedling in the face of ineffective land tenure arrangements, pressures for subsistence agriculture, uncontrolled grazing,
undervalued markets, and ineffective management and administration will be certain of failure. Research and analysis of the surrounding framework for the forestry sector in terms of the component influences much seriously support the more technical and scientific research capacity of the region.
Research of both scientific and social-political issues must also be effectively brought to bear on formulation of viable solutions. Much information and analysis exists but is not fully utilized. The implications of the shift from exploitation of natural forest stocks to an era of investment in forest production and competition for both land and resources in an internationally competitive environment should not be underestimated in the context of traditional policies and institutions controlling the forest sector. As adequate as past practices and approaches may have been, the reality of today's conditions and the emerging dimensions of the future will require substantial rethinking based on new knowledge and understandings.
Centrally planned systems for forestry
Forestry throughout the Asia Pacific Region, and indeed much of the world, is under central government authority and largely administered under central planning approaches. Whether the issue is the ownership of land and forests, the determination of forest use, the setting of allowable levels of production and harvest, the structure of forest industry, the allocation of products to markets and trade, and many aspects of consumption are regulated and guided by the hand of government. Various political and economic considerations play into the rationale and reasons for this approach. Even in the developed countries of the region, central planning and government intervention in forestry and sector policy is much more common than in other major economic sectors. Almost every country (New Zealand has become an exception) has a large and pervasive government professional bureaucracy for almost all major aspects of the forestry sector.
The structure and adequacy of the established bureaucratic approaches for forestry are increasingly questioned relative to the efficiency and effectiveness of results and the ability to respond to changing conditions. While it is unlikely that major changes in land ownership and control will be forthcoming in most countries, the emphasis on the potential for modifying central controls and administration is growing. Innovative changes are being tried, and mixed economic systems are being developed to supplement central authority.
Policy changes related to 'markets' for all factors of production (including labor, land, capital, and material inputs) are increasingly seen as sources of information regarding relative resource scarcity and management is being recognized as investment activity linked to producing desirable outcomes (commodity or otherwise) in a socially efficient manner. Accountability for results is increasing at all levels of forestry, from forest and plantation through forest enterprises and marketing. The need for responsive administrative structures, and the prerequisite information flows and data at all levels is huge. Even under conditions of publicly administered programs and activities, the fundamental basis for decision-making requires new structures and new and different kinds of information for setting goals, strategic planning, and allocation decisions.
Market based systems for forestry
The Asia Pacific Region includes a wide variety of economic systems, from relatively open market systems to administered economies. From the "shock treatment" of New Zealand's decisions to privatize almost all aspects of forestry to China's "Market System with Socialist Characteristic's", the Region is experimenting with the possibilities of greater market-based structures. Lessons are being learned and shared as this process moves forward.^9 No single 'model' is likely to emerge, although it is widely recognized that greater reliance on individual initiative and incentives can potentially increase the performance of the forestry sector in contrast to command and control processes. Mobilization of individuals, cooperation and participation in conservation and protection of resources, and efficiencies in utilization of investment resources based on sound incentives is seen as a viable alternative to regulation and prohibitions adversely cooperation and efficiency.
^9 The FAO, with funding from Japan, initiated a new Regional Project in 1995 on Market Reforms in the Forestry Sector involving China, Mongolia, Viet Nam, Myanmar and Laos. This project seeks to build upon the accumulated experience of each country under the prevailing unique conditions with the goal of possible adoption of new approaches as appropriate in other situations throughout the participating countries.
Forestry has, over many years, experimented with variable forest management schemers such as community forestry, agro-forestry, social forestry and related concepts in recognition of the need for greater participation by local populations in matters affecting their well-being, either as consumers of forest products (including non-wood forest products), protection of resources (watersheds, wildlife) and to reduce potentially degrading land use practices for short term gain. In many cases, these approaches have at best represented mixtures of decentralized responsibility and decision-making with central control. Results have been mixed, but numerous successful examples exist to encourage further development and experimentation with capturing the huge benefits of personal initiative and responsibility coupled with benefit-sharing and long term potential for gain to replace short term exploitation of resources.

Disaggregated spatial equilibrium analysis
The review conducted in this study, together with the numerous citations and emphasis in the literature, confirm the utility of spatial equilibrium methodologies to adequately capture the complexity of factors and interactions driving the overall forestry sector - including that of the Asia Pacific Region. Models are abstractions, and necessarily limited in terms of detail, but when properly structured (and used) can afford insights much more comprehensively than discrete and partial analysis of component topics or issues.
Two major spatial equilibrium models were utilized in the recently completed studies undertaken by ITTO and the World Bank covering large portions of the Asia Pacific Region as defined here. It is Recommended that the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission include the further development and specification of an appropriate spatial equilibrium analysis into the proposed Forest Sector Outlook Study. Collaboration or synthesis of the strengths of existing models, or modification of an existing model if feasible, to more fully capture the diverse aspects of the Asia Pacific Region should be pursued in lieu of a new model development. Advantages and disadvantages of the existing models that have been applied to the Region should be explored by a select team of analysts as a precursor to selecting a specific approach. Refinement of the model approach to adequately incorporate country level analysis, utilization of an improved database, the reflection of non-wood forest products and
fuelwood, and improved measures of elasticity's as envisioned in other recommendations should be factors included in the assessment of model alternatives.
It is further Recommended that the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, through an appropriate Technical Committee, define a reasonable range of scenarios for analysis bracketing the likely range of the parameters of the model as based on preliminary findings of other components or modules of the Outlook Study.
Ideally, a modified model should be available for experimentation and further ongoing analysis of the Asia Pacific Region. However, the necessity of technical expertise, continual database updating, and other operational considerations will likely limit the practical development of a "desktop" model that can be easily applied. It is therefore Recommended that the feasibility of a jointly supported ongoing capability be established under proper authority for the ongoing analysis of new trends and information, incorporation of updated country databases, and the exploration of alternative scenarios. Such a capability can perhaps be accomplished by contract rather than establishment of a separate or new analytical unit.

FAO - Forestry assessment
Outlook projections for the Asia Pacific Region were compiled from three primary sources:
1) Forestry Statistics Today for Tomorrow: 19945-1993 & 2010 (FAO, Rome, 1995)
2) Forest Products: World Outlook Projections: Projections of Consumption and Production of Wood-based Products to 2010, FAO Forestry Paper 84, Vol. II, (FAO, Rome, updated September 1991)
3) Forest Resources Assessment 1990 (FAO, Rome)
Basic data on total roundwood for 1993 by Asia Pacific Region is summarized in Table 49 as a point of reference. Detailed information by sub-region and country is contained in Appendix 25. Information regarding the recent trends (1980, 1985 and 1990-94) is also summarized in Table 50, with the trends in apparent consumption highlighted.^10 As previously noted, total roundwood production for Asia Pacific increased from 891.3 million cubic meters in 1980 to 1,131.8 million cubic meters in 1994. With the Region being a net importer of roundwood, total consumption has grown from 917.9 million cubic meters to 1,164.5 million cubic meters in 1994. As shown in Table 49, the majority of roundwood production is non-conifer, at 919.6 million cubic meters for 1993 with some 208.2 million cubic meters of conifer. Charcoal accounted for an additional 22 million cubic meters. The Asia Pacific Region accounted for almost $34.5 percent of global total roundwood, and 44.7 percent of
non-conifer roundwood. In contrast, the Region produced only 18.5 percent of conifer roundwood.
^10 Table 48 reproduces the information shown in Table 33 with the emphasis put on the trends in the regional apparent consumption determined as production (+/-) net trade.
Table 49 also indicates the dominance of fuelwood for the Asia Pacific Region, for 1993, total fuelwood production and consumption was an estimated 855.8 million cubic meters, or 74.4 percent of reported total roundwood. This represented 45.6 percent of global fuelwood for 1993. Projections by FAO indicate expected consumption of over 1,030.1 million cubic meters of fuelwood by the year 2010, an increase of 20.4 percent over 1993. Projected volume increase is over 174.3 million cubic meters.

Basic summary comparisons for 1993 and projected consumption for 2010 is shown in Table 51 for Industrial Roundwood, Sawnwood and Wood Based Panels. Detailed data and projections by sub-region and country is included in Appendix 26. Industrial roundwood consumption is projected to increase from 329 million cubic meters in 1993 to some 563 thousand cubic meters in 2010. This represents an increase of 233.7 million cubic meters, or 70.9 percent over 1993. Thus although fuelwood is expected to maintain a large share of projected consumption, the growth in industrial roundwood consumption exceeds fuelwood increase by volume. The Asia Pacific Region would gain slightly in terms of worldwide consumption to about 24.7 percent of projected global consumption in 2010.
The Asia Pacific Region is projected to increase consumption of sawnwood from 111.5 million cubic meters in 1993 to over 200.3 million cubic meters for 2010. This represents an increase of over 88.8 million cubic meters (79.7 percent). Consumption within the Asia Pacific Region would grow to about 31.9 percent of global consumption from just under 26 percent in 1993. Finally, consumption of wood based panels is projected at 99.3 million cubic meters in 2010, in contrast to 41.4 million cubic meters for 1993. This is an increase of 57.9 million cubic meters, or over 140 percent.
Essentially all sub-regions are expected to experience increased consumption of fuelwood, with the largest increase in South Asia. India accounts for the majority of the sub-region's increase, at over 388.2 million cubic meters of fuelwood consumption in 2010, an increase of over 75 million cubic meters. Industrial Roundwood consumption is projected to increase in all sub-regions as well, with the biggest gains in North Asia (99.5 million cubic meters) led by China (+89 million cubic meters) with a more moderate gain in Japan's consumption (+12.3 million cubic meters). Insular SE Asia is projected to consume 159.8 million cubic meters of industrial roundwood in 2010, a doubling of 1993 consumption. The largest increases are in Malaysia (42.4 million cubic meters) and Indonesia (35.1 million cubic meters). Philippine consumption would also double, to 8.1 million cubic meters.
Significant changes in sawnwood consumption is projected for all sub-regions excepting Oceania-S. Pacific. Greatest absolute increases in sawnwood consumption are projected for North Asia (33.2 million cubic meters) and South Asia (25.4 million cubic meters). China, Japan and South Korea account for the majority of North Asia's projected increase in sawnwood consumption, while India dominates South Asia consumption increases.
Wood panel consumption increased significantly in all sub-regions under the FAO projections, with North Asia again showing the greatest gain (48.1 million cubic meters). While China's projected consumption of wood panels doubles, Japan consumption leads North Asia with a projected increase in consumption of 290 percent, to over 38.2 million cubic meters.

Projected consumption for Pulp for Paper and Paper & Paperboard is summarized in Table 52. Detailed estimates by sub-region and country are provided in Appendix 27. As shown, wood pulp production for 1993 was almost 15.8 million metric tons, with 1.7 million metric tons from other fibers.^11 Including separate estimates for China, total wood pulp production would be an estimated 18.2 million metric tons and production from other fibers would be 17.1 million cubic meters. Asia Pacific projected consumption of total pulp for paper for 2010, exclusive of China, was estimated at 38.9 million metric tons, or an increase of almost 16 million metric tons. China's expected large increase in pulp consumption would be in addition to this incomplete projection. Projections from FAO Forestry Report 84 show China's consumption in 2010 at 20.8 million tons of other fiber pulp and 8.9 million metric tons of wood pulp, for a total of 29.7 million metric tons, raising the approximate
estimated total Asia Pacific Region consumption to over 68.6 million metric tons.
^11 Information for China is not included in these projections, hence totals for North Asia are incomplete. China produces a significant volume of wood pulp, estimated at 2.4 million metric tons for 1993. Pulp from other fibers was estimated at 15.3 million metric tons for China in 1993. FAO Forest Products Yearbook-1993.
Paper and Paperboard consumption as shown in Table 52 is estimated to grow from 74.1 million metric tons for 1993 in the Asia Pacific Region to almost 182.7 million metric tons with over 153.4 million metric tons consumed in North Asia. Overall, this is an increase of 108.6 million metric tons, or almost 147 percent over 1993. For North Asia, consumption would increase by 92.7 million metric tons, or by over 152 percent. Consumption in other sub-regions are also projected to increase significantly in percentage terms, although the absolute increases are more moderate. South Asia would increase by almost 4 million metric tons (113 percent), Continental SE Asia by 2.7 million metric tons (137 percent), Insular SE Asia by 6.6 million metric tons (143 percent) and Oceania S.-Pacific by 2.7 million metric tons (83 percent). Overall, Asia Pacific is projected to increase the share of global paper and paperboard consumption from 29.4 percent to over 38.1 percent by 2010.
Outlook projections were updated by FAO in September 1991^12 Projections for the years 2000 and 2010 are summarized in Table 53 with detailed sub-region and country projections included in Appendix 28. The projected consumption for fuelwood is slightly lower, at 1.02 billion cubic meters, or about 10 thousand cubic meters below the 1990 Assessment projected level. Industrial Roundwood consumption for Asia Pacific in 2010 is projected at a higher level, however, at 632.7 million cubic meters in contrast to an earlier projection of 563 million cubic meters. Wood for pulp was projected at an additional 138.6 million cubic meters, while sawnwood in 2010 was slightly lower (at 194 million cubic meters) than earlier projections of 200.3 million cubic meters. Wood based panels were increased slightly in the revised projections, from 99.3 million cubic meters to 100.5 million cubic meters, resulted in increased consumption for South Asia, Continental SE Asia and North Asia, whereas
projected consumption was lower for Insular SE Asia and Oceania-S. Pacific.

FAO, Forest Products: World Outlook Projections. Forestry Paper 84, 1991
Projections formulated by FAO utilize the statistical relationship between consumption and measures of the individual country economies, including the projected growth rates for gross domestic product, gross fixed capital formation, levels of construction and projected growth, private final consumption, total population changes in forest area, shares of wood in energy consumption. Multiple regression techniques were used to formulate projection equations based on combinations of these determinants. Separate supply and demand functions were not formulated or utilized in these projections.

World Bank - Tropical deforestation in Asia
An analysis prepared by Jaakko Poyry for the World Bank (1992) "Tropical Deforestation in Asia and the Market for Wood" provided a detailed analysis of timber markets and the relationship of timber prices and sustainable management incentives. Supply regions included Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, with major market focus on Japan, Korea, the USA, the UK, Germany and Italy. As part of this analysis, Jaakko Poyry and CINTRAFOR, University of Washington jointly provided a global equilibrium analysis based on the use of the CINTRAFOR Global Trade Model (CGTM). That analysis was contained in Annex IX to the Main Report, and was titled "International Trade in Tropical Hardwoods: The Impact of Supply Reductions, Substitution, Trade Liberalization, and Carbon Emission Policy" (Perez-Garcia and Lippke, 1992).
Alternate scenarios were developed for this study, including a "baseline" projection. For the three supplier countries, it was estimated that total harvest of tropical timber exceeded 80 million cubic meters annually, which was 2 percent of the commercial growing stock. Further, it was reported that this harvest level, utilizing the stock of natural forest stands, was some 70 percent above the current annual growth, thus reducing total inventory. This study also highlighted the trends in forest land conversions, with a decline of an estimated 1.6 million ha. annually for the three countries. Declining forest inventory, together with forest conversion was estimated to result in a decline in log supply by 15-20 percent within ten years.
Overall, a decline in harvest of some 40 percent was envisioned as required to reach sustainability. Price increases of 35-40 percent per decade were foreseen for logs and increased prices of manufactured products of 20-50 percent per decade were forecast.
Projected Base Case tropical harvests through the year 2000 (including West Africa and Brazil) are shown in Table 54 and shown in Figure 33 for the three Asia-Pacific producers (including both East Malaysia and West Malaysia). The related baseline projections for "most likely" log prices for Malaysia and Indonesia as well as the estimated "global average" price through the year 2000 are shown in Figure 34. The 'moderate' increases projected for Asian prices is due to predicted substitution of other materials, primarily softwoods and temperate hardwoods, primarily in construction grades of wood-panels and reconstituted wood products. To a lesser extent, environmental pressures on tropical timbers, primarily in the European markets, also is projected to lead to substitution.
Base case projections for hardwood (non-conifer) logs in Asia are summarized in Figure 35, illustrating imports by Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan-Hong Kong, hardwood log consumption in these four importer markets, and log exports by East Malaysia in comparison to the world total. Japan's imports are projected to continue to decline to 2000, while Taiwan-Hong Kong imports increase for 1990-2000, with a slight downturn at the end of the decade. South Korea and China would import slightly falling amounts. Hardwood log consumption would fall in Japan, largely consistent with the drop in imports, while consumption in China would increase on the basis of increased harvest.
Log exports, derived from East Malaysia, are projected to decline from approximately 20 million cubic meters in 1990-91 to under 15 million cubic meters in 2000.

Projected trends for Hardwood Plywood and Hardwood Sawnwood production are shown in Figure 36. Hardwood plywood production would continue to be centered in Indonesia, increasing by about 1.5 million cubic meters between 1990 and 2000. Production in Japan would decline, to under 5 million cubic meters by the end of the decade. Production in South Korea would continue to fall to less than 500 thousand cubic meters, while Taiwan-Hong Kong production would increase moderately to just over 1 million cubic meters. Non-conifer sawnwood trends would see a moderately rising production in Indonesia to approximately 9 million cubic meters, while West Malaysia production drops sharply, from about 6 million cubic meters to less than 4 million cubic meters. East Malaysia production sawnwood production is projected under the base case to increase from less than 2 million to over four million cubic meters.
The projections summarized here, as the Base Case scenario, fail to show the ultimate implications of this outlook, which is projected to be a near-depletion of commercial timber in Malaysia by the year 2010. As noted above, sustainability is estimated to require an approximate 40 percent reduction from the total harvest levels for Indonesian, Malaysia, and the Philippines (a reduction of some 32 million cubic meters) to approximately 48 million cubic meters without substantial improvements in forest management. Alternative management intensities are estimated to potentially yield sustainable harvests of up to 58-78 million cubic meters but are considered unrealistic at present due to investment and policy constraints.
A second scenario examined in the World Bank study included a 'sustainable management' option whereby current harvest levels would be reduced in order to conserve growing stock to buffer a projected decline in commercial timber after the year 2000. This would also offset the projected decline of harvest below sustainable levels after the turn of the century which would otherwise be necessary to allow growing stocks to recover to a level consistent with the reduced long term sustainable harvest, primarily in East Malaysia. Simulations of this option are summarized in Figure 37 illustrating sustainable log production, log trade and price projections through the year 2000. These charts contrast the sustainable harvest scenario with the base case described above. In each case the darkened symbols represent the base case outlook while the unshaped symbols illustrate the sustainable harvest scenario.
Projected harvest for East and West Malaysia and for Indonesia are shown in the top frame of Figure 37. In each instance, the sustainable harvest scenario would see a reduction in harvest levels compared to the base case outlook. Reductions in Indonesia harvest would result in an output of approximately 25 million cubic meters for 2000, considerably below the approximate 38 million cubic meter output under the base case. The projected gain under the base case is lost, together with an absolute decline after 1990.
West Malaysia output would fall under this scenario to about 4.7 million cubic meters, in comparison to the base case harvest of approximately 9 million cubic meters. East Malaysia would see a decline under the sustainable harvest scenario to about 12.5 million cubic meters, a decline from the base case output of about 23 million cubic meters. However, East Malaysia would harvest more after the year 2000 in this case than under the base case due to the sustainability constraint, thereby avoiding the more drastic decline in commercial inventory.

Under the sustainable harvest scenario, log import trade for major Asia Pacific log consumers would show a decline relative to the base case, primarily Japan and South Korea. The main impact on trade would be the decline in log exports from East Malaysia, mirroring the projected decline in harvests towards a sustainable level after the year 2000. Projected exports for E. Malaysia would drop from about 21 million cubic meters (1990) to under 10 million cubic meters by 2000.
As shown in the lower frame of Figure 37, hardwood log prices for Asia Pacific Importers would increase in response to the volume declines. Upward pressures approximating US$ 100/cum by the year 200 are projected for Taiwan-Hong Kong and South Korea, with a higher price differential being maintained between these two importers of less than US$ 50/cum. Price would increase relatively more for Japan as premium quality logs decline in availability. Projected price by 200 would be approximately US$ 125/cum above the base case, reaching prices approaching US$ 500/cum.
The potential for possible increased substitution of softwood in plywood panels was also simulated, as summarized in Figure 38. Substitution would dampen pressure on hardwood demand and prices, resulting in declines in hardwood plywood consumption in major Asia Pacific markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan-Hong Kong.

ITTO - Economic Linkages
The ITTO completed a study, prepared by the London Environmental Economics Center, titled "The Economic Linkages between the International Trade in Tropical Timber and the Sustainable Management of Tropical Forests" (ITTO, 1993). This study was supported by eleven technical annex reports, including an analysis by Perez-Garcia and Lippke "Measuring the Impacts of Tropical Timber Supply Constraints, Tropical Timber Trade Constraints and Global Trade Liberalization".
This study finds that the linkage between tropical timber trade and deforestation is not a major source of deforestation, given that a modest and declining proportion of tropical timber is industrial roundwood and that a declining proportion of that actually enters trade. As reported, 17 percent of non-conifer roundwood is used as industrial roundwood, with less than one-third of this entering trade. Thus, it was stated that only 6 percent of the total tropical non-conifer roundwood actually enters international trade channels. The study examines current linkages with forest exploitation and opening of forests for entry for agricultural encroachment and deforestation. It further considers the role of international trade as an economic incentive for sustainable management, and trade policy distortions
The annex materials for the ITTO analysis include the use of the CINTRAFOR Global Trade Model (CGTM) to develop a base case analysis to the year 2000. This base case is very close to that included in the World Bank review of tropical deforestation discussed above.
Timber harvest projections under the base case outlook for 2000 were adjusted downward slightly for Asian producers from the earlier base case presented in the World Bank outlook:
Projected Harvest, 2000 (million cum)
ITTO
WB
Malaysia East
Malaysia West
Indonesia
Philippines
Papua New Guinea
Indochina
Total
Projected harvest was 77.8 million cubic meters, 3.3 million cubic meters below earlier estimates. The major adjustment was for Indonesia where estimated harvest was reduced by 2 million cubic meters. East Malaysia harvest estimate was also reduced, by 0.7 million cubic meters, to 22 million cubic meters for the year 2000.
Projections for hardwood sawlog exports, imports and consumption closely follow the projections shown in Figure 33, Figure 34, and Figure 35 above. Log price projections were revised upward, however. Figure 39 shows Indonesia prices rising to over US$ 110/cum, well above the level shown in Figure 34.^13 West Malaysia log price is forecast at near US$ 240/cum whereas the earlier estimate was about US$ 130/cum. East Malaysia projected price is projected at about US$ 140/cum, compared to just over US$ 100 in the World Bank forecasts.
^13 Perez Garcia-Lippke (1993) data discrepancies for Indonesia Hardwood Sawlog Production at 1990, which affects price projections. Adjusted projections were made to exclude this effect. Projected Indonesia price on the adjusted basis rises to about US$ 85 for the year 2000.
Projected production of hardwood plywood has also been revised from earlier estimates for the World Bank and are shown in Figure 40. In comparison to Figure 36, projected plywood output in Indonesia has been adjusted to an output of only about 9 million cubic meters for the year 2000, eliminating much of the projected increase shown in Figure 36. Japan production, however, is predicted at a steady to slightly higher level, reaching about 7 million cubic meters whereas earlier projections anticipated a decline to 5 million cubic meters. Projections for South Korean production of hardwood plywood are essentially the same, with production declining to less than 0.5 million cubic meters by 2000.
Projected production of hardwood sawnwood have likewise been revised as shown in Figure 41 (compare with Figure 36). Indonesian projected hardwood sawnwood rises to almost 14 million cubic meters, up from the earlier estimate of about 9 million cubic meters. East Malaysia production has also been revised upward, shown as growing from about 2 million cubic meters in 1990 to about 4 million cubic meters for 2000, slightly higher than earlier projections. West Malaysia projected hardwood sawnwood is consistent with earlier estimates, declining from about 6 million cubic meters to less than 4 million cubic meters by 2000.
The ITTO assessment concludes that the primary timber shortage is for tropical timber in contrast to conifer timber or temperate hardwoods. The declining harvest for the three major Asia Pacific producers of tropical hardwoods (Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines) with insufficient supplies in other tropical countries to offset this decline. Some shift in exports from Europe to Asian importers is anticipated, with increasing substitution of temperate hardwoods in the USA, Europe and other non-Asian consumer countries.
Growing domestic demand in producer countries of Asia Pacific for tropical timbers is also seen as reducing exports, with a declining demand in Japan particularly. Most critical constraints are projected for East Malaysia, where harvest reductions stimulate strong price increases.

The analysis concludes that higher prices can also help sustain investments in sustainable management, in part thereby offsetting a portion of the projected Regional declines in harvest and production of plywood and sawnwood. A sustainable management scenario was presented that closely follows that described above for the World Bank Analysis. Scenarios for timber supply reductions (either to moderate sustainable harvest declines for forest set-asides for conservation) and for log export restrictions were also completed and fully reported by Perez-Garcia and Lippke (1993). Reductions in supply for Malaysia (both East and West), Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea were simulated. Reduced supplies limit both exports and production, and increase regional prices for both timber and for consumers/importers Average incremental price increases for swallows of about $US 30 were projected for 2000 under this scenario. Production declines were greatest for East Malaysia
where harvest reductions without sustainable management were the greatest. Simulations of tropical import bans and/or import tariffs were made assuming a 10 percent increase in product prices at the destination importing countries. Production and exports decline in the face of lower producer prices as part of the impact of higher tariff costs is passed back to exporters.
Finally, the ITTO analysis examined a scenario of global trade liberalization for forest products. The impacts reverse those for trade barriers. Lower barriers or tariffs stimulate harvest and production through higher producer prices in the short run. Transfer costs for logs and products are assumed to be lowered by 10 percent for the scenario. Indonesia and Malaysia are projected as increasing harvest in the short run due to higher prices, with Indonesia harvest increasing by about 5 million cubic meters annually until 2000 and then declines to just below the base case harvest level due to reduced inventory. East Malaysia harvest also is projected to increase by 5 million cubic meters annually, speeding the depletion of existing inventory. After 1996, the projected harvest would necessarily fall below base case projections (which are declining) due to lack of inventory. Both East Malaysia and Indonesia would increase log exports in this case, with Indonesia exports
declining later in response to higher prices for sawnwood exports. Log prices would be higher to timber producers, by about 20 percent, which is seen as an incentive to accelerate sustainable management.

ITTO - Analysis of macroeconomic trends
The International Tropical Timber Organization also completed another major review analysis in 1995, prepared by Reid, Collins Consultants. This report, "Analysis of Macroeconomic Trends in the Supply and Demand of Sustainably Produced Tropical Timber from the Asia Pacific Region" was completed in two phases. The initial first phase was expanded and revised, adding new country information for Myanmar, Solomon Islands and Indochina to the initial coverage of producer and consumer countries. Additional supply information for Rubberwood, Coconut, and plantations was included with additional detail for several countries. The initial phase of the review developed three different analytical models:
1) Log Supply Model
2) Asia Pacific Tropical Timber Gap Model
3) Asia Pacific Tropical Timber Trade Model
Following extended review and comment, these models were updated and modified. The log supply model was developed to capture the implications of land use changes in the forest base and the consequences of alternative forest management and silvicultural options. The timber 'gap' model was utilized to estimate the likely difference between unconstrained demand and the projected supplies of tropical timber in the Asia Pacific region. Finally, the Tropical Trade Model was utilized to estimate equilibrium conditions considering supply, demand and price for each region and product as well as for the Asia Pacific region as defined for that study. It was intended that the models developed could be utilized by ITTO member countries to evaluate and test their own forest situation within the broader context of the Asia Pacific region. Limited scenarios were developed and evaluated to demonstrate the use of the models.
The base case analysis was designed to illustrate the implications of continued current forest management, means of timber utilization and manufacturing practices. A trade model scenario was developed to illustrate increased wood supplies, while a second scenario illustrated both increased supplies together with substitution of alternative materials in final products. A third scenario assumed no log exports after the year 2000
The updated results of the Tropical Timber Gap Model are reproduced in Figure 42. When timber supply is projected independent of timber demand (implicitly ignoring price effects on both) the regional timber supply falls from an estimated 95.5 million cubic meters in 1989 to 72 million cubic meters for 1990 and an upturn to 75.4 million cubic meters by 2010. At the same time, domestic consumption within the countries of the region (expressed in roundwood equivalents) increases from 67.2 million cubic meters (1989) to 97.3 million cubic meters in 2000. Thereafter, unconstrained domestic consumption increases to 136.2 million cubic meters in 2010. The potential "timber gap" for the region would be approximately 60.8 million cubic meters by 2010. The report stresses that this 'gap' will not in fact materialize due to market forces, but rather represents the order of magnitude of adjustment confronting the Asia Pacific Region. Price adjustments, and the induced responses from
consumers and producers (including those outside the region) must be sufficient to result in an equilibrium recognizing the added consequences of external regional net trade.
The Asia Pacific Tropical Timber Trade Model was utilized to estimate supply and demand relationships. Log supply was derived from the Log Supply Model with updated information regarding potential incremental supply from improved utilization practices, use of non-conventional harvesting (including helicopters) and the importation and processing of conifer timbers within the defined Asia Pacific region. Demand was modeled using 1991 price and quantities by country for plywood/veneer and sawnwood, with estimated own-price and end-use elasticities. Annual population growth adjusted by five year increments was related to consumption. Relative manufacturing cost and productivity (recovery rates) by country determined comparative advantage with respect to output of plywood/veneer and sawnwood. Transportation costs for plywood/veneer and logs from source to destination linked the countries of the region for balancing of trade. Import and/or export taxes were considered as
incremental costs. Exchange rates were used based on 1991-93 to adjust for currency differences.
Figure 42. Future Timber Requirements and Supply in the Asia-Pacific Region
Source: ITTO. 1995. Analysis of macroeconomic trends in the supply and demand of sustainably produced tropical timber from the Asia-Pacific Region.
The base case analysis was judged to be unrealistic since the conditions imposed on the analysis did not allow for wood substitution, resulting in reduced demand. Constraints on supply resulted in significant increased prices in producer countries, resulting in rapid increases in product prices.
Scenario One included the potential for supplemental timber supply in terms of saw and veneer logs available to the region. Table 55 below shows the estimated sources and volumes of such incremental supplies by 2010, indicating that both improved utilization and harvesting technology become feasible only at higher prices. Log supply estimates, including the substitution of softwoods, under this scenario are shown in Table 56. Through the effects of supplemental supply and softwood substitution, and the dampening effect on prices, demand (consumption) estimates increase over the base case projections as summarized in Table 57. Total plywood consumption would grow from 20.1 million cubic meters in 1991 to 20.8 million cubic meters in 2000 and to 22.2 million cubic metes for 2010. Sawnwood consumption would decline from 1991-2000, to 25.5 million cubic meters, then increase to 35.4 million cubic meters by 2010. Domestic production of plywood and sawnwood within the ITTO
producer and consumer countries is summarized in Table 58. For producer countries, plywood production would remain essentially non-conifer based, with production growing only moderately, to 8.9 million cubic meters for 2010, an increase from the estimated production of 8.3 million cubic meters in 1991. Sawnwood production would increase by almost one-half, from 22.9 million cubic meters (1991) to over 33.8 million cubic meters (2010) for the producer countries.
Within the ITTO consumer countries, however, changes in manufacturing would be more significant, with a decline in non-conifer production (due to the declining log supply) with a significant increase in the use of conifer timber. For plywood, tropical non-conifer production is projected to decline, from 11.7 million cubic meters (1991) to just under 6.1 million cubic meters by 2010. At the same time, growth in consumer country conifer plywood production would grow from zero to almost 5.9 million cubic meters, more than off-setting the decline in tropical plywood production.
Sawnwood production in the consumer countries is projected to follow much the same trend under this scenario. Tropical non-conifer sawnwood production would fall from 3.6 million to 1.5 million cubic meters by 2010, with an increase in conifer sawnwood from zero to about 792 thousand cubic meters.

The second alternative scenario introduced into the ITTO analysis incorporated the additional potential substitution of products to further supplement the additional timber supply and conifer substitution. Further, estimated demand is reduced in response to technology advances and substitute products at the consumer level. The combined effects of this substitution assumed in the scenario are summarized in Table 59. The substitution results in a decline in demand for tropical timbers of 23 million cubic meters, primarily for plywood where the estimated reduction of 16.5 million cubic meters represents over 62.5 percent of the base case 'gap' demand of 26.4 million cubic meters. In contrast, sawnwood demand declines by 6.5 million cubic meters, or almost 13.2 percent.
Primary forms of substitution include OSB, MDF and particleboards. Changes at the consumer technology are expected to have a much bigger impact on sawnwood than plywood, accounting for half of the estimated substitution impact on sawnwood, or the equivalent of 3.3 million cubic meters of demand.
The results of this scenario are summarized in Table 60 (log supply and prices), Table 61 (Products Demanded and Outlook for Manufacturing). The overall pattern for log consumption and the consumption of plywood and sawnwood are shown in Figure 43.^14 As with the first scenario, use of conifer timber is projected to increase to almost 12 million cubic meters by 2010, but with a moderate decline in tropical hardwood log consumption over the 1991-2010 period, to 78.1 million cubic meters. This compares with the projected increase under the first scenario where tropical log consumption would increase to almost 100.5 million cubic meters.
^14 Note that Figure 15 uses a double scale. Log consumption is shown on the right hand side, and is discontinuous from the axis, thereby giving a visual impression of a much greater decline and subsequent increase than is the case.
Projected price increases are much more moderate under the second scenario, where product substitution supplements alternative timber supplies. Prices for Indonesia logs are projected to rise only from US$ 98 to US$ 117/cum, while increases for Malaysia and Papua New Guinea are a bit larger, rising to US$ 144 and US$ 113 respectively.
Product demands decline for scenario 2 for 2010 in spite of the lower prices due to the substitution of other products. This is most evident for plywood, where projected consumption would be only 12.5 million cubic meters in contrast to 22.2 million cubic meters under scenario 1 where only timber supply is increased through alternative supplies and conifer substitution.
Manufacturing activities would shift significantly under scenario 2 with consumer and producer country tropical plywood production declining even further. Conifer plywood production would decline in consumer countries as product is substituted for the import of conifer logs as estimated under scenario 1. Production of sawnwood would, however, increase further for the consumer countries, primarily for conifers which are estimated to climb to a production of over 4.1 million cubic meters. Producer countries would see a further decline in both tropical plywood and tropical sawnwood under the conditions of scenario 2, with the introduction of modest production of conifer sawnwood. Tropical plywood would decline to just under 6 million cubic meters, while tropical sawnwood would decline to just under 27 million cubic meters.

Figure 43 shows the results of Scenario #2 in terms of consumption within the Asia Pacific Region. Plywood consumption declines from about 20 million cubic meters in 1991 to about 17 million cubic meters in 2000, with further decline to about 13 million cubic meters in 2010. Sawnwood consumption declines from about 26 million cubic meters in 1991 to under 24 million cubic meters, then increases 33 million cubic metes for 2010.
Log consumption declines, from 91 million cubic meters in 1991 to just over 80 million cubic meters for 1996 before the incremental supplies and conifer substitution become significant. Thereafter, total log consumption increased, reaching 90 million cubic meters by 2010, or approximately the level of 1991. Tropical log consumption would be approximately 78 million cubic meters. The detailed projections for this scenario are given in Appendix 28.
The ITTO analysis also includes a third option, imposing the elimination of all log exports after the year 2000. This alternative would result from political, as contrasted to economic and market, factors. Prior to the assumed introduction of the ban, the outlook would be very close to the results discussed above. After the year 2000, the tropical log supply would decline further, to 71.6 million cubic meters, with prices slightly higher than under the second scenario for Indonesia but slightly less for Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. Product demands drop modestly while manufacturing would decline sharply in consumer countries due to the limitations on tropical logs while conifer production of plywood would increase. Sawnwood production would decline in consumer countries for both conifer and non-conifer tropical outputs. The log export bans would increase both plywood and sawnwood production within producer countries, but by small amounts. Plywood production would increase
from just under 6 million cubic meters (scenario 2) to 6.2 million cubic meters. Sawnwood production is estimated at increasing from 26.9 million cubic meters to 27.7 million cubic meters under the log export ban.

A comprehensive review of the Asia Pacific Region was completed for the Asian Development Bank by Jaakko Poyry Consultants in November 1995. This review, "Status of Forestry and Forest Industries in Asia-Pacific Region" included a review of the forest resources of the region, including non-wood forest products, the forest industry and markets, investments for industrial development. The review also included a review of forest policies for the Asia Pacific region and strategies relative to the role of the Asian Development bank.
Based on the updated database developed in this project, the consultants prepared projections of demand for and supply of commodities and services within the region. The supply analysis was primarily based on the FAO Resources Assessment. Demand projections reflected growth rates for population and economic growth. Product supply projections were developed by the consultant.
This review highlights the critical role of fuelwood within the Asia Pacific region, where fuelwood as an end use accounted for 73.8 percent of wood consumption. Fuelwood consumption was projected to increase by 13.8 percent through 2005, reaching a level of 970 million cubic meters in comparison to 852.7 million cubic meters for 1993. Industrial wood consumption was projected to increase by 40 percent to the year 2005, reaching 333.4 million cubic meters for 2005, an increase from 238 million cubic meters in 1993. Total roundwood consumption would thus increase from 1.1 billion cubic meters in 1991 to over 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2005. Production increases for major product groups are summarized below:
Industrial Wood (mill cum)
Sawnwood (mill cum)
Wood based Panels (mill cum)
Paper and Paperboard (mill T)
Market Pulp (mill T)
The analysis examines prerequisite investments in forestry and forest processing to address the imbalances, and the role of forest policy within the region. Identification of policy failures, many outside the forestry sector itself, and the need for policy incentives are highlighted. These findings are then related to the policy framework for the ADB.
Details of the study forecasts for trends for the Asia Pacific Region are detailed in the report by sub-region and country and are reproduced here in Appendix 30. The overall projections for regional production to 2005 are as summarized above.^15
^15 Minor differences appear in the ADB main report and Annex VII. The detailed Annex tables are included here in Appendix 30.
The projections made in this analysis utilized per capital consumption rates for fuelwood (FAO) and UN medium population forecasts. Modifications based on supply constraints and potential strong substitution in energy use were included. Industrial forest products were modeled using population, GNP (converted to US$), and GDP per capita growth for demand estimation. Production by product, import and export estimates were used to determine apparent consumption. Available forest resources determine raw material consumption. International trade flows balance production and consumption.
Linkages to Extra-Regional Suppliers
As noted throughout this review, the Asia Pacific Region is actually a net importer of timber. It was reported that the Asia Pacific Region had a total roundwood deficit of 32.8 million cubic meters in 1994. This included an estimated deficit of about 17.5 million in conifer industrial roundwood, a surplus of 0.5 million cubic meters of non-conifer tropical industrial roundwood, and a deficit of 1.1 million of non-conifer other industrial roundwood. The apparent consumption of roundwood (fuelwood and industrial) was over 1,164.6 million cubic meters, thus indicating a overall deficit of approximately 2.8 percent by volume. While having a small (1.5 million cubic meter) surplus in non-conifer sawnwood trade, the deficit in conifer sawnwood was significantly larger at 9.7 million cubic meters. Consumption of sawnwood was estimated at 49.5 million for non-conifer and 59.2 million for conifer sawnwood Wood panel net trade was positive, at 712 thousand cubic meters, with apparent
consumption at just under 50 million cubic meters (aphy and Supplemental Sources. Table 62).
Consumption in pulp and paper and paperboard was substantially less balanced, with growing deficits throughout recent years. Wood pulp consumption was 28.3 million metric tons, supported by net imports of over 8.1 million metric tons (28.6 percent). Paper and paperboard consumption was 81.6 million metric tons, with net imports of almost 7.1 million metric tons (8.6 percent).
The studies reviewed here, together with the large body of related reference sources for the Asia Pacific Region clearly indicate a growing dependency of the Region on forestry developments elsewhere globally, both in terms of supply but in the continuing role of markets for Asia Pacific producers.
Only a brief summary is possible of current developments in the countries and regions linked to the Asia Pacific Region. Extensive materials are reported in the literature cited in the Bibliography and Supplemental Sources.

It is well known that the Pacific Northwest region of the US is already into a significant transition involving the shift of large areas of forest into restricted management or non-timber management uses. These changes have been extensively reviewed in the context of global implications through the work of the Center for International Trade in Forest Products (CINTRAFOR) at the University of Washington, Seattle. A series of working papers based on the CINTRAFOR Global Trade Model (CGTM) report the findings and outlook for this region.^16 A base case analysis of a reduction of some 33 million cubic meters harvest in the US Pacific Northwest and from forests in Western Canada in response to land re-allocation and conservation decisions, together with an increase of softwood plywood consumption of about one percent per year as substitution for declining tropical harvests in Malaysia, were reported in Working Paper 43 (Perez-Garcia, 1993).^17 Other regions are projected to
increase production in response to higher prices and greater demand. Based on timber availability and comparative costs, it was projected that only approximately 60 percent of the US and Canada decline could be made up by other suppliers including those in the US and Canada. Approximately 12.2 million cubic meters is provided by increased harvest in the US West from private forests and all forests in the US South and US North regions. This is about one third of the assumed timber reductions.
^16 See the following CINTRAFOR Working Papers:
WP 33, "An Assessment of the Impacts of Recent Environmental and Trade Restrictions on Timber Harvest and Exports", John M. Perez-Garcia, 1991
WP 43, "Global Forestry Impacts of Reducing Softwood Supplies from North America", John M. Perez-Garcia, 1993
WP 47, "The Impact on Domestic and Global Markets of a Pacific Northwest Log Export Ban or Tax", John Perez-Garcia et al, 1994
WP 50, "An analysis of Proposed Domestic Climate Warming Mitigation Program Impacts on International Forest Products Markets", John Perez-Garcia, 1994
Additional analysis related to these issues has been undertaken by the USFS International Trade Research Program. See Flora, "Short-Run Trade Effects of Changes in US Public Harvests" (1994) and Flora & McGinnis, "Effects of New Export Rules, a Spotted Owl Plan, and Recession of Timber Prices and Shipments from the Douglas Fir Region", 1992.
^17 A similar simulation was prepared in CINTRAFOR Working Paper 33 (1991). The detailed results of these two analyses are reported in Appendix 31.
European producers would also increase production, estimated at about 6.8 million cubic meters, equaling about 20 percent of estimated reductions. Some 1.2 million cubic meters are offset by higher production in Eastern Canada, and 0.7 million cubic meters in Japan. Overall, 38 percent of the assumed reduction is not compensated by offsetting increases elsewhere reflecting market effects. Under alternative assumptions where supply from East Russia is presumed to increase in response to US and Canadian shortages by 7.7 million cubic meters, the adjustments in the other US regions and ownership's are reduced, as is the adjustment for Japan and Europe. Overall, the US alternative producers would compensate by increased harvests of about 23 percent, with international producers compensating for an additional 50 percent of the reductions in the US Pacific Northwest and Western Canada. Siberia alone would offset about 25 percent of the reductions. These findings, together with
similar simulations made in 1991 are included in Appendix 31.
Estimates of US production for 2010 for conifer and non-conifer species are summarized in Table 63 based on US Forest Service estimates as reported by ITTO (1995). Conifer supply in the Western US will decline significantly, with the major increase possible in the US South. Overall, the output is forecast to increase to 323 million cubic meters. Much of the increase however (14 million cubic meters) is for fuelwood for cogeneration of energy, leaving only 1 million cubic meters of the increase as industrial conifer harvest. Non-conifer supply is predicted to increase to 265 million cubic meters by 2010, up from 196 million cubic meters in 1900. Of the 69 million cubic meter increase predicted, some 43 million cubic meters would be fuelwood Canadian estimates for the US outlook are for considerably less conifer production, exclusive of fuelwood, with a 43 million cubic meter reduction foreseen in industrial harvest by 2010. Estimates for US non-conifers is also downward as
seen by Canada, from 114 million cubic meters (net of fuelwood) to just 99 million cubic meters in 2010.
Canadian Roundwood production is shown in Figure 44 by log type. Total production in 1980 was about 158 million cubic meters, with 110 million cubic meters in 'logs and bolts', primarily saw and veneer log quality, and almost 35 million cubic meters of pulpwood. Major changes between 1980-1993 reflect general market economic conditions, with the majority of year to year variation reflected in industrial timber harvest. Total production reached a high of over 180 million cubic meters in 1987-1989 before declining, then recovering to about 175 million cubic meters by 1993. Roundwood production by province is shown in Figure 45, indicating the dominant role of western Canadian forests, primarily in British Columbia. Over the 1980-93 period, approximately half of Canadian production has originated in British Columbia. Production in the Atlantic Provinces, Quebec and Ontario have fluctuated between 60-80 million cubic meters, averaging about 70 million cubic meters annually. The
Prairie Provinces, primarily Alberta, have seen production increase slightly from about 10 million to 15 million cubic meters in 1993.
Projections for future Canadian timber supply is shown in Table 64. Conifer production is shown as increasing moderately, to 93 million cubic meters in the West, in spite of predicted declines in British Columbia (down 10 million cubic meters). Eastern Canada is estimated to generate an output of some 77 million cubic meters or 20 million cubic meters above 1990 levels. Overall, Canadian conifer production is forecast at 170 million cubic meters with a significant shift from the west to the east. Hardwood production is much smaller in Canada, at only 19 million cubic meters in 1990, primarily in Eastern Canada. Production is forecast at 50 million cubic meters, with 30 million cubic meters in the East.

The present analyses of the US and Canadian situation indicate that there is little potential for substantial increases in conifer harvests or exports to the Asia Pacific Region in the face of declining supplies, Canadian restrictions on log exports, and growing pressures for export restrictions in the US Pacific Northwest. Declining volumes due to changing land use allocations and conservation constraints on public lands are unlikely to be offset either by other ownership's, either in the US and Canada or globally. Only if substantial response is forthcoming in Siberian Russia does the decline become offset by more than two-thirds.
United States two-way trade with the Asia Pacific Region is important to both trading partners. US exports to major Pacific Rim markets (including Australia) by volume and value are shown in Table 65. Detailed statistics on US trade with the Pacific Rim and Oceania by volume for the period 1984-1995 are included in Appendix 32.
US exports of conifer logs to the Asia Pacific region have dropped sharply, from a high of over 19 million cubic meters in 19989 to just under 9 million cubic meters in 1995. Exports of temperate hardwood logs has also declined, from a high of 572 thousand cubic meters in 1991 to just over 205 thousand cubic meters in 1995 after a low of 198.3 thousand cubic meters for 1994. Softwood lumber exports grew to a high of 4.1 million cubic meters in 1989, but have declines subsequently to 2.4 million cubic meters in 1995. The report of temperate hardwood lumber reached a high of 928 thousand cubic meters in 1988, then declined to below 500 thousand cubic meters for 1990-1994 before increasing to 606 thousand cubic meters for 1995. Softwood plywood exports to the Region were 28.7 thousand cubic meters in 1995, approximately the average since 1990. Exports of hardwood plywood have increased, from only 5.5 thousand cubic meters in 1989 to a high of 50.9 thousand cubic meters in 1992.
Subsequent hardwood plywood exports have been smaller, reaching 30.9 thousand cubic meters for 1995. Other hardwood exports to the Asia Pacific Region include hardwood chips, doubling from 1.6 million metric tons in 1990 to 3.3 million metric tons in 1995. Hardwood flooring, and both conifer and hardwood molding exports have also increased since reporting for this items was initiated in 1990 (Appendix 32).
US imports from Asia Pacific by sub-region are summarized in Table 66 by value. Detailed import statistics by value are also included in Appendix 32 by sub-region and country. US imports increased from US$ 779.6 million in 1985 to almost US$ 1.3 billion in 1992 before declining in 1993-95, reaching US$ 1.1 billion for 1995. As shown in Table 66, these imports accounted for over 20.6 percent of US solid wood imports for 1990-91, but declined to a 12 percent share for 1995. The largest share of US imports from Asia Pacific originate in Insular SE Asia, predominantly Indonesia (US$ 439.3 million in 1995) followed by Malaysia (US$ 158.6 million, 1995). North Asia is the second leading sub-region source for US solid wood imports, led by China at 159.7 million in 1995. Continental SE Asia, led by Thailand, with US $ 107.3 million was the third leading source of US imports from the Asia Pacific Region in 1995.

Canadian exports by province of origin for major forest products is shown in Figure 46. British Columbia accounts for the greatest share of exports for softwood lumber and wood pulp, with lesser shares of newsprint and other forest products. Canadian exports by value have increased significantly from about CAN$ 5 billion in 1975 to almost 32.4 billion for 1994. By volume, exports included 44.9 million cubic meters of softwood lumber, 10.5 million tons of pulp, and 9.4 million tons of newsprint as the major commodities. Summary statistics for Canadian exports by province of origin, destination market, and primary product is included in Appendix 33.
Total Canadian exports by major trading area and product are shown in Figure 47 for the period 1975-94 by value. Clearly the US is the major destination for the majority of all Canadian forest product exports, including over 72 percent of softwood lumber, 42 percent of wood pulp, and 75 percent of newsprint. Overall, the US accounted for CAN$ 22.6 billion of Canadian exports (69.8 percent). Japan was the second leading export market, accounting for CAN$ 3.9 billion in 1994, or 12.1 percent of exports by value. Almost 60 percent of Japan's imports from Canada by value was softwood lumber.
Canadian production from the province of British Columbia and the destination of the small volume of exports of logs are summarized in Table 67. Coastal BC production has remained at 25-26 million cubic meters over the 1990-95 period, reaching a high of almost 26 million cubic meters in 1995. Interior BC production was 53.1 million cubic meters in 1990 and reached a peak of 53.6 million cubic meters for 1993. Production was 50.5 million cubic meters in 1995. Total BC production reached a maximum of 79.2 million cubic meters in 1993, dropping back to 76.5 million cubic meters in 1995. British Columbia has strict restrictions on the export of unprocessed lots, hence total export volume has been small. Exports in 1995 were only 611.8 thousand cubic meters, or approximately 0.8 percent by volume. Over two-thirds of the log exports were to the US, with 133.6 thousand cubic meters going to Japan and 47.5 thousand cubic meters to South Korea. Over half of the exports (335.6
thousand cubic meters) were minor conifer species, almost entirely to the U.S.

New Zealand, Chile and Australia
Considerable attention has focused on Australia, New Zealand and Chile where extensive plantations have been established, primarily of fast growing plantation radiata pine. These countries are seen as a significant emerging source of 'new' timber supply in the Asia Pacific Rim for the future, potentially shifting the nature and patterns of trade.
New Zealand
New Zealand had approximately 1.3 million ha. of exotic plantations as of 1991, consisting of 1.15 million ha. of radiata Pine (90 percent), 65.5 thousand ha. of Douglas-fir (5 percent) 41.6 thousand ha. of other conifers, and 25.6 thousand ha. of hardwoods. The distribution of plantations by age class and status of intensive management treatments are shown in Figure 48. It is clear that the majority of plantations are under 25 years of age, but with large areas maturing within the next decade.^18 Approximately half of the plantations below rotation age have received either intensive management with production thinning or intensive management only. Much of the forest plantation has however minimum tending without thinning. Intensive silviculture, designed to promote faster growth and higher proportions of clearwood grades has received much attention over the past twenty or more years.
^18 Data in Figure 16 is from 1991, hence age classes should be moved forward by five years to the present. Average rotations of 26-28 years for Radiata pine plantations would indicate that the age class shown at 21-25 years is now essentially mature and available for harvest.
New Zealand's harvest has increased sharply since 1989, with the largest share of growing production in the export log quality class. This trend is shown in Figure 49. Total harvest was about 9 million cubic meters annually from 1982 to 1988. About half of this volume was sawlog grade, with a high share of the rest being pulpwood. Export logs were less than 500 thousand cubic meters, and export chips quite small, although chip volume increased in 1986-87. With 1989, total harvest volume grew from over 10 million cubic meters to 15.4 million cubic meters for 1993. Elsewhere, production was reported at just under 16 million cubic meters for 1994 and almost 17 million cubic meters in 1995.
About 4.5 million cubic meters were export grade, accounting for a significant part of the total harvest increase to 1993. During this period, harvest from native indigenous forests declined, from 675 thousand cubic meters in 1985 to 194 thousand cubic meters in 1993, with the greatest share being sawlog grade. Export of logs was almost 4.3 million cubic meters in 1993, increasing to 5.3 million cubic meters in 1995. Exports in 1995 included 3.1 million cubic metes of logs to South Korea and 1.9 million cubic meters to Japan. Smaller volumes were exported to China, Taiwan and the Philippines within the Asia Pacific Region. Sawnwood exports increased from 0.9 million cubic meters in 1993 to just over 1 million cubic meters for 1995, with 304 thousand cubic meters destined for Japan and 371 thousand cubic meters to Australia.

The production of pulp logs and export chips have declined to where production was largely insignificant in 1993 (Table 68). Export of chips increased from 192 thousand (BDU) in 1993 to 303 BDU for 1995.
Projected yields from New Zealand's plantation forests are shown in Table 69 by grade class to 2020. Also shown in this table is the volume expected from clear felling and from thinning yields. Total expected volume (1986) is contrasted with earlier projections of total harvest which were made much earlier (1979).
Anticipate total plantation yield is shown as increasing from 10.4 million cubic meters in 1986-90 to about 24.8 million cubic metes for 2011-15. This contrasts with earlier forecasts of volume at nearly 36.5 million cubic meters by 2011-15. For the 1986 forecast, a total of 23.6 million cubic meters would be from clear fellings, while 1.2 million cubic meters would result from thinnings. Pruned logs with small end diameters of over 30 cm (P1/P2) are expected to increase rapidly after the 1995-2000 period, from 1.25 million cubic meters to over 3.88 million cubic meters. Unpruned logs (S1/S2 and L1/L2) would constitute over half of the harvest at the end of the forecast period.
Later projections of harvest from plantations is shown in Figure 50 The base case projection shows output at about 24 million cubic meters after the year 2000, in comparison with assumptions about various future rates of plantation establishment. Domestic use is also shown, remaining at about 8 million cubic meters up to about 2020. With an increase in planting of 50 thousand ha., yields would increase after the year 2000 reaching about 28 thousand cubic meters after 2010. With plantings of 100 thousand ha. future yields could potentially increase to as much as 60 million cubic meters after 2020.
Chile
Chile has also rapidly developed forest plantations which have a direct influence on timber markets in the Asia Pacific Region. Plantation forests are estimated at approximately 1.75 million ha. consisting primarily of Radiata pine (1.38 million ha.) and Eucalyptus (238 thousand ha.). Over 100 thousand ha. have been forested or reforested annually since 1991 with almost two-thirds planted in Radiata pine.
Projected output for Radiata pine for the future is estimated as growing from about 15.1 million cubic meters in 1990 to 22.2 million cubic meters for the year 2000 and increasing to 23.1 million cubic meters in 2010 and 36.9 million cubic meters for 2020. After 2000, pulpwood is estimated to remain at about 10 million cubic meters, with sawlog production increasing from 8.4 million cubic meters in 1990 to 14 million cubic meters by 2010. Longer term outlook for 2010 is for about 26 million cubic meters of sawlog output.

Basic statistics for the Chile's forestry export sector is summarized in Table 70 for 1995 and early 1996. Exports of almost 1.6 million cubic meters of sawlogs were sent to South Korea. Japan was a small market for both sawlogs and pulpwood Green lumber exports to Japan was estimated at 99 thousand cubic meters, with surfaced dried lumber exports at 181.6 thousand cubic meters. Japan was also a major market for both softwood and hardwood chips.
Australia
Although large in area, Australia is not large in terms of forests. An estimated five percent, or about 43 million ha. are forested. Increasingly, however, Australia is adopting conifer plantations for future timber supply, often based on radiata pine, southern yellow pine, or eucalyptus. As of 1995, Australia's plantations were estimated at about one million ha. Approximately one-fourth of Australia's natural forest is in private ownership, assumed to be available for commercial use. An additional 7 million ha. of public forests are considered suitable and available for industrial timber production. Overall, approximately 19 million ha. currently support Australia's commercial forest base (ITTO, 1995). Tropical forest is estimated at 14 million ha., although almost all of this is removed from the commercial forest base for conservation and environmental purposes.
Under current conditions in New Zealand, Chile and Australia, the ITTO analysis (ITTO, 1995) estimated that combined output was approximately 56.1 million cubic meters, including 27.6 million cubic meters of sawlogs and veneer logs together with 28.5 million cubic meters of pulpwood. Sawlog and veneer log production was almost equal in these three countries, at just over 9 million cubic meters each.
Projected trends for the three countries is summarized in Table 71 and Figure 51 derived from the ITTO assessment. The three-country total production is estimated at 77.5 million cubic meters by 2010, or an increase of almost 21.5 million cubic meters (38 percent). Australia's output would grow to 30.7 million cubic meters with much of the gain in pulpwood. New Zealand's production is here projected to 23.7 million cubic meters, for an increase of over 8.8 million cubic meters (59 percent). Output for Chile is forecast at 23.1 million cubic meters for 2010, an increase of 5.9 million cubic meters. Much of the increase in New Zealand (5.4 million cubic meters) and Chile (4.7 million cubic meters) is in the sawlog and veneer log category. Together with Australia's forested increase in sawlogs and veneer logs (2.9 million cubic meters), total increase in this quality group would be 13 million cubic meters or 60 percent of the total projected increase.
With consideration of the likely domestic consumption of timber in New Zealand, Chile and Australia, ITTO also estimated the likely 'net increment' available for possible export trade with other countries. Table 72 provides a summary of these estimates. Australia is likely to remain a net importer (except for pulpwood), with new incremental supply originating in New Zealand and Chile. The available supply in 1995 was estimated at just over 20 million cubic meters. This is projected to grow to 34.8 million cubic meters by 2010, an increase of 14.7 million cubic meters. New Zealand would have an incremental supply (net of consumption) of 17.7 million cubic meters while Chile would produce a net increment of 17.1 million cubic meters.

Russia: East Siberia and the Far East
The forest sector of Russia, particularly East Siberia and the Far East regions, is also of potential significance to forestry outlook in the Asia Pacific Region. Since 1989, the area of the former Soviet Union has undergone significant political and economic change. The forests of the Soviet Union were primarily included in the territory of the Russian Republic. The outlook for this sector has been the focus of much extensive review and analysis by Backman and Waggener with respect to potential development and trade with the Asia Pacific countries.^19 The Russian forest has experienced considerable stress since the introduction of massive economic restructuring in 1991. As with the rest of the Russian economy, harvest output and forest products production have declined significantly. The Russian forests, particularly in East Siberia and the Far East regions, is relatively undeveloped, thus capturing interests in terms of future potential. However, the distinction between
physical and economic potential is large. This distinction is made all the more important by the ongoing period of transition from planned to market economic structures and the yet undetermined role that prices and markets will play in guiding policies and production in the future.
^19 Backman and Waggener have completed a series of three Working Papers through the research program of CINTRAFOR dealing with the status and outlook of the Russian forestry sector. These include:
WP 28, "Soviet Forests at the crossroads: Emerging Trends at a Time of Economic and Political Reform", 1990
WP 35, "Soviet Timber Resources and Utilization: An Interpretation of the 1988 National Inventory", 1991
WP 46, "The Russian Forestry Sector Outlook and Export Potential for Unprocessed Logs and Primary Forest Products through 2000", 1994
Two additional analyses are presently in final preparation for publication:

The declines in the forest sector of Russia saw the production of roundwood decline to 238 million cubic meters in 1992, almost 30 percent below 1989 output. Output dropped further in 1993, by an additional 18 percent. Lumber production declined by 26 percent in 1993, while plywood production declined by 16 percent and particleboard by 17 percent (Backman & Waggener 1996). Harvest was reported at 174 million cubic meters in 1993 and was expected to decline by as much as one-third in 1994. The Russian Far East produced approximately 8 percent of timber industry output prior to the introduction of economic and political reforms Roundwood harvest of 42 million cubic meters was estimated for the RFE in 1989, declining to 30 million cubic meters for 1992 and 24 million cubic meters for 1993.
Commercial roundwood supply declined from 25.8 million cubic meters in 1989 to 16 million cubic meters in 1992, and to 11.7 million cubic meters in 1993. Accuracy in data reporting has declined, but is was estimated by Backman that 1992 output was approximately 15 percent higher, while unreported harvest in the RFE for 1993 could potentially be as high as 25 percent. Lumber and plywood production declined to approximately 1.2 million cubic meters in 1993, other wood-based panels declined to 0.7 million cubic meters, and pulp production fell to 240 thousand metric tons. Paper and Paperboard production declined to about 300 thousand metric tons by 1993.
Timber harvest in East Siberia in 1989 was an estimated 93 million cubic meters, subsequently declining to 69 million cubic meters in 1992. Commercial wood supply in 1989 was reported at 63.8 million cubic meters, declining to 42.1 million cubic meters in 1992 and 29.1 million cubic meters in 1993. Again, Backman estimated that these reported totals could understate actual harvests, by about 15 percent in 1992 and 1993. Lumber production in East Siberia declined from 19 million cubic meters in 1989 to only 8 million cubic meters for 1993. Wood based panels declined to 550 thousand cubic meters from over 1.1 million cubic meters in 1989. Pulp production declined to about 1.2 million metric tons from 2 million metric tons in 1989.
Russia's exports for 1993-94 are summarized in Table 73 for 1993-94 while Far East exports are shown in Table 74 for 1992. By 1994, moderate stability had returned to the Russian forest sector, although internal domestic markets and consumption continued to experience disruptions and economic uncertainty. As a consequence, the export market was seen as the most promising opportunity for the sector, giving rise to modest increases in both volume and value of wood based exports. As shown in Table 73, all categories experienced gains in 1994, ranging from 6 percent for wood pulp to fifty percent for plywood (by volume) over 1993.

Trade from the Russian Far East has been primarily in unprocessed logs in contrast to European Russia trade. Industrial sawlog trade historically has been concentrated on conifer logs exported to Japan and China. Although trade in sawnwood is substantially smaller, Japan is also the major destination of exports from the Far East. The trend in exports to Japan has been downward, with the decided impact of the 1991-93 reform period evident as is shown in Figure 52. Japan has also been the dominant market for pulp logs and wood chips exported from the Far East region, as shown in Table 75.
Projections for Russian production and trade were formulated for 1990 as a base period with alternative outlook for 1990-95 (Period 1) and 1995-2000 (Period 2). For period two, alternative 'pessimistic', 'middle' and 'optimistic' conditions were assumed, based on the level of stability and economic development, trade relationships, and levels of investment in forest management and industrial restructuring (Backman and Waggener, 1994). A summary of the production estimates is provided in Table 76, with export projections shown in Table 77. The projections are also illustrated in Figure 53.
Lumber production is projected to remain depressed though 2000, reaching an estimated 54 million cubic meters under mid-level conditions. Production in the Pacific Asian region of Russia would recover to about 16 million cubic meters. Panel production would recover to 5.8 million cubic meters, well below 1989 levels, with only 1.0 million cubic meters produced in the Pacific Asian Russia region. Pulp and Paper production also is expected to remain well below pre-reform levels, totaling 5.8 million metric tons by 2000, with Pacific Asian production at about 1.8 million metric tons. Exports of lumber and panels will also remain below pre-reform levels, particularly for exports from eastern Russia. Pacific Asian exports of lumber are projected at 3.3 million cubic meters under baseline (middle) conditions, including 3.0 million cubic meters from European Russia and only 0.2 million cubic meters from Pacific-Asian Russia. Panel exports would be only 0.3 million cubic meters,
essentially from European Russia.
As shown in Figure 53, projected exports under the existing forest resources conditions and the expected political and economic situation during the period 1990-95 (Period 1) were estimated as exports of about 12 million cubic meters. About 7 million cubic meters would be exports from the European region of Russia, consisting of less than 2 million cubic meters of high quality (industrial sawlog grade) with almost 5 million cubic meters of low grade timber (primarily pulpwood). Exports from the eastern Russia regions (primarily the Far East) were estimated at about 3.5 million cubic meters of sawlog quality timber and 1.5 million cubic meters of low grade (pulpwood) materials.
Under the baseline scenario, exports for 1996-2000 were predicted to increase slightly to almost 13.5 million cubic meters, with about 6 million cubic meters exported from the European region - slightly less than in period one due to improving domestic markets and economic conditions. Exports from eastern Russia would, however, increase slightly, to about 7.5 million cubic meters, including 4.5 million cubic meters of sawlog grade materials and 3 million cubic meters of lower grade (pulpwood) timber. Only under unrealistic ('optimistic') conditions would exports rise to almost 30 million cubic meters before the year 2000. The largest impact would be the export of lower grade materials from the European region. Exports from eastern Russia to the Pacific Rim would also rise, to almost 13 million cubic meters, including 7.5 million cubic meters of higher grade sawlog materials and 5.5 million cubic meters of lower grade pulpwood.

Determinants of supply
Forest land base
Uses of the forest
Forest resource conditions & productivity
Harvest modeling
Economics of management
Politics of management
From the extensive studies the Asian Pacific Region reviewed in this study, many factors can be identified that shape and influence the supply of forest products. Many of these factors have been incorporated into the various projection methods used to formulate future outlook estimates for the region. While no attempt is made to list these factors in detail, a general pattern can be identified as to the critical elements for supply estimation.
Forest land base
The most critical factor of course influencing forest output and supply is the estimation of the appropriate land base which is and will be available to support forestry activities. While there are common definitions of forest lands which are widely recognized, different databases have been utilized in various studies which frequently differ as to the appropriate underlying land base.
Forests can exist by definition or policy but not be available in fact for current or future forest use. Legal definitions of forest, for example, often include various types of 'unallocated' lands which do not support forest growth. In-holdings of agriculture and human settlement, horticultural crops, pasture, and other non-forest uses can distort the apparent forest resource base.
Changes in land use into the future are also critical to determination of forest products supply. Lands may be removed from the forest base either by conscious decision or unintentionally. Encroachment of forests and deforestation rates are a highly visible form of land use change. Success in afforestation or reforestation also changes the land base. Development of forest plantations likewise influences the assumed base.
Uses of the forest
Changes in the intended use of forests also impacts the supply of forest outputs, particularly the supply of wood harvest and products. While forestry is wildly viewed as 'timber production', other competing uses are increasingly imposing constraints on the availability of land base for timber. Reservation of forest lands for conservation and wildlife, watershed, recreation and aesthetics, biodiversity and environmental values, and other potentially competing uses may drastically reduce or prohibit commercial exploitation - even under sustainable management constraints.
Determination of the amount of forest for commercial forest production use is critical to the determination of sustainable yields (noted below). Projections of sustainable supply envisions a relatively static or 'permanent' timber estate, capable of continuous cyclic production of harvests. Where the land base in anticipated to diminish over time, sustained yield must necessarily decline where all other factors are constant. A smaller forest estate means, all else equal, less production.
Where mutually exclusive uses are practiced, the forest land base for commercial timber management is either increased or decreased in response to these decisions. However, a equally probably situation is were multiple use management is practiced, with timber supply being only one of several uses of forests, whereby all uses are constrained to some degree below single use potentials. Timber yields may be reduced in favor of improved wildlife habitat, watershed conditions, or protection of biodiversity. These management decisions regarding tradeoffs between uses, and knowledge of the quantitative impact on yields is central to multiple use management. Modified management regimes do not yield fixed proportions of outputs in most instances; rather the relative importance of different mixes of output is a management choice.
Forest resource conditions & productivity
Where the forest land base for production is relatively well identified (current and future), the status of the present resources in terms of actual vs. potential yields, together with assumptions regarding intensive management to increase productivity over time is fundamental to supply estimation. Degraded or under-stocked forests represent a lowering of current potential and by virtue of lower growing stock, reduce growth and future potential. Future rates of degradation and/or stand improvement impact estimates of yields.
Investment rates for forest management can dramatically shape supply over time. Forest output is in fact subject to considerable variation with respect to management decisions which impact growth rates, volumes, and quality. As forestry in the Asia Pacific Region continues to move from natural forest exploitation based on accumulated forest stocks, towards managed forests, the composition of the forest can also change with respect to species mix, diameters, quality, and harvest age. Each of these becomes a critical variable in estimating supply. Various management regimes require added levels of investment, which require assumptions about both cost and future returns.
Harvest modeling
Attempts to implement sustainable forest management and use lead to the application of various stand models or modeling approaches to harvest levels. Where a country or region is presently in a period of transition from natural forest wealth towards managed forests, there is a great potential for imbalances in age classes with either large excesses in inventory on some forests, to large deficits in some age classes. A sustainable harvest model implicitly adopts a 'rotation' of forests where various stands can be partly or entirely harvested at predictable intervals, then reverting to periods of growth while adjacent or other forest provides the harvest on a continuing basis. Ideal stand distributions seldom exist. Policies regarding the use of 'excess inventory' to either support present harvest or to ration inventory to meet age class deficiencies in the future are critical to the determination of both current and future yields. Lower volumes per hectare under intensively
managed forest conditions, with considerable investment, will of necessity draw down existing timber stocks as the transition to management continues. Comparisons of current harvest to future growth will be distorted by the large accumulated volumes. Assumptions of strict "non-declining" or even flow forms of sustainable management require large volumes of current inventory to be withheld from harvest presently in favor of balancing future harvests Assumptions regarding harvest flow conditions and constraints are fundamental to harvest models.
Economics of management
Estimation of timber supply is frequently seen as a physical or biological yield estimation problem given the information about available forest lands, stocking conditions, growth rates, etc. However, future timber supply needs to be recognized as both biological and economic. As noted above, investments are required in order to change forest management regimes. While intensive management may yield more timber, and perhaps sooner, questions regarding the feasibility of that investment in terms of incremental returns dictate careful specification of the underlying economic assumptions. This also implies that information regarding future markets and prices for both roundwood and forest products be integrated into the supply analysis. In many cases, this linkage is not explicit in supply forecasts. Supply response to future economic conditions and prices can significantly alter supply flow conditions. Supply quantities at 2010, for example, will be as much determined by
responses to anticipated prices and returns from forest management as by simple biological productions.
Interdependency in supply decisions between countries and regions is increasing recognized, and essentially communicated through price and cost signals. Prices are seldom 'national' in today's environment. Supply decisions in other countries and regions, interacting in common markets through trade, impact the expectations and realities of each supply source. Uncertainty is necessarily large, given the future nature of the expectations and the imperfections in shared information systems. Probable competitor behavior becomes an essential element of local supply planning.
Economics also influences the levels of utilization and recovery from the 'timber supply'. This starts with the selection of 'commercial species' in a mixed forest stand, the extent of recovery from timber harvested, the efficiency and recovery from harvest to mill (or port), and the conversion of received wood into marketable product. Wastage and damage, 'non-commercial' species left behind or damaged in residual stands, and other forms of sub-marginal utilization of total volumes of a forest impact the actual recovered and utilized 'supply'. Definitions of 'commercial' in terms of length, diameters, quality, species, and value change constantly over time. Projections of these conditions and limits is largely a question of economics.
Politics of management
Forestry is only part technology and biology and part economics. National strategies for development, concerns for particular regions or sectors of the population, questions of self-sufficiency, and other political considerations represent a policy layer over timber supply estimation that is most frequently difficult if impossible to quantify. Decisions regarding land use, levels of public investment and budgets for forestry, guidelines for determination of harvests, etc. are seldom 'rational' economic decisions in a strict sense. Questions of the equity or distributional consequences of forest use may frequently outweigh economic efficiency in management and use.

Determinants of demand and consumption

Availability and price of substitute goods
Tastes and preferences
Economic analysis has recognized the role of key variables in determining demand and consumption. In practice, the distinction between demand (as a schedule of quantities as a function of price, other factors held constant) and consumption as an equilibrium quantity at a given price, is frequently ignored. The development of "gap" type models illustrate the common approach of projecting 'demand' as a fixed quantity independent of price.
Demand, as the relationship between price and quantity, is subject to change over time due to changes in the underlying factors held constant by the static notion of demand. Changes in demand "shifters" are often included in economic estimation of demand representing anticipated dynamics in these determinants.
Levels of income
A key determinant of demand is the level of income evident in the appropriate country or region under analysis. As a generality, the higher the level of aggregate and/or personal income the higher the demand for a typical commodity, including forest products. More of a good or service will be chosen at a given price where income is higher. Thus determinants of demand normally utilize some form of income measure, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Population
Population is of course a key determinant of demand. Although all forest products do not necessarily enter final consumer markets, the actual markets are largely presumed to be functionally related to population. Growing populations are positively correlated to timber demands in the aggregate, as well as specifically to individual forest products. Frequently, population and income estimators are combined, as in the case of the use of Gross Domestic Product per capita.
End market indicators
The use of end market indicators as determinants of demand is frequently incorporated into demand analysis. For example, much of the final use of forest products is linked to construction (residential and total). Indicators and trends related to construction activities, or which are determinants of construction, provide indirect estimates of the influence of these activities as the source of derived demand for wood. Housing starts, public investments, interest rates, etc. can be highly correlated to timber demand.
Availability and price of substitute goods
Consumption choices related to timber are also influenced by the alternative options facing users in the relevant marketplace. The availability of potential substitute products, and their prices, weigh heavily in determining the elasticity of demand, both in the short run (static) sense and over time (long run). Fuelwood, as a dominant use of timber in the Asia Pacific Region, reflects conditions of very limited options for energy sources at 'reasonable' prices. Rural low income or subsistence populations simply do not have 'options' regarding energy - they use wood or go without. Demand, at this basic level, in almost perfectly inelastic. The cost (if only implicit in terms of gathering time) does not materially affect consumption quantity.
Suitability of alternative goods and services is, in part, a question of knowledge as well as availability. Market information regarding alternative products, quality, convenience, and dependability all influence choices. Under conditions of increased scarcity and rising prices for tropical hardwood panels, for example, users have a positive incentive to search for and investigate the suitability of alternatives that were previously overlooked or ignored.
Tastes and preferences
All markets are shaped by collective and individual tastes and preferences. These patterns are partly shaped by culture and partly implanted by information and knowledge of products and services (including the influence of advertising). Different societies use forest products differently because of these differences in taste and preferences. For example, markets for wood products in Japan are commonly recognized as requiring very high product quality standards, the importance of visual attributes of wood, and other preferences not commonly found in many other markets.

Supply, demand and consumption
Demand shifters affect the overall demand function or schedule, rather than indicating a specific quantity that will potentially be consumed under different prevailing conditions. Growth of personal income shifts or increases demand as a functional relationship (to price) or schedule. Consumption will be simultaneously determined through interaction with supply (also a functional relationship with price) as it is also changing over time in response to supply shifters. Obviously, the quantity of timber consumed represents both what is demanded and what is supplied at a prevailing price under current or projected conditions.
This distinction, while relatively easy to define, greatly complicates the identification of supply and demand as normally embodied in the analysis of forestry sector activities and outlook As is clearly noted in the ADB (1995, Chapter 16) discussion of the "Gap Model" outlook projections, this methodological approach fails to capture the essence of supply and demand as a market phenomena.
The extension of conventional supply and demand estimation as separable processes or as 'point' estimates of quantity is the utilization of integrated equilibrium models which simultaneously estimate conditional consumption quantities that represent the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded (not 'supply' and 'demand') at a specified price level.
While there are potentially a large number of equilibrium models or estimation procedures for the forestry sector, the major literature reviewed in this study involves the application of two major efforts. The ITTO sponsored study (1993, 1995) "Analysis of Macroeconomic Trends in the Supply and Demand of Sustainably Produced Tropical Timber from the Asia-Pacific Region" involved the development of the linked "Log Supply Model and the Asia Pacific Tropical Timber Trade Model". In a similar manner, the studies commissioned by ITTO (1993) "The Economic Linkages between the International Trade in Tropical Timber and the Sustainable Management of Tropical Forests", and the World Bank (1993) "Tropical Deforestation in Asia and the Market for Wood" incorporate applications of the CINTRAFOR Global Trade Model (CGTM). Both models utilize similar approaches for estimating equilibrium conditions for multiple products is spatially separated markets. Differential supply and demand
regions are linked through trade, thus explicitly balancing not only country markets but also the multiple markets of the region as a whole.
It was not feasible to compare or contrast the structural components of these two models and their underlying assumptions within the scope of the present study. Each model is highly complex, involving numerous econometric specifications for individual countries and products. Database requirements are extensive to quantitatively estimate the models. Forecasts require the projection or independent estimation of the relevant 'drivers' for both supply and demand for future periods. Under the stated conditions, simulations of probable responses to the major determinants is possible. Hence alternative scenarios have been developed by these studies illustrating the likely range of outcomes under the assumed conditions.
Many questions can be raised regarding the structure and estimation of models, including the spatial equilibrium models discussed above. Specification of regions, and the inclusive countries, is largely a matter of practical ability to desegregate information and to formulate future estimates of the model parameters. Estimation of the underlying economic relationships is critical to model results. Linkages between consumers and producers, including the "rest of the world" primarily through transportation costs (leading to lowest cost transactions and trade flows) can be questioned. It is understandably impossible to fully capture the complexity or detail of the 'real world'. Nevertheless, the application of such an integrated and spatially balanced analysis forces recognition of the interdependencies of supply and demand, and the complex web of interactions beyond any individual country.

"Most likely" scenario towards 2010
A "reasonable" scenario
Role of equilibrium models
Adjustments to the scenario
Sustainable harvests and transitional effects
It was beyond the scope of the present study to fully develop alternative scenarios for the Asia Pacific Region looking forward towards 2010. Rather, the attempt here is to provide perspective on the alternative scenarios discussed previously based on the several major and detailed 'outlooks' for this region.
It is inevitable that the future outlook for the Asia Pacific Region will be for a timber-constrained future. In spite of incremental shifts in supply in individual countries, development of 'new' resources such as rubberwood, and the further expansion of fast growing plantations, it is difficult to escape the logic of the prevailing conclusion that new sources of supply within the region will fall short of the pending declines in harvest from the natural forests of Malaysia and potentially from Indonesia and other current major producers. The growing apparent consumption of timber within the region as was indicated in Table 62 is unlikely to be sustained, let alone the continued growth without a considerable shift to further net regional imports. Extrapolations of 'consumption' strictly as functions of population, GDP or similar relationships independent of price will exaggerate 'demand' and fail to provide useful information for policy decision-making in the Asia Pacific
Region.
It is also clear that much greater consideration must be given to the role of fuelwood in total consumption and the various related issues this consumption raises in connection to the future forest sustainability and productivity. Industrial timber production and consumption is modest in comparison. A preoccupation with the industrial component, as significant as it is, results in a distorted picture of the overall condition of the forestry sector and the probable consequences for the future.

A "reasonable" scenario
Based on the information available from the recent studies of the Asia Pacific Rim, it is judged that the results of the ITTO sponsored analysis ("Analysis of Macroeconomic Trends") developed for Scenario #2 (Incremental Supply and Substitution) as discussed in more detail earlier in this review presently provides the most complete and reasonable probable outlook for the Asia Pacific Region in the near term. This scenario gives recognition to 'new supplies' in the region, including the expanded utilization of rubberwood and possibly coconut, as well as the effects of substitution in both conifer roundwood and new products. The timber supply model incorporates effects of changing timber utilization practices (effectively extending the supply) and the use of new and more efficient logging technology (increasing access and reducing waste) as incrementally linked to cost and timber price. Incorporation of relative manufacturing costs allows for estimation of shifts in the
location as well as the level of production based on lowest-cost considerations, capturing the importance of log (raw material) cost and transportation-distribution costs. Productivity differentials (recovery rates) in different countries reflect the degree to conversion efficiency and comparative advantage. Differential exchange rates equilibrate trade flows in terms of local costs and values.
The projected log supply for Asia Pacific reflects the combined effects of changing tropical harvests (declining) in the Asia Pacific Region together with the offsetting effects of the 'new' supplies potentially available to the region through improved technology and harvesting (at higher costs) and through hardwood-conifer substitution. Changes in projected consumption due to the moderating effect of new supply on prices, and the induced shifts in location for manufacturing are highlighted. The greater use of conifer roundwood leads to greater production in the consumer-importer countries with a projected slowing or decline of tropical hardwood production in the traditional supplier countries.
Product substitution is also reflected in this scenario, with both conifer, temperate non-conifer and reconstituted wood and/or non-wood products dampening the consumption of traditionally consumed tropical hardwood products. Tropical hardwood log consumption would decline moderately, and price increases are dampened due to the offsetting influence of these dynamic market adjustments.
The simulated results of this production-substitution scenario were summarized in Table 59 to Table 6 land Figure 43 and are not repeated here. The quantitative results of this scenario, while appearing 'reasonable' are in themselves not as critical as is the capturing of many of the anticipated dynamic adjustments within the framework of an equilibrium analysis. The use of the Tropical Timber Trade Model, or the similar methodology embodied in the CINTRAFOR CGTM used in two of the other major regional studies reviewed in this report, allows for the systematic interaction of multiple factors influencing timber production, consumption and trade.

Role of equilibrium models
Models such as the "Tropical Timber Trade Model" or the "CGTM" are subject to the modification of underlying assumptions, thereby facilitating the 'testing' of various possible combinations of factors influencing the forestry sector. While data-intensive, the estimation of the underlying supply, demand and cost functions for individual countries, sub-regions or products is critical to the results or outcomes, particularly when projected over long time periods. Likewise, estimates of various elasticity's (responsiveness to price movements) is central to dynamic adjustments and comparative changes in production and consumption, and increasingly to trade flows.
The assumed objective of overall cost minimization of obtaining timber and/or products based on estimated harvesting cost, manufacturing costs, and transportation is obviously a simplification but captures the essence of comparative advantage. Because of the complexity of such models, much detail is sacrificed in terms of aggregation and generalization across countries, markets, timber types, cost structures, etc. Hence the results are subject to possible limitations where more micro-level developments are examined. But, as noted above, the underlying assumptions and relationships can be modified (within the structure of the specific model) and re-evaluated to indicate the relative sensitivity to individual or groups of variables. Drivers, such as population or GDP can also be independently estimated and utilized to determine possible influence on the simulated outcomes.

Adjustments to the scenario
Fuelwood in the equation of Asia Pacific forestry
Estimated elasticity of demand and supply
Conifer and non-conifer sub-sectors
The results for the ITTO Scenario #2 described here, while 'reasonable' are subject to several potential factors influencing the interpretation of results for the Asia Pacific region at present. These conditions are briefly noted here as cautionary and indicative of aspects that may warrant further investigation or analysis.
Fuelwood in the equation of Asia Pacific forestry
The scope of the present study did not permit an examination of the structural formulation of either the ITTO Tropical Trade or Log Supply models. Hence it is not known in detail how the question of fuelwood is modeled in terms of timber supply. However, it is observed here that almost all of the major regional analyses and other studies of the Asia Pacific Region forestry sector examined in the course of the present study focus almost entirely on the commercial or industrial component of timber production and use, with scant attention to fuelwood (or other Non-timber Forest Products). As noted at several instances in this review, fuelwood is the single most dominant form of timber consumption in the Asia Pacific region and will likely constitute the most significant driver of forest sector development in future forest policy throughout much of the Region. Consumption of almost 750 million cubic meters of non-conifer and 96 million cubic meters of conifer timber other than
industrial roundwood (as consumed in 1994) simply cannot be left outside the explicit formulation of future scenarios focused on the approximate 300 million cubic meters of industrial production. There is virtually no discussion of fuelwood in the ITTO Scenario #2 (nor any of the other scenarios for this ITTO analysis or other major studies cited). This could represent a major shortcoming of our present understanding of possible future scenarios for the Asia Pacific Region
Estimated elasticity of demand and supply
The estimation of elasticity's for demand and supply of forest products is difficult and complex, given the diversity of products, markets, price information and measurement and other factors. Cross-product elasticity's are even more elusive in quantitative terms yet critical to questions of substitution. Long run elasticity's do, conceptually, capture substitution as part of the dynamic adjustments of markets in response to changing relative prices. It is well known that elasticity's can change over time as the underlying economic relationships adjust. Hence a 'long term' elasticity for sawnwood for a particular market demand estimated in 1975 may reasonably be expected to differ than the same relationship based on 1990.
A survey of 'recent' estimates of price elasticity for South-east Asian tropical timber was reported by ITTO and is reproduced in Table 78. Both supply and demand elasticity's are included in this review. The time series interval for estimation of the various elasticity's is also shown, indicating that data from the 1970s to the mid-1980's was most commonly utilized. Only the work of Vincent included data reaching to 1989.
Short run elasticity's are limited to the work of Constantino as reported in Table 78, The emphasis here is on the longer term, including the possibilities for dynamic market adjustments including substitution.^20 It is highly possible that in the changing dynamics of globalization of markets and trade for forest products that elasticity's have/are adjusting, potentially upward in absolute values indicating the more likely interdependence of products and markets (including substitutes). This would imply greater and more fluid regional and inter-regional adjustments and a dampening of price impacts over time. This significant influence is captured in the ITTO Scenario #2 (in comparison particularly with the ITTO 'base case' analysis) yet it is impossible to determine the particular significance of the elasticity's utilized in the analysis without the simulation under identical conditions with the exception of changed elasticity's. If long term elasticity's have indeed
increased, it would be expected that the results of Scenario #2 would be even more moderate with higher levels of substitution and perhaps lower supplies from 'new sources' due to the price effects.
^20 It should be noted that demand elasticity's have a negative (-) sign, indicating that price and quantity are inversely related. Supply elasticity's in contrast are positive (+) since higher prices are considered to induce positive (higher) output. Export demand would therefore have negative (-) signs, while export supply would have positive (+) signs for price elasticity's. Elasticity's of substitution would typically be positive (+) since the demand for a commodity would be positively correlated with the price movement of a potential substitute.
Conifer and non-conifer sub-sectors
Because of the large interests in tropical forests of the Asian Pacific region, the primary focus has largely been on the tropical component (sub-sector). However, as this review indicates, within the broader definition of Asia Pacific there is a large and growing importance of the conifer sub-sector, accounting for almost 213 million cubic meters of production in 1994, including 116.6 million cubic meters of industrial roundwood. While the Region had a small (600 thousand cubic meter) net deficit in all non-conifer roundwood (tropical and temperate), the region was experiencing a large deficit (17.5 million cubic meters) for conifer roundwood. Plantations (industrial or commercial) within the Region are favoring conifers as evidenced by New Zealand, China, Indonesia and several other countries. The CINTRAFOR CGTM explicitly models conifer and non-conifer separately by consumer and producer regions. The interactions are not clearly discussed in the case of the ITTO Scenario
#2 outcomes, hence it is not presently possible to fully investigate how the ITTO Tropical Timber Trade Model incorporates the dual nature of the timber sector. It is clear however, that the future scenarios for the Asia Pacific Region will need to fully integrate conifer and non-conifer influences.

Sustainable harvests and transitional effects
The major studies of the Asia Pacific region reviewed in the present study all indicate the need for sustainable management and include some element of sustainability in the elaboration of scenarios. This focus is most commonly implied with respect to Malaysia, and secondarily for Indonesia. However, the adjustment from current (status quo) forest management and harvest levels to sustainable levels is not explicitly determined, either with respect to timing (how soon) or what the underlying motivating parameters are likely to be - policy or otherwise. Further, the path or transition to sustainability is largely conjectural. For Malaysia, significantly large downward adjustments in harvest are implied. Status quo rates of harvest can be maintained for some period of time based on present inventories but only at the expense of significant declines after 2005 as simulated by Perez Garcia for both ITTO (1993) and the World Bank (1992).
There appears to yet be relatively little consensus on what sustainable management means in terms of long run yields, primarily due to differences in the assumed land base available for management and the levels of investment in technology and management. For example, estimates appear to vary for Indonesia from 25 million cubic meters (constant natural forests) to as much as 32.8 million cubic meters (investment and plantation development). Estimates for Papua New Guinea vary from 5 million cubic meters (as much forest management "as possible") to over 15 million cubic meters ("all forests"). Estimates for the Philippines, Sarawak, Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia are also conditional on the basis of assumptions about both area and investment.
In practice, it can be assumed that reaching sustainable management levels will be slowed throughout much of the Asia Pacific region because of national interests and forest policies, as well as philosophical differences regarding the practical meaning of 'sustainable'. Informal tabulations of "sustainable" for the purposes of this review indicate outputs varying from about 56 million to 75 million cubic meters for the major tropical producers of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. This is presumed to be focused on the industrial roundwood component, exclusive of fuelwood although this is seldom made clear in most discussions of sustainability. This compares to a Regional production of an estimated 170 million cubic meters in 1994. The utilization of existing inventory stocks during some period of transition is most critical for Malaysia while the utilization ratio of harvest to inventory stocks is more favorable for Indonesia.
It is possible that the ultimate constraint of sustainability will be policy driven as a true constraint on production and markets, with both the transitional and long term policies yet to emerge. How these political factors will be incorporated into quantitative models of scenarios other than by assumed rates of harvest change as exogenous variables will remain to be determined. The levels of harvest utilized in the ITTO Scenario #2 appear to be above the more conservative estimates of 'sustainable' presently available in the regional literature on this issue.

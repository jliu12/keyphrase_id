Agribusiness Handbook.
Grapes / Wine.
This publication was prepared by the FAO Investment Centre under the FAO/EBRD cooperation agreement to provide quick technical and economical reference material to EBRD's agribusiness team in sub-sectors where they often work. Focus was given to the Bank's countries of operation in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with indicators of technical and economical performance in other regions of the world noted for comparison. The series of handbooks contained in this publication cover specific agribusiness sub-sectors, with information on production and processing techniques, costs and margins, world production, prices and trade trends. Data were collected from a number of official and unofficial sources as indicative information that should be interpreted with caution, and do not imply the expression of any opinion by FAO concerning the economic situation of countries mentioned.

FAO / EBRD Agribusiness Handbook vol.5 - Grapes / Wine.
Wine, a beverage made from the partial or complete fermentation of fresh grapes, is as old as documented history. Over time a relatively simple process has evolved a complex technology with its own distinct and immensely diversified "viniculture". In terms of variations in the composition and condition of raw materials; in terms of the nuances introduced over several centuries into processing parameters and their control, replete with many options for the winemaker; and in terms of the scores of variations of the final products, the making of wine is probably not rivalled by any other commodity in the field of food and beverages.
1- GRAPES CULTIVATION.
Key production parameters.
Climate More than 90% of the grapes grown today are varieties of just one vine species, Vitis vinifera. This species is also known as the Old World or European grape. As a consequence most grapes are markedly limited by certain climatic conditions: · · · · reasonably long growing season (150 - 180 days) relatively low humidity but sufficient soil moisture mild winters - frosts occurring after vine growth starts in spring will kill off most of the fruitful shoots variations in the microclimate, location and topography of individual vineyards contributes to the diversity of wines and their respective quality.
Soils Grapes can be produced on a number of soils - fertility is not as important as soil structure: · · · sandy or gravelly clay loams are most desired, differing soil attributes are reflected in wine diversity alkaline soils must be avoided good drainage is very important.
Viticulture Parameters of growing grapes (depending also on the use for wine, table grapes and raisins) include: · · · · · spacing of vines in uniform rows for easy cultivation propagation by cuttings, buds or grafts (propagation from seeds usually just for producing new varieties) planting, usually of 1-year old vines of desired fruiting variety and vine support essential for satisfactory vine growth pruning and thinning, removal of vegetative parts to establish and maintain the vine in a form that will save labour, facilitate cultivation and helps to control insects and diseases, expedites harvesting and improves quality cultivation and irrigation, depending on climate topography and soils.

Total world production & main producers.
The period from 1986-1990 was characterised by a decline of world wine production compared to the preceding period 1981-1985: The annual average shifted from 333,552,000 hl to 303,793,000 hl (minus 9%). During 1991-1995 this trend continued with an annual average of 261,279,000 hl representing a reduction of 14% compared to the previous five-year period. Since 1995, this trend has been reversed. With 251,576,000 hl in 1995, 269,970,000 hl in 1996 and 264,422,000 hl in 1997 world production follows an upward trend for which the explanations range from strong demand for Reds and expansion of vineyard area, the "millenium - effect", to increased consumption of wine in Asia, the United States and the United Kingdom. The world market for wine has changed from its traditional regional orientation to a highly international commodity. Wine producers, processors and traders expect continued growth in wine consumption, with the main increases in countries outside Europe (Japan and emerging economies) and in those European countries without own production. Europe as the centre of the wine culture, of production and consumption faces increasing competition from the "new" wine world in North and South America, in Australia and South Africa. The Wine sector in these countries is characterised by concentration in relatively few globally active companies with their own production and marketing.

In the second half of the 1990ies, the big European Wine producers, although still world market leaders (Italy and France in particular) have lost part of their traditional European markets United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia due to small harvests and strong competition.
At the same time countries of south-eastern Europe have continued quality improvement and gained market access (i.e. UK and Germany) financed to a large extent by Western wine companies. Romania has been particularly successful in increasing its exports in 1994 and 97 (see table below). Hungary and Bulgaria are also expected to increase their market share with relatively low prices for good qualities and packaging at international standard. Poland bottles and re-exports imported bulk wines. Countries of the Former Soviet Union have had their planted areas substantially reduced. Georgia has lost 10,000 ha and Ukraine 9,000 ha between 1995 and 1997.

Wine Imports.
Per capita consumption in 1997 was highest in Luxemburg (63 litres/year), France (60), Italy (59) and Portugal (56). With around 30 litres Romania is the country with the highest per capita consumption in Eastern Europe. The biggest wine importers were Germany, United Kingdom, France, USA, Russia, Belgium and the Netherlands who together account for 70% of all wine imports. France on third place for imports has to be qualified: Most imported wines are relatively low quality bulk wines from Italy or Spain that are used as basis for table wines "d'origine communautaire".

In a direct comparison of 119 conventional with 41 organic wineries in Germany, the conventionally managed ones were found to be more profitable. This is mainly due to substantially lower yields in organic production that are not sufficiently compensated by higher prices. Like in Germany, grape and wine production in the main producing countries is an integrated operation particularly in the field of quality wines.
Average margins for producers.
In a non-representative study 220 wine producers/vineyards (with direct marketing) of different wine-growing regions in Germany were analysed over five years for the correlation between structural characteristics and economic performance. The results are used as an indication for the factors governing economic success. Obviously, these vary immensely between countries and types of production. Labour productivity and profit margins indicate that it is not necessarily the bigger producers who are producing more profitably. The survey shows that it is rather the ability to move into the high quality segments of the market while keeping costs under control than pure cost minimisation strategies that seem promising under the structural parameters of Germany.

2- GRAPES PROCESSING INTO WINE.
Process description (simplified).
Crushing, Macerating, Pressing.
Depending upon the variety of the grape, the water content of a ripe berry will range between 70 and 80%. In any crushing macerating and pressing operation applied to a mass of berries, there is an inevitable mixing of both solid and liquid components. A reasonably complete separation of liquid (juice) components from the grape therefore requires more than one crushing or squeezing operation. The amount of components picked up from skins and stems has a marked effect on the wine's characteristics, sometimes beneficial, sometimes injurious. Grape juice and/or the mass of crushed grapes on the way to wine production are called must. The grape pressings, i.e. the mass of skins and seeds left after the juice obtained from the first pressing is known as marc or pomace.
Musts and Marc.
Sulfiting of Musts.
Sulphide dioxide is used for its antiseptic and antioxidant properties for treatment of must (dosage usually 100 200ppm). For red wines, small quantities are added to fully destroy spoilage bacteria and the presence of unwanted yeast. In white wine, the functions are similar and, SO2 prevents development of brownish colouring. In dealing with a lack of uniformity of raw material from one season to the next with regard to sugar content and acidity these factors are sometimes purposefully altered by adding sugar, water or acid. This practice is ether frowned upon or in some regions even outlawed completely if not warranted by natural causes (i.e. disadvantageous weather conditions).

Fermentation (2-20 days).
Initial slow stage, multiplying yeast cells Vigorous stage : Gas "bubbling", rising temperature "Quiet fermentation" that can proceed for long period at a lower and lower rate.
Drawing off.
Depending on the type of wine, size of winery, traditional practices etc. wine may go to large or small storage tanks, casks or it remains in the fermentation tubes for several days.
Maturing and Ageing.
In various stages "green" wine matures into an acceptable market product: settling of finely divided solid particles and colloidal materials, subtle and slow chemical reactions involving aldehyds, esters etc. that enter into the ultimate bouquet of a wine. Around 90% or more of the wine produced is for the mass market and relatively early consumption. Most of this is pasteurised which inhibits or halts subsequent improvements.
Conversion factors from raw material.
The amount of juice obtained from the first pressing usually will range from 60 to 70% of the ultimately attainable juice and is known as free-run juice. For some wines this juice is processed separately.
Parameter Ranges for Musts.
Type of Wine White table wine Red table wine Sweet table wine Dessert wine.

Degrees Balling = grams of sugar per 100 grams of juice. Multiplication of the Balling reading by 0.55 will give the approximate future alcoholic content by volume of the wine. Thus 22 degrees Balling should give 0.55 x 22 = 12% alc. wine.
Wine Quality and Prices.
The table below shows the variation in the prices of red wine produced in different regions of France, and illustrates how widely prices vary even when one takes only the average for a region. If the prices obtained by individual growers were considered, the variations would be even greater.

Premium wines of Bordeaux (Médoc, Graves, St. Emilion, Pomerol) sell at twice or more the average price of wines from the bulk-producing areas of both "ordinary" Bordeaux and other south-west reds, and three times the average price of wine from Languedoc Rossillon.
Wine types and labels.
Champagne, Madeira, Port, Sherry, Sparkling Wine, Vermouth any many more are examples for the special kinds of processes that lead to very different products. These have been ignored in this context in spite of their economic importance in order to be able to concentrate on the main issues of wine production. To understand the "product" wine on the retail level one has to understand the labels. Generally there are two systems with a large number of variations: · The French system works according to the origin of a wine. The origin and the adherence of a vintner to certain standards and practices in the production of the wine, is documented by the Appellation d'Origine Controlée (A.O.C.). The A.O.C. also sets out standards for the quality of wine which range from Vins Délimités de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS--the best quality) to Vins de pays ("country wines") to Vins ordinaires (ordinary wine). With varitions, the A.O.C. system is used throughout Europe. In Germany, detailed origin, the type of grape and sometimes also reference to the taste of the wine is made on the label. French Bordeaux is made from a blend of grapes. It might contain, for example, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The amounts differ (for example, in the Bordeaux appellations St. Emilion and Pomeral, Merlot tends to be the dominant grape, while in the Medoc (Paulliac, St. Esteph, Margaux, and St. Julien), Cabernet Sauvignon is dominant. The U.S. system is based on the type of grapes that are used for wine production. In the United States, a wine cannot be called by its varietal name unless that grape is at least 75% of the wine. As a merchandising tool, a new name has reached the marketplace. Producers in the United States creating blend wines (usually with less than.
75% of any particular grape) have agreed to use the term Meritage to designate a high quality wine using Bordeaux style blends of grape varieties. Winemakers may also put a very specific area from which their grapes are harvested on the label. Often (but not always), "better" (or at least more expensive) wine comes form a "better" vineyard. In the United States there are places called "Approved Viticultural Areas" or AVA. If 75% of the wine is grown in that AVA the AVA may be placed on the label.

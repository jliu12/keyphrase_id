On 8 November, the second day of the Conference, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Secretary of State of the Holy See, delivered a message to the Conference participants on behalf of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. He voiced the Pope's strong support for multilateral cooperation in the search for international social justice, and the importance of all individuals in alleviating world hunger.
C. Presentation of the B.R. Sen awards for 1996 and 1997
3. The awards, honouring the name of the late B.R. Sen, Director-General of FAO from 1956 to 1967, are conferred annually. Each year, the award is presented to the field officer who has made the most outstanding contribution to the country or countries to which he or she has been assigned.
4. The 1996 award was conferred to Mr. Hon Tat Tang, a national of Malaysia, in recognition of his major contribution to the work of the South Pacific Forestry Development Programme in Fiji. Under his leadership the South Pacific Forestry Development Programme had provided an effective and interactive forum that had elevated the forests and trees sector into regional prominence. Mr. Tang was unable to come to Rome to receive the award, and it was collected on his behalf by Mr. Sofara Aveau, Director of Agriculture, Forests, Fisheries and Meteorology, Samoa.
5. The award for 1997 was conferred on Mr. Les Clark, a national of New Zealand, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to fisheries policy and planning in Namibia. During the past five years as Special Adviser to the Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources in Namibia, Mr. Clark had designed, documented and assisted in the implementation of a policy of fishing rights and quotas which had made a substantial contribution to the restructuring and strengthening of the Ministry of Fisheries.
D. Presentation of the A.H. Boerma award for 1996-97
6. The A.H. Boerma Award is presented biennially to a journalist or journalists whose work has helped to focus attention on important aspects of food problems, and has stimulated interest in, and support for, measures leading to their solution.
7. The award for 1996-97 was shared by the Association of Food and Agriculture Journalists (AFAJ) of Kenya, for its strong commitment to the coverage of food, agricultural and environmental issues with particular reference to the water hyacinth weed multi-media campaign; and to the Inter Press Service (IPS), a Third World news agency based in Rome, for its significant contribution over the past thirty years to covering sustainable agriculture and rural development issues in more than one hundred countries, thereby filling the information gap between developed and developing countries.
E. Presentation of the Edouard Saouma award for 1996-97
8. The Edouard Saouma Award is conferred biennially on a national or regional institution which has implemented with particular efficiency a project funded by the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP).
9. The Award for 1996-97 was shared by two national institutions, one from the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and the other from the Islamic Republic of Iran, for their outstanding contributions to the implementation of TCP-funded projects. The Award was received by the representatives of these two institutions.
10. The Department of Fisheries of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock of Bangladesh, represented by Mr. Liaquat Ali, had developed a "Trickle-Down" Extension System, that was successful in disseminating an improved, appropriate, pond-fish culture technology throughout the country under a TCP project. The concerned FAO technical unit for the project was the Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service (FIRI) of the Fishery Resources Division.
11. The Technical Infrastructure Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Islamic Republic of Iran, represented by Mr. Darab Malekghasemi, had effectively contributed to improving the water management situation in the country under a TCP project. The concerned FAO technical unit for the project was the Water Resources Development and Management Service (AGLW) of the Land and Water Development Division.
12. Both projects succeeded exceptionally well due to the dedication, enthusiasm and drive of the national staff, and the commitment by their technical counterparts in FAO both in the field and at Headquarters. In their acceptance speeches, the representatives of the two national institutions briefed the Conference on the achievements and catalytic effects generated by the TCP-funded projects and thanked the Organization for the valuable assistance it had provided.
F. In memoriam
13. The Conference observed one minute of silence in memory of those staff members who had died in the service of the Organization since the Conference had last met. The names of the deceased staff members were read aloud and are contained in the Verbatim Records of the Conference.

III. Resolution 1/97
A. The conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture
B. Major trends and policies in Food and Agriculture
A. The conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture
THE CONFERENCE,
Considering the importance given in Agenda 21 to promoting the conservation and utilization of biotic and abiotic resources for sustainable agricultural development of the world and the role of genetic resources for the promotion of sustainable agriculture and rural development,
Noting the call of the FAO Council, of the 7th Session of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for an effective and speedy completion of the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources,
Welcoming the outcome of the 4th International Technical Conference on Plant Genetic Resources, in particular the Leipzig Global Plan of Action as adopted,
Recalling the World Food Summit Plan of Action committed governments with the support of international institutions to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity:
1. Emphasizes that the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture is a key objective in FAO policies and relevant programme areas and is a priority issue in the 1998-99 Programme of Work and Budget;
2. Encourages FAO to collaborate closely with the Executive Secretary of the CBD;
3. Calls upon Member Nations to continue negotiations for the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources in a constructive spirit of compromise in order to be able to report considerable results to the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to finalize these negotiations, as early as possible;
4. Invites members to contribute extra-budgetary resources to support the convening of extraordinary meetings, if needed, necessary to finalize the negotiations;
5. Encourages FAO to facilitate and promote the implementation of the Leipzig Global Plan of Action, as adopted, by all stakeholders;
6. Recommends that FAO study the possibility of assisting developing countries in projects in conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture in collaboration with UNDP, the World Bank and UNEP.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Major trends and policies in Food and Agriculture
The World food summit and its follow-up
49. The Conference endorsed the report prepared by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) and submitted to it through the Council, in accordance with Resolution 2/95, on all aspects of the World Food Summit and its follow-up. It expressed appreciation for the contribution of all concerned to making the Summit a success and, stressing the importance of maintaining the momentum generated in order to permit achievement of the Summit's goals, welcomed the information provided on action already undertaken to ensure follow-up at the country, regional and international levels.
50. The Conference underlined the primary responsibility of national governments for implementing the WFS Plan of Action, and supported arrangements already made by the CFS for monitoring implementation, drawing mainly on national reports. Noting that the June 1998 session of the CFS would be crucial to establish a benchmark against which future progress would be measured, the Conference urged all countries to submit their reports on the first year of implementation of the Plan of Action by 31 January 1998, and subsequent reports in an equally timely fashion, to enable the CFS to fulfill the crucial role assigned to it by the Summit.
51. The Conference recalled that reporting on follow-up to the International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) would already occur as part of the monitoring of implementation of the WFS Plan of Action. Considering the scope of the Plan of Action and its coverage of the goals and issues covered by the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (WCARRD), the Conference considered that progress reporting could be covered in the CFS process, and therefore decided to discontinue separate progress reporting on WCARRD. It recommended that ECOSOC, which would be receiving reports on WFS follow up, adopt the same approach.
52. The Conference underlined the importance of coordination and cooperation within the UN System in the follow-up to the World Food Summit. In view of the multi-disciplinary nature of food security, the Conference encouraged other organizations, in particular those of the United Nations system, to participate actively in supporting follow-up efforts, and to provide information on their activities to the CFS. Bearing in mind the calendar of meetings in the forthcoming biennium, the Conference requested the CFS to provide, through the Council, a first report on implementation of the WFS Plan of Action to ECOSOC in 1999. It further decided to examine progress in follow-up to the World Food Summit at its Thirtieth Session in the same year.
53. During the debate many Member Nations reported on actions taken or underway at national level to implement the Summit commitments, including the preparation of national reports and action plans. Several countries also indicated that in preparing their plans or their reports to the CFS, they were making active efforts to involve all stakeholders, including civil society organizations. In this connection, it was recalled that the CFS would be considering ways of facilitating broader participation by non-governmental observers in its work. It was also noted that at the 1998 session of the CFS, the original reports to the CFS from all countries and organizations would be made available for reference. The Secretariat would provide a synthesis of these reports to facilitate the work of the Committee. With regard to the regional and subregional dimensions of the Plan of Action, the Conference noted that one full day would be devoted, by each FAO Regional Conference in 1998, to
the question of Summit follow-up, and that the results of these debates would be reported in due course to the CFS and to the Council. Mention was also made of the need to give special attention to the particular problems of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), if possible by convening a special conference at an early date.
54. The Conference welcomed the establishment of the ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security, operated jointly by FAO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in close cooperation with the World Food Programme (WFP), as an important means of ensuring a multi-disciplinary input by the UN system to support national efforts to implement the Plan of Action. It was noted that the network was conceived as a two tiered mechanism, with a focus on action at the country level undertaken by inter-agency thematic groups on rural development and food security operating within the UN Resident Coordinator system. At the headquarters level, the network was to provide support for country level action and obtain feedback on experience which could be shared, as well as to facilitate dialogue between participating organizations largely through electronic means. It would also serve as a channel to mobilize reporting on follow-up to the WFS by UN System
organizations, as required by the CFS, to monitor progress on the Plan of Action.
55. The Conference noted with appreciation the initiative taken by FAO to play a catalytic role in elaboration and definition of a Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS) in collaboration with concerned UN System organizations, competent national institutions and non-governmental organizations, and supported plans for its further development. It considered that accurate and timely data was fundamental to national and international response to the problem of hunger and malnutrition, and stressed the need for full participation by developing countries in the establishment of national FIVIMS to be linked within the decentralized international system. The Conference was informed that arrangements envisaged reliance to the maximum extent possible on existing data bases and mechanisms. The suggestion was made that the range of partners could be broadened to include other large-scale data bases covering themes related to food security.
56. The Conference welcomed the conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding of May 1997 between FAO and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and expressed its support for the actions being taken. It welcomed, in particular the holding by the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights of a general discussion on 1 December 1997 on the normative content of the right to food, to be followed by an expert seminar to better define and propose ways to implement the right to food, organized by the High Commissioner with support from relevant UN agencies including FAO. In this connection, one country raised a question as to the appropriateness of FAO providing technical assistance to the Committee or the High Commissioner on this matter. Some countries stressed the importance of national legislation on the right to food, with the assistance of FAO where necessary.
57. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:
<section>4</section>
IV. Resolution 2/97
A. Right to food
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, adopted by the World Food Summit in 1996, in particular Objective 7.4,

"
Expressing deep concern at the widespread phenomenon of chronic undernutrition, in particular among women and children in developing countries, and at the fact that more than 800 million people throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs,
Noting Resolution 1997/8 of the Commission on Human Rights, in which the Commission endorses the request made to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights by the World Food Summit,
Noting that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is committed to achieving a better definition of the rights related to food and to propose ways to implement and realize these rights,
Noting also that the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will be holding a general debate on the normative content of the right to food in Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at its forthcoming session, on 1 December 1997,
Recalling that the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be celebrated on 10 December 1998,
Recognizing the important contribution by FAO to the follow-up of Objective 7.4 of the World Food Summit Plan of Action in co-operating with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Commission on Human Rights:
1. Welcomes the work already undertaken by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the right to food and the cooperation in this respect with FAO;
2. Urges the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to give priority to her ongoing work on a better definition of the rights related to food in Article 11 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to propose ways to implement and realize these rights as a means of achieving the commitments and objectives of the World Food Summit, taking into account the possibility of formulating voluntary guidelines for food security for all;
3. Invites the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to inform the Committee on World Food Security, at its next session on the progress of her work in this regard;
4. Welcomes the intention of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to hold a general debate on the right to food and encourages it to continue paying particular attention to the right to food in its work;

6. Urges the Member Nations of FAO, at the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1998, and on the occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to reaffirm the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
58. In referring to initiatives launched by FAO to assist countries in pursuing Summit objectives, several Members made particular reference to the FAO initiative to prepare draft documents on national strategies for agriculture and food security towards the year 2010. A number of Members supported the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS). Some Members mentioned the positive roles of the SPFS, such as the replicability of the modules, and its role as a catalyst for mobilizing investment resources and triggering policy reforms. A number of Members welcomed the South-South Cooperation Scheme, including one country where the Scheme was operational and had been successful in transferring technology, contributing to a doubling of grain yields.
59. The Conference welcomed the information provided on the first TeleFood (TeleFood 1997) which had taken place on 19 October 1997, in connection with World Food Day, with the main aim of raising awareness and mobilizing support around the globe for the fight against hunger and malnutrition. It noted that in accordance with the provisions of Financial Regulation 6.7 and the General Rules of the Organization, the Director-General would be reporting to the Finance Committee on the collection and utilization of the TeleFood proceeds. One Member Nation, concerned about possible competition with NGO activities, stated that it could not consider itself bound to promote TeleFood nationally.
60. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:

Noting that the review of the Programme was undertaken by the Executive Board of the World Food Programme at its Annual Session of 1997 and by the FAO Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session,
Having considered Resolution 1/112 of the FAO Council as well as the recommendations of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme,
Recognizing the value of multilateral food aid as implemented by WFP since its inception and the necessity for continuing its action both as a form of capital investment and for meeting emergency food needs:
1. Establishes for the two years 1999 and 2000 a target for voluntary contributions of one billion United States dollars (2.1 million tonnes);
2. Urges Member States of the United Nations and Members and Associate Members of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and appropriate donor organizations to make every effort to ensure the full attainment of the target;
3. Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in cooperation with the Director-General of FAO, to convene a Pledging Conference for this purpose.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)

66. The Conference recognized that the functions of the Interim Secretariat and the Convention Secretariat would require additional financial resources. It noted that the financial mechanism for the Convention and the financial arrangements for the Interim Secretariat would be discussed at the next INC. It also noted that the resources required for the implementation of a Convention would normally be provided by the Parties to the Convention. It agreed, however, that resources presently allocated under the Regular Programme for the present voluntary procedure would remain available for the execution of the Secretariat functions.
67. The Conference took note of the offer by Switzerland to provide host country facilities to a possible future UNEP part of the Joint Secretariat. The Conference drew attention to the fact that decisions on this matter would need to be made by the Diplomatic Conference.
68. The Conference stressed the necessity of providing appropriate technical and financial assistance to developing countries, to enable them to implement the obligations under the Convention, and to enhance their capacity to manage pesticides.
69. The Conference then:
a) Authorized the participation of the FAO Secretariat in an Interim Secretariat and in a Secretariat to the Convention if so desired during the negotiations and adopted by the Diplomatic Conference, provided that such arrangements were satisfactory to the Director-General and that costs additional to the implementation of the present voluntary procedure be met through extra-budgetary resources.
b) Agreed to accept changes in the voluntary PIC procedure, if so decided by the Diplomatic Conference, provided that costs additional to the implementation of the present voluntary procedure be met through extra-budgetary resources.
D. Desert locust situation: Measures taken and further action required
70. The Conference noted that although the overall Desert Locust situation was relatively calm, active locust populations with the potential to increase rapidly in numbers continued to be present in certain areas. The Conference recommended that locust-affected countries, supported by donors, maintain a high level of vigilance in the Western (West and North-West Africa), Central (the Red Sea countries) and Eastern (South-West Asia) Regions, especially in, or adjacent to, the active areas. In this context, the Conference called on locust-affected countries to continue the process of sustaining and strengthening their locust survey and control teams as the fundamental element of successful preventive locust control.
71. The Conference expressed its satisfaction with the progress made in establishing the EMPRES (Desert Locust) Programme in the Central Region, and in formulating an extension of the Programme to the Western Region. It was noted that the Central Region field programme was almost fully operational and was already having a significant impact on improving the Early Warning and Early Reaction capacities of participating countries. Much work remained to be done to minimize the possibility of locust plague development in the Region. The Conference called on the locust-affected countries and the international community to continue to support the on-going Central Region programme, and urgently to extend this support to the implementation phase of the Western Region.
72. The Conference recommended that locust-affected countries re-evaluate existing regional locust control structures in order to achieve an appropriate and efficient geographic coverage taking into account the effectiveness of these structures, and to establish a realistic financial provision that would assist affected Member Nations to take common action.
73. The Conference recommended that FAO continue to mobilize the neccessary resources to develop research programmes in the field of locusts, with the view to a greater participation in these programmes of researchers from the countries in the invasion areas.
74. The Conference noted the promising development of new products that can be used at low dosages. The Conference recommended that emphasis be given to further research on, and the application of, these new products, as well as alternatives to chemical pesticides, including biological controls, which would minimize the negative effects of locust control on the environment. The Conference further recommended that attention be given, through EMPRES, to studies on locust control strategy development, with a view to using the most effective and sustainable strategy for each situation.
75. The Conference took note of the persistent problem of obsolete pesticides left over from previous anti-locust campaigns and recommended that FAO take all measures aimed at finding solutions for their elimination.
76. In respect of locusts other than the Desert Locust, several members stated that these species posed a serious threat to food security. Special mention was made of the Red Locust in Central and Southern Africa. The Conference recommended that FAO, in collaboration with donor countries, consider providing assistance on coordination and control of the Red Locust. The Conference further recommended that FAO establish links between SADC countries in Southern Africa and the countries affected by Desert Locusts so that research results and operational experiences could be shared.
E. Programme against African trypanosomiasis (PAAT)
77. The Conference endorsed the objectives and structures proposed for PAAT in recognition of its concern over the considerable adverse impact of trypanosomiasis on agricultural production and human welfare, and for PAAT's potential to contribute to the objectives of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.
78. The Conference reiterated the strong concern expressed by Council that the proposal had not first been submitted to FAO's technical bodies for consideration, but nevertheless agreed with Council that owing to the importance of the subject to food security formal recognition of PAAT should not be delayed.
79. The Conference stressed that:
a) the main emphasis of the Programme should be on supporting action at the country level to advise and assist with the coordination of research and control activities;
b) sustainable control activities were essentially linked to efforts at the local and national levels;
c) follow-up action taken towards the further development and strengthening of PAAT should also take into account the need to facilitate South-South cooperation, which was of great interest in all the activities of FAO.
80. Noting the potential offered in the area of trypanosomiasis control for cooperation at the regional and institutional levels, the Conference recorded its appreciation of the inter-agency collaboration established through the PAAT Secretariat.
81. On being informed that no additional funding was necessary to cover the core activities over the next biennium, the Conference adopted the following Resolution:

VII. Resolution 5/97
A. The programme against African trypanosomiasis (PAAT)
B. Activities and programmes of the organization
A. The programme against African trypanosomiasis (PAAT)
THE CONFERENCE,
Recognizing the severity of the impact of tsetse and trypanosomiasis on livestock, agriculture and human welfare in Africa,
Being well aware that the disease has negative implications for attaining the objectives of the
World Food Summit Plan of Action,
Welcoming FAO's initiative to secure international collaboration and coordination through the
Programme Against African Trypansomiasis (PAAT):
1. Urges all member Nations affected by the disease to: a) reinforce their efforts to combat the disease; b) coordinate their actions through PAAT and the Joint FAO/WHO/OAU/IAEA Secretariat to this Programme.
2. Requests the Director-General:
a) to further define and pursue how the potential offered by PAAT may contribute to the broader objectives of Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD);
b) to consolidate international action in trypanosomiasis control by formalizing, through an exchange of letters, the collaborative links required with WHO, IAEA, and OAU in order to effectively establish the Joint PAAT Secretariat;
c) to give formal recognition, within FAO, to the PAAT Programme Committee;
d) to afford PAAT the priority, profile and appropriate resources to contribute to the aims of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;
e) to abolish the two existing Statutory Bodies "The Panels of Experts on Ecological, Technical and Development Aspects to the Programme for the Control of African Trypanosomiasis and Related Development" and replace by a single Statutory Body, namely the "Panel of PAAT Advisory Group Coordinators" and to facilitate necessary meetings. This body will be subject to a review after six years.
f) to abolish the Commission on African Animal Trypanosomiasis based on the consideration that the subject may be discussed, as required, by the FAO Regional Conference for Africa.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Activities and programmes of the organization
Programme evaluation report 1996-97
Medium-term plan 1998-2003
Programme evaluation report 1996-97
82. The Conference considered the Programme Evaluation Report 1996-97, and agreed generally with the observations and recommendations of the Council on the Report.
83. The Conference appreciated the improvements introduced to the present Report, which enhanced its analytical content and transparency, including (i) clearer focus on programme objectives and strategy, (ii) inclusion of programme managers' responses to each programme evaluation, and (iii) introduction of summary assessment on the programme performance, based on the criteria suggested by the Council at its Hundred and Tenth Session (Rome, 2-3 November 1995).
84. At the same time, the Conference agreed that further improvements could be made to strengthen the Report's contents, and endorsed the Council's recommendations in this regard. In particular, it highlighted: (i) the need for more systematic analysis of the effect and impact of FAO programmes, (ii) the desirability of using external expertise in programme evaluation, bearing in mind its cost implications, and (iii) further refinements in the criteria used for summary assessment.
85. In this context, the Conference noted the ongoing efforts to improve the design of many FAO programmes, and highlighted the importance of clearer formulation of their objectives, priorities and implementation strategies as well as that of establishing a set of measurable performance targets, milestones and indicators. It also stressed that evaluation should provide effective feedback, especially for cross-cutting issues and lessons, to programme planning and implementation.
86. The Conference agreed with the Council's recommendations with regard to FAO publications, and in particular it decided to delegate to the Council the authority for making the necessary decisions in implementing the proposed change in publication distribution from the quota distribution system to one based on a "national publication account", as recommended in the Report.
87. The Conference endorsed the Programme Evaluation Report 1996-97. At the same time, it highlighted the importance of: (i) full integration of evaluation feedback into the programme planning and management process in the Organization, (ii) ensuring satisfactory coverage of FAO programmes and operations in evaluation work reflecting strategic priorities and (iii) progressive improvements in line with the recommendations of the Programme Committee and the Council.
88. The Conference stressed that a balance between the normative and operational activities of the Organization be maintained and that its core scientific and technical competence be ensured.
Medium-term plan 1998-2003
89. The Conference recalled that the practice of submission to each Conference of a rolling Medium-Term Plan covering a six-year period was instituted through its Resolution 10/89. It noted that the present version of the Plan was the fourth prepared since then.
90. In addressing the substance, the Conference observed that prominence had been given to the outcome of the World Food Summit, highlighting the relationship between substantive priorities and the commitments in the Summit Plan of Action. Many members endorsed the policy orientations and programme priorities highlighted in the document. In particular, they agreed that the indicated priorities reflected the varied requirements of the membership and were consistent with the overall goal of sustainable food security. A number of other members considered that there was an overemphasis on the production-oriented aspects of food security and insufficient attention to the outcomes of other recent international conferences.
91. While agreeing that there were positive elements in the Plan, many members felt that it did not fulfill their expectations from such a policy planning document. In this regard, the Conference addressed the issue of possible improvements to future Medium-Term Plans and the Programme Budget Process in general.
92. The Conference noted the contents of the Report of the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of the Council (Rome, 4-6 November 1997), which in considering the Report of the Seventy-eighth Session of the Programme Committee, had welcomed and endorsed proposals aimed at revising the approach to the Programme Budget Process, including formulation of a long-term Strategic Framework and consequently modified Medium-Term Plan and Programme of Work and Budget. A number of members underlined the importance of enhancing the efficiency and streamlining of FAO's governance in this process.
93. The Conference agreed that a strategic vision of the future work of FAO should be developed. It noted in this connection that a number of key documents were available to support this exercise, including the Summit Plan of Action and prospective studies such as Agriculture Towards 2010 (AT 2010) which was being extended to the year 2015.
94. At the same time, the Conference recognized the general desire of the membership to improve the format and content of the PWB document and to improve the overall Programme Budget Process with a view to more coherence, greater economy, more outcome-orientation and enhanced prioritization of activities through application of the Criteria approved by the Council at its Hundred and Tenth Session. It agreed that proposals for the revision and refinement of these prioritization Criteria would be submitted to the Programme Committee during the development of the new Programme Budget Process.
95. The Conference also recognized the potential impact of the new programming model which was being tested in the Programme of Work and Budget for one selected programme, as this revised model embodied a clear assessment of the objectives sought, identification of beneficiaries in Member Nations, the related time-frames and the outputs and inputs required.
96. The Conference endorsed the relevant recommendations of the Programme Committee and the Council to the effect that:
a) a longer-term Strategic Framework would be formulated for consideration and endorsement by FAO Governing Bodies. This formulation would be based on the application of known strategic planning methodologies and a number of analytical steps;
b) a modified approach would lead to revised Medium-Term Plan and Programme and Budget documents, building on the advantages of the new programming approach illustrated in the PWB document for Programme 2.1.1, Natural Resources.
97. The Conference underlined the importance of an adequate process of intergovernmental discussion to encourage inputs from all interested members and of broad consultation with stakeholders and partners. It recognized that an important initial step in this respect would be the consideration of a first draft of the Strategic Framework by the Spring 1998 sessions of the Programme and Finance Committees, prior to its consideration by the Council at the end of 1998. One group of members stressed that the formulation and development of the Strategic Framework and subsequently a new Medium Term Plan should be intensified and accelerated and should be an intensive and intergovernmental process, which should be established and managed in a way that would encourage the widest possible ownership of the outcome.
98. The Conference also recognized that the full-scale application of the revised process would have implications on the pertinent sections in the Basic Texts of the Organization beyond the amendments undertaken during the Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference.
99. In conclusion, the Conference generally endorsed the present version of the Medium-Term Plan, while noting that it would be the last one based on current arrangements. It looked forward to the impending development of a "Strategic Framework" document in the next biennium, coupled with a modified approach to the formulation of the "Medium-Term Plan" and "Programme of Work and Budget" documents.
100. The Conference agreed that this set of complementary documents should facilitate the task of the Governing Bodies in shaping the course of the Organization in the years ahead.
101. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:
<section>8</section>
VIII. Resolution 6/97
A. Strengthening the FAO 2000 project
B. Programme of work and budget 1998-99
A. Strengthening the FAO 2000 project
THE CONFERENCE,
Reaffirming the commitment in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action to reduce the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015,
Welcoming the proposals by the Director-General to strengthen the strategic management of FAO, especially the formulation of a long term Strategic Framework and consequently modified Medium-Term Plan and Programme of Work and Budget (the FAO 2000 project):
1. Requests the Director-General to further the process leading to the development of a Strategic Vision for the FAO for the years 2000-2015, including inter alia, a set of core strategic objectives and an Implementation Programme;
2. Decides that the process should be, in the framework of existing structures, a full participatory process, involving not only the Secretariat but also the full membership of FAO;
3. Decides further that this process should recognize that a prime responsibility of the CFS is to monitor the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;
4. Requests the Director-General to prepare an appropriate progress report for consideration in the FAO Council in November 1998.
(Adopted on 18 November 1997)
B. Programme of work and budget 1998-99
Approach
General considerations
Substantive priorities
Approach
102. The Conference recalled that the Programme of Work and Budget (PWB) proposals for the biennium 1998-99 had been the object of an extensive process of intergovernmental review, initiated by consideration of the Outline PWB in January by the Programme and Finance Committees, and followed by the subsequent review of the Summary and full PWB documents by all concerned bodies. This process also involved advice on priorities in respective sectors from the Technical Committees of the Council such as COAG, COFI and COFO.
103. The Conference welcomed the improved format of the Programme of Work and Budget, and the depth of information therein. It observed that the format was in accordance with the guidance from the Programme and Finance Committees and the Council. This included the integrated presentation of income, which would henceforth constitute an established feature of the PWB documents. However, some concern was expressed at the length of the document and it was felt that efforts should be made to reduce this.
104. The Conference generally endorsed the revised programming approach as illustrated for one selected programme (2.1.1, Natural Resources) in the PWB document, and invited further testing and refinement to facilitate its wider application to the pertinent programmes of the Organization.
105. The Conference further observed that the PWB document explored two main scenarios, reflecting proposals for zero real growth (ZRG) and zero nominal growth (ZNG), as requested by the Council at its June 1997 session. Additional information on possible reductions if the budget were to be below the zero nominal growth level, were presented in a supplementary document (C 97/3-Sup.2).
106. The Conference noted that the proposals in the document incorporated the impact of the exchange rate, as had also been requested by the Council, based on the use of a provisional rate of Lire 1690 to US$ 1. It further noted that the provision for cost increases, had been the object of the usual detailed scrutiny and had been endorsed by the Finance Committee.
107. The Conference was informed that both scenarios involved the net elimination of posts, while recently-revised estimates of staff redeployment and separation costs associated with these post reductions led to unbudgeted costs of approximately US$ 4 million and US$ 12 million under ZRG and ZNG, respectively.
General considerations
108. The Conference observed that due attention had been paid to maintaining a balance between normative and operational activities. It recalled that the desirability of ensuring such a balance had been consistently underlined by the membership, in view of the importance of both the normative and operational activities of FAO and their mutually-beneficial interactions.
109. The Conference recognized the importance of continued efforts to strengthen the efficiency of FAO activities. It recalled the notable progress made in terms of efficiency savings over the past four years. Many Members underlined that there was a limit to achieving additional savings, lest they would be detrimental to the sound implementation of approved programmes. Other Members considered that FAO should explore further measures in this direction, including administrative streamlining and efficiency improvements, and proposed a significant shift of resources from administrative and financial services to technical and economic programmes.
110. The Conference recalled the importance of the decentralization policy which had been vigorously pursued and had led to considerably strengthened technical capacity at regional and sub-regional levels, complemented by the established FAO country offices. The need for preservation of technical competence at Headquarters was stressed. Many Members illustrated the essential contributions of decentralized offices, particularly of the country offices, to support the work of the Organization and to maintain effective links with countries. Other Members considered that the time was ripe for a careful cost-efficiency evaluation of FAO decentralized offices, with a view to their streamlining, and integration of country offices into UN country representation within the UN Resident Coordinator system, bearing in mind proposals for reform in the United Nations.
111. The Conference agreed with the emphasis put on broadened partnerships and alliances in the PWB proposals. It observed that this was fully consistent with the expectation that FAO play a catalytic and synergetic role in mobilizing and coordinating actions in its domain of competence.
Substantive priorities
112. The Conference recognized the importance of FAO programmes responding to requirements for assistance and the expectations of the membership in the wake of the World Food Summit, as well as to the calls for action stemming from major conferences or international agreements dealing with matters related to FAO's mandate.
113. During the discussion, delegates referred to a wide range of substantive priorities of particular interest to their country or region, such as:
a) sustainable agriculture, including the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, the integrated management of natural resources and integrated management of pests and diseases
b) forestry, including forest resource assessment and the sustainable management of forest resources;
c) fisheries, particularly the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and sustainable aquaculture;
d) other technical, social and economic aspects including human resource development, capacity building/training, technical support, women in development, and support to trade through IPPC and Codex;
e) other food security activities, including FIVIMS (Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System), policy assistance, including programme development and support to follow-up of the Uruguay Round.
114. In recalling the importance of concrete action in the field, the Conference reiterated its support to the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) and the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS).
115. Accordingly, the Conference adopted the following Resolution:

1. Endorses the Programme of Work;
2. Approves a total net appropriation of US$ 650 000 000 for the financial period 1998-99;
(a) Appropriations are voted for the following purposes:
US$
Chapter I - General Policy and Direction 50 359 000
Chapter II - Technical and Economic Programmes 292 906 000
Chapter III - Development Services to Member Nations 118 029 000
Chapter IV - Technical Cooperation Programme 89 447 000
Chapter V - Support Services 57 496 000
Chapter VI - Common Services 41 163 000
Chapter VII - Contingencies 600 000
Total Appropriation (Net) 650 000 000
Chapter VIII - Transfer to Tax Equalization Fund 91 780 000
Total Appropriations (Gross) 741 780 000
(b) The appropriations (gross) voted in paragraph (a) above, shall be financed by assessments on Member Nations, after deduction of Miscellaneous Income in the amount of US$ 11 700 000, thus resulting in assessments against Member Nations of US$ 730 080 000.
(c) In establishing the actual amounts of contributions to be paid by individual Member Nations, the assessment of each Member Nation shall be reduced by any amount standing to its credit in the Tax Equalization Fund provided that the credit of a Member Nation that levies taxes on the salaries, emoluments and indemnities received from FAO by staff members shall be reduced by the estimated amounts of such taxes to be reimbursed to the staff member by FAO. An estimate of US$ 2 500 000 has been withheld for this purpose.
(d) The contributions due from Member Nations in 1998 and 1999 shall be paid in accordance with the scale adopted by the Conference at its Twenty-ninth Session, which contributions, after the deduction of amounts standing to the credit of Member Nations in the Tax Equalization Fund, result in net amounts payable totalling US$ 640 800 000 as set out in Appendix E to this Report.
B. Noting that the Programme of Work and Budget has been approved with zero nominal growth;
Noting further that this budget implies the redeployment or separation of staff members:
1. Authorizes the Director-General to spend up to US$ 12 million for the purposes of meeting redeployment and separation costs over and above the net budgetary appropriations approved above notwithstanding the provisions of Financial Regulation 4.1(a);
2. Invites Members to also contribute voluntarily additional funds for this purpose;
3. Urges all Member Nations to pay their contributions promptly so as to reduce the burden on the accumulated deficit.
(Adopted on 14 November 1997)
B. Constitutional and administrative matters
Amendments to the basic texts of the organization
a) Amendments to Rule XXXIII GRO (committee on World Food security)
116. The Conference endorsed the recommendation of the Council, at its Hundred and Twelfth Session, (Rome, 2-7 June, 1997), that the mandate of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) be amended. In this regard, the Conference noted that Commitment Seven of the Plan of Action adopted by the World Food Summit in November 1996 accorded a substantial role to the CFS in the monitoring of the Implementation of the Action Plan, and that this should be reflected in the mandate of the CFS, as set out in Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization. The Conference further noted that amendments to the mandate of the CFS were required to reflect new responsibilities falling upon FAO as a result of the abolition of the World Food Council by the UN General Assembly, to reflect changes in institutional organizations in the UN system, such as the replacement of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes by the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, and to
rationalize and modernize the terms of reference of the CFS in line with recent practice.
117. Consequently, the Conference adopted the following Resolution:
<section>a</section>
X. Resolution 8/97
A. Amendments to Rule XXXIII of the general rules of the organization (committee on world food security)
Amendments to the general rules of the organization and financial regulations on the programme budget process
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling that Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization establishing the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) and its Terms of Reference was adopted by the Conference at its Eighteenth Session in November 1975 (Resolution 21/75),
Recalling further that Commitment Seven of the Plan of Action adopted by the World Food Summit in November 1996 accorded a substantial role to the CFS in the monitoring of the implementation of the Plan of Action,
Considering that the above-mentioned role should be reflected in the mandate of the CFS as set out in Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization (GRO),
Considering that further changes to the wording of Rule XXXIII GRO are required in order to reflect the new responsibilities falling upon FAO as a result of the abolition of the World Food Council by the UN General Assembly,
Considering also that further amendments are required in order to reflect changes in institutional organization in the UN system, such as the replacement of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes by the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, and to rationalize and modernize the Terms of Reference of the CFS in line with recent practice:
Decides to amend Rule XXXIII of the General Rules of the Organization, Committee on World Food Security, as follows:

17. When establishing subsidiary or ad hoc bodies, the Committee shall define their terms of reference, composition, and, as far as possible, the duration of their mandate. Subsidiary bodies may adopt their own rules of procedure, which shall be consistent with those of the Committee.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
Amendments to the general rules of the organization and financial regulations on the programme budget process
118. The Conference endorsed the recommendation of the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session (Rome, 4-6 November 1997), that the outline Programme of Work and Budget and the joint meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees early in the second year of the biennium be abolished. In this connection, the Conference took note that further amendments to the Basic Texts of the Organization would be required at a subsequent stage, in the light of the outcome of the phased introduction and implementation of a new medium-term planning process on an experimental basis. Meanwhile, the Conference authorized the phased implementation of the new process on a trial basis as approved by the Committees and the Council in due course.
119. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:
<section>b</section>
XI. Resolution 9/97
A. Amendments to the basic texts. Abolition of the outline programme of work and budget and the joint meeting of the programme and finance committees early in the second year of the biennium
Amendments to financial regulations 6.9 and 7.1.
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling that the Council, at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997, requested, on the basis of the recommendations of the Programme and Finance Committees, that options for an adapted medium-term planning process of FAO's activities be examined,
Noting the recommendations of the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session in November 1997, based on the joint recommendation of the Programme and Finance Committees at their Joint Meeting of September 1997, that a new medium-term planning process should be introduced in a flexible and step-by-step manner and that, meanwhile, the Conference should authorize the phased implementation of the medium-term planning process on an experimental basis in the course of the 1998-99 biennium,
Noting the recommendation of the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session in November 1997, that the Basic Texts of the Organization should be amended immediately in order to abolish the outline Programme of Work and Budget and the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committee early in the second year of the biennium to consider that outline,
Realizing that these amendments would be without prejudice to the need for further amendments to be incorporated into the Basic Texts of the Organization, at a subsequent stage and in the light of the outcome of the implementation of a new medium-term planning process on an experimental basis:
Adopts the following amendments to the General Rules of the Organization (GRO) and the Financial Regulations (FR):
a) The word "outline," is deleted before the words "summary and draft Programme of Work and Budget" in the following provisions of the General Rules of the Organization:
i) Rule XXVI, paragraph 7 (a) (ii) (GRO);
ii) Rule XXVIII, paragraph 4 (GRO).
b) Rule XXVIII (GRO) is amended by deleting Paragraph 1 and renumbering the following paragraphs accordingly;
c) Rule XXXVII, paragraph 2 (g) (i) is amended to read as follows:
"(i) in the light of guidance given by the Conference and Council at its previous sessions and by regional and technical conferences, commissions or committees, a summary Programme and Work and Budget for consideration by the Programme and Finance Committees, other appropriate organs of the Organization, and the Council; and ..."
d) Financial Regulation 3.5 is amended to read as follows:
"The Director-General shall arrange for the summary budget to be considered by the Council not less than 90 days before the date fixed for the opening of the regular session of the Conference".
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
Amendments to financial regulations 6.9 and 7.1.
120. The Conference noted that the proposed amendments had been reviewed by the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters (CCLM), at its Sixty-Seventh Session, and endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session (Rome, 4-6 November 1997). The amendments had been prepared in response to the recommendation of the Finance Committee, at its Eighty-Seventh Session, which invited the Secretariat to elaborate detailed proposals for the reformulation of Financial Regulation 6.9 on the Publications Revolving Fund to allow for more flexible utilization of income from the sale of publications and other information materials.

XII. Resolution 10/97
A. Amendment to financial regulations 6.9 and 7.1 (publications revolving fund)
B. Revision of the general regulations of the World Food Programme
A. Amendment to financial regulations 6.9 and 7.1 (publications revolving fund)
THE CONFERENCE,
Noting that the Finance Committee in its consideration of the Programme Evaluation Report at its Eighty-seventh Session invited the Secretariat to prepare detailed proposals for the reformulation of Financial Rule 6.9 to allow more flexible utilization of income from the sale of publication and other information materials,
Noting further that, in recent years, an increasing proportion of income to the Publications Revolving Fund came from sales of electronic publications, or electronic plus print, rather than from printed publications,
Considering that allowing some portion of the income generated through the publications activities to be credited to the originating departments would constitute an incentive to make publishing activities more cost-effective,
Considering further that sufficient funds should be carried over, at the end of each financial period, to the next biennium, in order to allow forward planning of sales and marketing activities and continuity of staffing:
Decides to amend Financial Regulations 6.9 and 7.1 as follows:
FINANCIAL REGULATION 6.9
6.9 There shall be established an Information Products Revolving Fund to which shall be credited the proceeds of sales of information products and the revenue from advertising in and sponsorship of such products, except that where extra-budgetary funds are used to finance those information products, the proceeds of sales may be credited to such funds. The Fund shall be used only for the following purposes: (i) to meet the direct costs of reproducing those information products for the sale of which there is a demand or producing new information products; (ii) to pay, from within the resources available to the Fund, the direct costs, including costs of human resources and equipment, not covered by the Programme of Work and Budget, required for the sale and marketing of all such information products; and (iii) to credit the originating divisions with such proportion of the proceeds credited to the Fund, up to 20 percent thereof, as may be determined by the Director-General, to
be utilized within the biennium in which it is credited. Any balance at the end of each financial period in excess of such sums as may be approved by the Finance Committee to cover commitments in respect of expenditures proposed by the Director-General for the following biennium shall be transferred to Miscellaneous Income.
FINANCIAL REGULATION 7.1
7.1 Contributions from Associate Members and all receipts other than:
a) contributions from Member Nations to the budget;
b) direct refunds of expenditures made during the financial period;
c) advances by Member Nations to the Working Capital Fund or deposits to Trust and Special Funds and other receipts directly related to those funds; and
d) proceeds of sales of information products and the revenue from advertising in and sponsorship of such products shall be classed as Miscellaneous Income, for credit to the General Fund. Interest or other income derived from any Trust or Special Fund accepted by the Organization shall be credited to the fund to which it relates, unless provided for otherwise by the terms of the applicable Trust or Special Fund agreement.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Revision of the general regulations of the World Food Programme
122. The Conference noted that the amendments to the General Regulations of WFP had been prepared by an Open-ended Working Group and approved by the Executive Board of WFP in April 1997. The amendments had been endorsed by the FAO Council, at its Hundred and Twelfth Session (Rome, 2-7 June 1997), and by the Economic and Social Council through its decision No. 1997/217 of 8 July 1997. Parallel resolutions approving the amendments were now before both the United Nations General Assembly and the FAO Conference.
123. The Conference noted that the present revision represented a substantial restructuring of the General Regulations of WFP. The major constitutional and policy directives were now set out in the General Regulations. Matters of a policy nature, which did not affect the constitutional status of the WFP and which might need to be changed from time to time were now set out in General Rules which could be amended by the WFP Executive Board. Some matters, more relevant to the financial operations of the Programme had also been moved from the General Regulations to the Financial Rules also to be adopted by the Executive Board.
124. The Conference expressed satisfaction at the quality of the work accomplished.
125. Consequently, the Conference approved the following Resolution:
<section>d</section>
XIII. Resolution 11/97
A. Revision of the general regulations of the World Food Programme
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling its Resolutions 1/61, 4/65 and 22/75 concerning the establishment and continuation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, of the United Nations World Food Programme, its Resolution 9/91 concerning the revision of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme and membership of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes of the World Food Programme, and its Resolution 9/95 transforming the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes into an Executive Board of the World Food Programme and approving revised General Regulations for the World Food Programme,
Noting Resolution 48/162 adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 December 1993, on further measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields,
Having considered the decision of the Hundred and Twelfth Session of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, adopted on the recommendation of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, concerning the revision of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme:
1. Decides to approve the revised General Regulations of the World Food Programme contained in Appendix F as endorsed by the FAO Council at the ninth meeting of its Hundred and Twelfth Session on 7 June 1997, and by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in its decision N. 1997/217 of 8 July 1997;
2. Decides further, subject to the concurrence of the General Assembly of the United Nations, that the revised General Regulations shall enter into force on 1 January 1998.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Revision of the international plant protection convention
126. The Conference noted that the proposed revision of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) was comprehensive and wide ranging. Its objective was to bring the Convention up to date with modem phytosanitary practices and technologies, to bring it into line with the new concepts introduced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (the SPS Agreement), and to establish a mechanism, the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures, for the formal setting of phytosanitary standards, which would be recognized under the SPS Agreement, as well as establishing formally the IPPC Secretariat.
127. The Conference noted that, at its Twenty-eighth Session (Rome, 20-31 October 1995), it had called for the revision of the IPPC on the recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture. Subsequently, the text was negotiated over a period of two years. The Council had unanimously endorsed the revised text, at its Hundred and Twelfth Session, (Rome, 2-7 June 1997), and had recommended that it be transmitted through the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters (CCLM) and the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session (Rome, 4-6 November 1997), to the Conference for adoption.
128. The Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session, approved the recommendations of the CCLM and agreed to transmit the amendments to the IPPC as modified by the CCLM, to the Conference for its consideration and approval.
129. The Conference took note of the statement of the Chairman of the WTO SPS Committee indicating that the SPS Committee and the SPS Secretariat had closely followed the revision of the Convention and had supported its results. The IPPC was distinct from the SPS Agreement and had its own scope and objectives, although with a common interest in the application of phytosanitary measures affecting trade. The revision was consistent with the SPS Agreement which included wild flora and forests in its definition of plants, thus allowing the use of phytosanitary measures to safeguard commercial, as well as non-commercial, plants. The adoption and implementation of the revised IPPC would be of great assistance in the application of the WTO SPS principles and objectives.
130. The Conference took note that the international standards for phytosanitary measures as adopted by the FAO Conference and, in future, by the Interim Commission and, once the revised IPPC enters into force, by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures, would constitute international phytosanitary standards referred to in Article 3, paragraph 2 of the SPS Agreement.
131. The Conference agreed that the Secretariat of the IPPC should commence work on further standards that would include topics not covered by the current IPPC but that would become relevant under the revised text and that such standards would be considered for adoption by the Interim Commission.
132. The Conference took particular note of the views of the CCLM as to whether the amendments would involve new obligations for the contracting parties. In this connection, the Conference decided that the amendments would not involve new obligations for contracting parties. Consequently, once adopted, the amendments would come into force, for all contracting parties, after acceptance by two-thirds of the Contracting Parties.
133. The Conference commended the FAO Secretariat on the work accomplished and approved the amendments to the IPPC as reflected in the revised text of the Convention set out in Appendix G.
134. The Conference adopted the following explanatory statement: "With reference to Article III of this Convention, nothing in this Convention, and in particular in Articles VI or VII thereof, shall be interpreted as limiting the rights or the obligations of the contracting parties to this Convention under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement).
135. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:

THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling its approval of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution at its Sixth Session in 1951, which Convention came into force on 3 April 1952,
Recalling its adoption of amendments to the Convention at its Twentieth Session in November 1979 by Resolution 14/79, which amendments came into force on 4 April 1991,
Being convinced of the continued need to protect plant life or health from the spread and introduction of pests,
Noting the agreements reached as a result of the Uruguay Round of Trade Negotiations and the references in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to the International Plant Protection Convention and international standards guidelines and recommendations developed for connection therewith,
Taking into account the need for the development of International Phytosanitary Standards to protect plant health without creating unnecessary impediments to the international transportation of plants, plant products and other articles deemed to require phytosanitary measures,
Recalling the agreement reached at its Twenty-fifth Session in November 1989 on the necessity of establishing a Secretariat within FAO for the International Plant Protection Convention,
Recalling that at its Twenty-seventh Session in November 1993, as an interim measure, it agreed to authorize the Director-General to establish the Committee on Phytosanitary Measures under Article VI.2 of the Constitution, and to establish the procedure that could be followed for the setting of harmonized international standards and guidelines,
Having considered the work of the Expert Consultation on the Revision of the IPPC held in April 1996, the Technical Consultation on the Revision of the IPPC held in January 1997, the Fourteenth Session of the Committee on Agriculture in April 1997 and the Hundred and Twelfth Session of the Council in June 1997,
Taking note of the recommendations contained in the report of the African Expert Consultation on the IPPC held in June 1997,
Having examined the text of the draft amendments to the IPPC endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997,
Having considered the observations contained in the Report of the Sixty-seventh Session of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters held in October 1997 and the Report of the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of Council,
Stressing that it is in the interest of the international community that the proposed amendments should enter into force without delay,
Noting that, in accordance with Article XII.4 of the Convention, the amendments will enter into force as from the thirtieth day after acceptance by two thirds of the contracting parties:
1. Approves the amendments to the International Plant Protection Convention set out in the Revised Text contained in Appendix G;
2. Takes note of the agreed interpretation contained in Appendix I;
3. Bequests the Director-General to transmit the revised text incorporating the amendments to the Contracting Parties for their consideration with a view to their acceptance of the amendments;
4. Urges the Contracting parties to accept the amendments as early as possible;
5. Urges FAO Members and Non-Member States that have not yet done so to adhere to the Convention as early as possible;
6. Notes the specific need of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, for technical assistance in order to enhance their capacity to fulfill their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate its implementation;
7. Urges that high priority be given to the provision of reports on the occurrence, outbreak and spread of pests to the Secretary of the IPPC and, underlines the importance of establishing relevant procedures applicable to this reporting;
8. Agrees to the establishment of an Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures under Article VI. 1 of the FAO Constitution with the Terms of Reference contained in Appendix H;
9. Agrees that the present Secretariat to the IPPC shall continue until the amendments come into force and until then shall provide secretariat services to the Interim Commission;
10. Agrees that the present standard-setting procedure shall continue until the amendments come into force, or until the interim Commission decides otherwise, except that phytosanitary standards will be considered and adopted by the Interim Commission instead of by the Committee on Agriculture, Council and/or the Conference;
11. Agrees that the Secretariat to the IPPC commence work on International Standards for non quarantine regulated pests;
12. Allows the use of the amended phytosanitary certificate as an alternative on voluntary basis among Parties that accept it; and
13. Requests Parties to nominate an official contact point, and to communicate its nomination to the Secretariat.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Cooperation agreement between FAO and the regional centre on agrarian reform and rural development for the near east (CARDNE)
136. The Conference expressed its satisfaction with the strengthening of the cooperation between the Regional Centre on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development for the Near East (CARDNE) and FAO.

143. The Conference approved the preambular and the operative paragraphs of the Draft Conference Resolution.
144. The Conference agreed to approve Annex A of the Draft Resolution for the Conference. One Member suggested that the Commission on Fertilizers (FERT) listed therein for abolition, be replaced by a new Commission on Plant Nutrients instead, but the Conference noted that such a proposal should be considered by the Committee on Agriculture (COAG).
145. The Conference agreed that the ECA Working Party on Women and Agricultural Family in Rural Development should be deleted from Annex B.

XV. Resolution 13/97
A. Review of FAO statutory bodies
B. Audited accounts
A. Review of FAO statutory bodies
THE CONFERENCE,
Conscious of the continuing need to enhance the efficiency of the Organization and its governance in a time of financial challenge, to eliminate Statutory Bodies that are obsolete, to ensure more flexible task-oriented and time-bound working arrangements for those that remain and to limit the creation of new Bodies to those that are strictly necessary,
Recognising the importance of moving towards increased self-financing for Statutory Bodies that have regional focus, and of enhancing the responsiveness of those bodies to the needs of their Members:
1. Decides to abolish the Bodies listed in Annex A to this Resolution;
2. Recommends to the parent Bodies concerned that their Subsidiary Bodies listed in Annex B be abolished and calls on those parent Bodies to take the necessary action unless they consider, taking into account the financial and programme implications, that there are overriding reasons for retaining any such Bodies in existence and to report to the Council through the Programme and Finance Committees on the actions taken and, where appropriate, on the reasons for retaining any of the Subsidiary Bodies recommended for abolition;
3. Requests the Director-General to consult with the organizations listed in Annex C with a view to securing alternative arrangements for, or the abolition of, the joint Bodies listed in that Annex as deemed appropriate and authorises their abolition, as appropriate;
4. Recommends to the Codex Alimentarius Commission that it continue its review of the usefulness of its Subsidiary Bodies set out in Annex D;
5. Encourages regional commissions established under Article VI of the Constitution to seek more extra-budgetary resources to supplement the resources made available to them under the FAO Regular Programme Budget, taking into account the economic capacity of the regions concerned and of their Members;
6. Calls on the Contracting Parties to Conventions and Agreements establishing regional bodies under Article XIV of the Constitution to seek where appropriate, increasingly to provide such Bodies with their own financial resources, whether through cooperative programmes or other voluntary contributions, or through the establishment of autonomous budgets financed from mandatory contributions;
7. Decides that in future, Statutory Bodies should be established only where strictly necessary and where the work to be undertaken cannot be carried out by ad hoc groups, and that the Terms of Reference of all new Bodies created should provide for a periodic review of their usefulness;
8. Further decides that, to this end, the following factors should be taken into account in establishing new technical Bodies and in the establishment of new Subsidiary Bodies
a) Centrality to the FAO mandate and the Organization's current priorities as expressed by FAO Members and reflected in planning documents;
b) Clarity of the definition of the task, which should normally be of limited duration;
c) Positive impact of the Body's work at the level of FAO Members;
d) FAO's comparative advantage, thereby avoiding overlap and creating synergy with the work of other Bodies;
e) Proportion of the FAO Membership to which the work of the proposed body is of importance with due regard to the economic capacity of less-advantaged members, including least developed countries and small-island developing states;
f) Willingness of their Members to contribute financially and through non-monetary inputs to the work of the Body, especially where the Body will serve a more limited number of countries, with due regard to the economic capacity of their less advantaged members and the availability of other financial support;
9. Requests all Statutory Bodies to examine how their Rules of Procedure and working methods could be streamlined to facilitate positive inter-action among participants at meetings, to promote a task-orientation and to strengthen the involvement of civil-society partners;
10. Further requests the Secretariat to prepare information notes to facilitate review by the Council, following discussion in the Programme and Finance Committees, of (a) possibilities for streamlining procedures and avoiding repetitious discussion in Bodies at various levels, taking full account of the experience of other international organizations; and (b) modalities for greater civil society involvement;
11. Decides that, in general, Executive Committees should cease to be listed as formal Statutory Bodies in the Directory of FAO Statutory Bodies, except for the Executive Committee of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

XVI. Resolution 14/97
A. FAO audited accounts 1994-95
B. Scale of contributions 1998-99
A. FAO audited accounts 1994-95
THE CONFERENCE,
Considering the report of the Hundred and Eleventh Session of the Council,
Having examined the FAO Audited Accounts 1994-95 and the External Auditor's Report thereon,
Adopts the Audited Accounts.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Scale of contributions 1998-99
150. The Conference noted that it had been the normal practice of the Organization to derive the Scale of Contributions for the following biennium directly from the UN Scale of Assessments in force during the calendar year of the Conference Session. In 1995, however, the Conference had adopted a Scale of Contributions for the biennium 1996-97 derived from the UN Scale of Assessments in force for the corresponding years, in view of substantial changes in the UN Scale of Assessments for the biennium 1996-97. This was possible since the UN Scale of Assessments for the three-year period 1995 to 1997 was then in force, having been adopted in December 1994.
151. The Conference further noted that substantial changes to the UN Scale of Assessments for the period 1998 to 2000 were now under discussion by the United Nations General Assembly. The outcome of the discussions however would not be known before the end of the Conference. One Member Nation expressed reservations on the proposed draft Resolution in particular with regard to its admissibility from a legal point of view.
152. The Conference adopted the following Resolution:

THE CONFERENCE,
Having noted the recommendations of the Hundred and Twelfth and Hundred and Thirteenth Sessions of the Council,
Confirming that, as in the past, FAO should follow the United Nations Scale of Assessments subject to adaptation for the different membership of FAO,
Noting that the United Nations General Assembly has not yet reached agreement on the United Nations Scale of Assessments to be applied for the years 1998-2000:
1. Adopts for use in 1998 and 1999 the Scale as set out in Appendix M of this Report, derived directly from the United Nations Scale of Assessments in force during 1997;
2. Decides that if the United Nations General Assembly, adopts a new United Nations Scale of Assessments for the years 1998 to 2000 before 31 December 1998, the Director-General shall prepare a modified Scale of Contributions for the year 1999 to reflect the Scale of Assessments for that year fixed by the United Nations General Assembly applying established principles for adjusting the FAO Scale of Assessment to take into account differences in membership between the United Nations and FAO.
(Adopted on 14 November 1997)
B. Payment by the European Community to cover expenses arising out of its membership in the organization
153. The Conference decided that the lump-sum payment due by the European Community (EC) to cover expenses arising out of its membership in the Organization be set at US$545 500 for the 1998-99 biennium.
154. As for the 1996-97 biennium, the Conference also decided that the sums paid by the EC in respect of such administrative and other expenses should be paid into a Trust or Special Fund to be established by the Director-General under Regulation 6.7 of the Financial Regulations.
C. Financial position of the organization including status of contributions
155. The Conference reviewed the status of collection of contributions at 12 November 1997 noting that nearly US$ 257 million of regular contributions had been received and that 75.12 percent of current assessments had been paid.

D. Approval of the commissary accounts by the finance committee
156. The Conference considered the proposal made by the Director-General, and supported by the Council at its Hundred and Eleventh Session (Rome, 1-10 October 1996) and adopted the following Resolution:

XVIII. Resolution 16/97
A. Staff commissary accounts
B. Incentive scheme to encourage the prompt payment of contributions

D. Appointments and elections
A. Staff commissary accounts
THE CONFERENCE,
Having noted that the accounts of the Commissary have been regularly brought to the attention of, and reviewed by, the Finance Committee without being formally approved by that Committee,
Recognizing that approval by the Conference every two years, while the Commissary Accounts are produced annually as of 31 December, would lead to unacceptable delays in approval:
Decides that, with effect from 1 January 1998, the annual accounts of the Commissary be submitted to and approved by the Finance Committee.
(Adopted on 17 November 1997)
B. Incentive scheme to encourage the prompt payment of contributions
157. The Conference considered the proposals of the Director-General to introduce a further refinement in the calculation of the discount to be applied to Member Nations' contributions under the Incentive Scheme. One Member Nation, speaking on behalf of 15 Members, expressed non-concurrence to the proposal, but indicated that, while maintaining their position, they would join a consensus on this matter. The Conference, consequently, approved the proposed refinement and agreed that it should be applied with effect from 1 January 1998.
C. Address by staff representative bodies
158. The Representative of the Field Staff Association (FSA), on behalf of the three Staff Representative Bodies, addressed the Conference, highlighting the concerns of the staff regarding the continuing budgetary problems of the Organization, and stressed the need for the Organization to be given the necessary resources to adequately meet the challenges and needs of agricultural and rural development in order to address world famine and poverty and meet the targets defined in the World Food Summit.

159. The Conference had before it an application for membership from the Republic of Kazakhstan. This application had been submitted within the time limit prescribed by Rule XIX GRO.

160. The Conference proceeded to a secret ballot on the application at its second plenary meeting on Friday, 7 November 1997, in accordance with Article II-2 of the Constitution and Rule XII-9 GRO. The result was as follows:

XXIV. Appendix D. Statement by the director-general
Mr Chairman of the Conference,
Mr Independent Chairman of the Council,
Distinguished Ministers,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Just one year ago, the World Food Summit was being held in this very hall. I do not need to emphasize the importance of that event for implementation of the Organization's mandate and I should like once again to pay tribute to all those who helped make the Summit a great success: the governments, the parliamentarians, the representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the private sector, and the staff of FAO.
Now, with determination, tenacity and coherence, we have actually to put into practice the commitments that were adopted by 186 countries. It is in this perspective that the proceedings of this Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference should take place.
(State of world food and agriculture)
The state of world food and agriculture is one of contrasts. The acute pressures on the food commodity markets of 1995-96 have largely been absorbed with the good harvests of 1996. Yet, many countries still face difficulties, and early estimates for 1997 point to an increase in world agricultural output of only 1.1 percent. Moreover, cereal stocks - estimated to be 285 million tonnes or just over 15 percent of expected consumption in 1997/98 - have not resumed to the standard security threshold of 17 to 18 percent of annual needs. The high cost of food imports has caused serious problems for many low-income food-deficit countries and has slowed their progress towards food security.
While the global outlook is good, with world economic growth for 1997 and 1998 expected to be about 4.2 percent against 4.1 percent in 1996, the situation in many parts of the world is not so reassuring. Several developing countries, crushed by an external debt burden totalling US$2.177 billion in December 1996, are increasingly at risk of becoming marginalized. Many are struggling to create an environment conducive to foreign investment and to improve their competitiveness fast enough to keep up with the advance of free trade and globalization. Development aid continues to decline in real terms, having hovered at a nominal US$60 billion in recent years. At the same time, aid to the agricultural sector plunged from US$16 billion in 1988 to US$10 billion in 1995, although there are now welcome signs of a change in direction. The gap between rich and poor can only widen under such conditions, both within and between countries.
Furthermore, armed conflicts and food emergencies continue, the one very often abetting the other. Peace may be a prerequisite for food security, but there can be no peaceful life for populations affected by hunger.
(Implementation of the Summit Plan of Action)
A series of initiatives have been launched to pursue the objectives of the World Food Summit:
The drafting of documents on national strategies for agriculture and food security towards the year 2010, with 150 developing Member Nations and others in transition, provides a framework for FAO collaboration with these countries. I wish that the developed Member Nations could also join this exercise and prepare similar documents in a spirit of global approach to the problems of food security.
The development of the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System started early this year in close collaboration with many UN agencies and international and national institutions working in this field. The Expert Consultation organized by FAO last March determined the actions that were needed to launch this programme. These were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security in April 1997, and an interagency working group has been formed for their implementation.
However, actually halving the total of 800 million people without adequate access to food by the year 2015 calls for more than speeches, seminars, studies and consultants' reports. Concrete field actions have therefore been conducted, spearheaded by the Special Programme for Food Security which targets rural communities in poor countries. The programme is already operational in 24 of these countries and formulation is under way in a further 42. The modest funds earmarked in the Organization's Regular Programme have had a catalytic effect in mustering bilateral and multilateral resources that will enable this vital programme to grow and reach all 86 low-income food-deficit countries.
Meanwhile, the Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases has already scored notable successes: timely interventions in emergency situations, for example, rinderpest in five countries and desert locust control in regions most exposed to this scourge, North Africa, the Sahel and the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region. There are plans to build a world network of national units and to strengthen capacity for rapid intervention and assistance to countries for the elimination of animal diseases and the control of plant diseases.
FAO has also stepped up its normative and operational support to Member Nations for implementation of the Marrakesh Agreement. This assistance, provided by means of 18 regional workshops and 44 national projects, has focused on agricultural policy, the prospects opened up by the "Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed Countries and Net Food-Importing Countries", intellectual property rights, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade and the international standards of the Codex Alimentarius, whose Joint FAO/WHO Commission now has 158 members. The Organization will, however, have to raise its capacity to help prepare future trade negotiations, working closely with WTO, the World Bank and UNCTAD.
The Summit placed great emphasis on the need to involve civil society in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. FAO has therefore encouraged the launching of "Food for All" campaigns and a process of national consultation to this effect is already under way in several developed and developing countries. I should like to reiterate my appeal to all governments to launch these campaigns, for example by establishing fore that will group all development players and partners (parliamentarians, NGOs, the private sector, women's associations, youth organizations, the media, universities, and so forth). It was this concern to engage world public opinion that led to "TeleFood", which was organized to mark World Food Day and which, through 100 or so television channels, brought home the problems of hunger and malnutrition to approximately 500 million viewers in more than 70 countries.
Under the auspices of the UN Administrative Committee on Co-ordination, an interagency cooperation mechanism has been put in place for implementing the Summit Plan of Action, including the establishment of a Network on Rural Development and Food Security, as proposed by FAO and IFAD.
Finally, FAO has introduced a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the Summit Plan of Action, following the indications of the Committee on World Food Security which will evaluate progress at its next session.
(Other achievements)
Mr Chairman,
FAO has pursued and intensified its efforts to implement the programme of reform that was adopted by the Council at its 106th Session in June 1994 regarding the policies, priorities and structures of the Organization. It has also undertaken actions in other important spheres of its mandate.
First, initiatives for the sustainable use of natural resources have led to:
- the adoption of the World Plan of Action of the International Technical Conference for the Conservation and Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources, held in Leipzig in June 1 996;
- the revision of the International Plant Protection Convention;
- the Programme for Integrated Pest Control, successfully applied in Asia and under implementation in Africa.
Next, forests, where FAO has continued to develop a programme focusing on the contribution of forestry to food security, on effective and responsible forest management and on maintaining an equilibrium among the economic, ecological and social benefits of forest resources. It has also helped develop national forestry programmes, drawing up a blueprint for the planning of sustainable development of all types of forest and forest activities. During these last two years, FAO has made a substantial contribution to the international debate on forestry issues, and has played its expected lead role, to the full, supporting the works of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests and chairing the Inter Agency Task Force on Forests, which has prepared a plan of work to implement the Panel's decisions. In addition, less than a month ago, the Eleventh World Forestry Congress was held in Antalya at the invitation of Turkey and with the support of the Organization.
Finally, fisheries and aquaculture, where FAO's work has continued within the framework of the Kyoto Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and reinforcement of regional bodies, in particular the recently formed Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean. Since the last Conference, 21 technical consultations on the management of marine fishery resources have been held in the framework of regional bodies. In addition, work on aquatic genetic resources has been stepped up and studies have been carried out on the impact of "EI Niño" on fisheries in Latin America and Africa.
(Processing, analysis and dissemination of information)
The compilation, analysis and dissemination of information in all these spheres remains one of FAO's most important activities. Its annual report on the state of food and agriculture continues to be the main source of general information in this area and now includes a section on food security as follow up to the Summit. Two new publications have also been introduced to provide an in-depth analysis of the state and specific problems of fisheries and forestry: The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture and State of the World's Forests. The Sixth World Food Survey was published in 1996, including China and the Central Asian countries in transition for the first time, employing a more sophisticated methodology and providing more detailed anthropometric information.
FAO continues to serve as a reference for the long-term outlook for agriculture and food security. Following publication in 1993 of its study World agriculture: towards 2010, there will soon be an update covering likely developments towards 2015, with a more general evaluation leading up to 2030.
(Modern information and telecommunication techniques)
In recent years, the Organization has formulated and implemented strategies and plans for the effective use of modern information and telecommunication technologies. The supply or replacement of equipment, software and applications, the improved flow of information through the Intranet and Internet and the introduction of multimedia resources have helped rationalize and modernize systems while reducing costs. The Organization now uses video-conferencing to replace the traditional interagency meetings and consultations.
Information dissemination has therefore kept pace with the times through these electronic facilities. The World Agricultural Information Centre (WAlCENT) now enables governments, institutions and the general public to have ready access to a wide range of information that is essential for food security and sustainable rural development: FAOSTAT for statistical data, FAOINFO for textual information and FAOSIS for access to specialized information systems, in particular, animal genetic resources and pesticides. Three different modes of access have been set up for the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture.
These efforts are producing results. FAO's site on the Internet is posting more than one million hits each month and has reinforced as never before the Organization's capacity to disseminate information to English-, Arabic-, Spanish- and French-speaking users. At the same time, 2000 CD-ROMs have been distributed to all Member Nations to provide access to WAICENT in areas where the Internet is not easily or widely available. The Programme of Work and Budget for 1998-99 will further expand information services to Member Nations. More specifically, a series of FAO technical documents will be made available on the Internet and CD-ROM, and Member Nations will be helped to draw maximum benefit from the Organization's wealth of documentation.
(Grassroots participation and the role of women)
Mr Chairman,
FAO attaches great importance to all members of society being fully involved in the common objective of achieving "Food for All", and actions that promote the role of women receive priority attention in this strong focus on participation in all FAO programmes and activities. Within the Secretariat, the Committee on Women in Development is successfully encouraging all FAO technical departments to bear gender parity in mind when formulating their programmes and projects. A detailed study was published on the occasion of World Rural Women's Day in October 1997 to raise awareness of the important role of women in food security. As regards training, the Socioeconomic and Gender Analysis Programme, implemented since June 1996, has affected almost 2 000 experts in 60 countries. Furthermore, the activities carried out under the Special Programme for Food Security will improve rural women's access to technologies, inputs and credit, with a special emphasis on poultry raising and
market gardening which are generally within the ambit of women's activities.
Youth also needs to be mobilized and, as a first step, a network of government institutions responsible for rural youth programmes in 15 English-speaking African countries has been set up to foster the contribution of young people to food security and sustainable development. This exercise will soon be extended to other countries.
(Partnerships)
Mr Chairman,
The Organization has also been energetically exploring partnership and coordination possibilities:
- with the World Bank and regional banks through new agreements, especially for implementation of the Special Programme for Food Security;
- with the food and agriculture institutions based in Rome, IFAD and WFP, thanks to regular and more frequent contact at all levels;
- with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, its Technical Advisory Committee and its institutes;
- with the other UN agencies under the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination;
- with the private sector and the community of non-governmental organizations.
Similarly, various forms of cooperation are being developed with many Member Nations: over the last three years, some 750 experts have been involved in implementing FAO programmes within the framework of the agreements for cooperation between developing countries and countries in transition; some 150 researchers have participated in the Programme of Cooperation with Academic and Research Institutions, and over 400 experts have been employed under the Retiree Programme. While maintaining quality performance, these agreements offer considerable savings against the cost of international consultants. Furthermorere, in support of the Special Programme for Food Security, a number of South-South cooperation agreements have resulted in the more advanced developing countries providing a critical mass of field technicians in rural communities of other developing countries, with support from the Organization. Finally, to increase national capacities, FAO has conducted a survey of
training opportunities offered in the areas of its mandate by Member Nations for students and trainees from developing countries. Along the same lines, FAO will employ young professionals, within the limit of available resources, so that they can gain practical experience and thus build on their high level academic training.
(Investment)
The promotion of investment in agriculture, the theme of this year's World Food Day, is another major thrust of FAO activity. The Investment Centre has worked with the funding agencies to prepare investment projects for a total value of US$6 billion in 199596, including 3.5 billion from external funds. Activities undertaken in 1997 could lead to the mobilization a total of US$2.5 billion.
FAO's Technical Cooperation Programme continues to be a strong catalyst. Since January 1996, upon the request of the Member Nations, 350 new projects have been initiated in areas requiring preliminary, urgent or unforeseen action. The programme continues to abide by its criteria of rapid approval, limited duration, low cost and practical orientation.
Cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme is now on an upturn the sharp downward trend of recent years. FAO's role in implementing UNDP-funded projects has been strengthened, with US$40 million of new funds approved in the first nine months of 1997 - already more than for the whole of last year.
(Restructuring and decentralization)
Mr Chairman,
The restructuring of FAO has been pursued during the course of this biennium with determination and with the same overriding objectives of identifying savings and improving efficiency through decentralization. This effort has, however, had to be made under severe budgetary limitations.
- The decentralization process will be completed in December of this year: all the new liaison and sub-regional offices are open; the regional offices have been reinforced; the last operations teams are being transferred; and, in 1998-99, Member Nation coverage by the network of FAO Representatives should be improved through the use of multiple accreditation, National Programme Officers and National Correspondents. The measures taken since 1994 to improve the cost-effectiveness of country offices will be continued. In January 1998, 31 percent of the posts in the Professional and Director category and 38 percent of the total establishments will be working in the decentralized offices. The decentralization of policy assistance and project operations will make FAO better attuned to the needs of its members and their rural communities in the different geographic regions.
- Staff numbers have been further reduced, with the elimination of 503 posts, or 12 percent, since January 1994 when there were 4 185 posts to the proposed 3 682 in January 1998. At the same time only seven professional posts have been abolished. The grades pyramid has been broadened, with the elimination of 37 directors' posts, a reduction of 15.6 percent. Transparency and consultation with staff representatives, to whom I take this opportunity to pay tribute, have minimized the human cost. At the same time, greater attention has been paid to staff training, to raising the contingent of women professional staff and to ensuring equitable Member Nation representation among the staff. The number of countries not represented among the staff has fallen from 54 in January 1994 to 31 in October 1997, taking into account ongoing recruitment. While staff numbers have been reduced, annual savings of US$25 million have also been made from cuts in travel, translations, publications
and meetings.
(Administrative and financial reform)
The restructuring process has been echoed in the administration and finance sectors. Operational, administrative and financial responsibilities have been delegated to departments at Headquarters and teams in the field. This is reflected in the Management Support Units that have been set up at the departmental and regional office level. At the same time there has been tighter auditing in all regional, sub-regional and country offices.
FAO has also sought to simplify its administrative and financial procedures and has set about replacing the computerized financial and personnel management system with the more up-to-date Oracle system.
As regards planning, the programming and coordination methods have been revised and the Medium-term Plan improved. In addition, programming by objectives is now under trial for the Programme of Work and Budget.
(The Programme of Work and Budget)
The Programme of Work and Budget for 1998-99 is the result of careful in-house analysis and delicate protracted consultation with the Member Nations. The implications of the different budget options on the programmes have been examined in accordance with the guidelines of the Council and its Technical Committees. The Programme of Work and Budget submitted to the Conference therefore combines two scenarios, as requested by the Council: the proposals associated with a zero real growth scenario, presented in detail for a total budget of US$675.3 million, and the changes that would be needed to accommodate zero nominal growth and therefore a budget of US$650 million. A brief supplementary document has also been issued, outlining the reductions that would be needed for a budget below zero nominal growth. It is worth recalling, in this connection, that the approved budget for 1994-95 was US$673 million.
The zero real growth scenario would enable the Organization to maintain its capacity in priority areas. First, its normative work, including the International Plant Protection Convention, the Code of Conduct on Pesticides, Codex Alimentarius, the conservation and management of genetic resources, responsible fisheries and the evaluation of forest resources. Second, its technical assistance provided to Member Nations at their own request, such as in the implementation of the Marrakesh Agreement, development of non-polluting aquaculture, conservation and management of forests, control of pests and diseases, early warning of food shortages and the role of women in rural development. Finally, the zero real growth scenario would enable FAO to maintain its direct support to countries in the form of policy advice, and help with implementation of the Summit Plan of Action, investment support and field operations, particularly the Special Programme for Food Security.
With the zero nominal growth option, however, and despite all efforts to the contrary, only some of these priority areas could be maintained: forestry, Codex, TCP and the Special Programme.
Clearly - and this needs to be emphasized - the negative impact of a below zero nominal growth budget on programmes of high priority to Member Nations would obviously be aggravated.
Having outlined the budget proposals, I feel that I must also throw in some telling comparisons:
FAO's budget is equal to little more than two days' tobacco consumption in North
America and less than two months' champagne consumption in one European country.
Where, then, does the fight against the hunger of 800 million human beings fit in the scale of priorities of the affluent?
(Conclusion)
Mr Chairman, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
As Director-General dedicated to the objectives of your Organization, I am both encouraged by the unparalleled mobilization generated by the World Food Summit and, at the same time, anxious that FAO should maintain its capacity to achieve the objectives that you have set for it, particularly in the Rome Declaration and World Food Summit Plan of Action.
I am convinced that the primary responsibility in this undertaking lies with the Member Nations and that it is the role of FAO to provide the services and support they require. I can only report the magnitude of expressed needs to world leaders and international opinion. As for my part, I shall continue to do all I can to ensure that the resources at my disposal are used with utmost regard to economy, effectiveness and transparency. I should like to believe that your decisions will ensure that FAO is in a position to meet the immense pressing needs that the Summit brought to light and satisfy the legitimate expectations it raised among the more vulnerable and impoverished members of our global village. Thank you.

c) Contracting parties shall, on request, make available to any contracting party the rationale for phytosanitary requirements, restrictions and prohibitions.
d) If a contracting party requires consignments of particular plants or plant products to be imported only through specified points of entry, such points shall be so selected as not to unnecessarily impede international trade. The contracting party shall publish a list of such points of entry and communicate it to the Secretary, any regional plant protection organization of which the contracting party is a member, all contracting parties which the contracting party believes to be directly affected, and other contracting parties upon request. Such restrictions on points of entry shall not be made unless the plants, plant products or other regulated articles concerned are required to be accompanied by phytosanitary certificates or to be submitted to inspection or treatment.
e) Any inspection or other phytosanitary procedure required by the plant protection organization of a contracting party for a consignment of plants, plant products or other regulated articles offered for importation, shall take place as promptly as possible with due regard to their perishability.
f) Importing contracting parties shall, as soon as possible, inform the exporting contracting party concerned or, where appropriate, the re-exporting contracting party concerned, of significant instances of non-compliance with phytosanitary certification. The exporting contracting party or, where appropriate, the reexporting contracting party concerned, should investigate and, on request, report the result of its investigation to the importing contracting party concerned.
g) Contracting parties shall institute only phytosanitary measures that are technically justified, consistent with the pest risk involved and represent the least restrictive measures available, and result in the minimum impediment to the international movement of people, commodities and conveyances.
h) Contracting parties shall, as conditions change, and as new facts become available, ensure that phytosanitary measures are promptly modified or removed if found to be unnecessary.
i) Contracting parties shall, to the best of their ability, establish and update lists of regulated pests, using scientific names, and make such lists available to the Secretary, to regional plant protection organizations of which they are members and, on request, to other contracting parties.
j) Contracting parties shall, to the best of their ability, conduct surveillance for pests and develop and maintain adequate information on pest status in order to support categorization of pests, and for the development of appropriate phytosanitary measures. This information shall be made available to contracting parties, on request.
3. A contracting party may apply measures specified in this Article to pests which may not be capable of establishment in its territories but, if they gained entry, cause economic damage. Measures taken against these pests must be technically justified.
4. Contracting parties may apply measures specified in this Article to consignments in transit through their territories only where such measures are technically justified and necessary to prevent the introduction and/or spread of pests.
5. Nothing in this Article shall prevent importing contracting parties from making special provision, subject to adequate safeguards, for the importation, for the purpose of scientific research, education, or other specific use, of plants and plant products and other regulated articles, and of plant pests.
6. Nothing in this Article shall prevent any contracting party from taking appropriate emergency action on the detection of a pest posing a potential threat to its territories or the report of such a detection.

XXIX. Appendix I. Interpretations as agreed by the thirteenth session of the committee on agriculture
Preamble:
It was understood that "taking into account" (fifth indent) does not result in a legal obligation.
Article II:
The definition of pest was adopted with the understanding that the term "injurious" includes both direct and indirect damage.
It was noted that the use of the term "technically justified" does not automatically require that the rationale for a phytosanitary measure be made immediately and publicly available. Such information is only required on request, under provisions of Article VII. 2 (c) of the revised text.
Article IV:
While the term "consignments" includes non-commercial commodities, such as those carried by passengers, throughout the Convention, Article IV.2 (c) will not be interpreted to mean that official national plant protection organizations have obligations for the inspection of all outgoing passengers.
Article V:
It was understood that the phrase in Article V.2(a) "public officers who are technically qualified and duly authorized by the national plant protection organization" includes officers of that service.
Article X:
To avoid numerous references to standards throughout the text, it was agreed to include in Article X.4 "contracting parties shall undertake all activities related to this Convention in accordance with relevant international standards unless judged inappropriate for reasons that are technically justified".
Article XI:
Article XI.5: It was agreed that the quorum of the Commission should be addressed in the rules of procedure for the Commission. The rules of procedure should also consider the possibility of voting by correspondence.
Article XVII:
The European Community (EC) confirmed that in implementation of Article XVII.3, the EC would, on adhering, be submitting a supplementary declaration describing the division of competencies between the EC and its Member States with respect to matters covered by the IPPC.
MODEL PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATE:
The International Standard on the issuance of the Phytosanitary Certificate should be prepared. It should clarify the use and proper completion of the "place of origin".
The statement "they are deemed to be practically free from other pests" represents an option available to the exporting contracting party.
It is recognized that the proposed revision to the certifying statement for the phytosanitary certificate is an interim solution only. It is expected that this statement will be reviewed again as soon as the revised Convention has been adopted by the Conference. The references to "considered to be free from the quarantine pests" and "deemed to be practically free from other pests" should be especially reviewed.

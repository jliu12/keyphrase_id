International introductions of Inland aquatic species.

SUMMARY
A total of 1 354 introductions of 237 species into 140 countries are analyzed. The number of introductions carried out rose from the middle of the last century until the 1960s and have lessened since then. Introductions have been made for aquaculture, management of inland water fisheries, ornament and control of unwanted organisms. Many introductions have been made for purposes unknown or by accident. The introduction of new species of aquatic organism involves a number of risks including, degredation of the host environment, disruption of the host community, genetic degradation of the host stock, introduction of diseases and socio-economic effects. Major risks of damage to native environments and fish communities are associated with introductions of species which stunt and with major predators. It is concluded that the introduction of new species is a valuable management tool but, because of the risks to the host community, any further introductions should be made only
after careful consideration on any impacts.
An updated register of known international introductions is presented.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The preparation of, this document has only been made possible by the very helpful collaboration of fisheries workers from all over the world. Great assistance has also been received from the members of the staff of the Fishery Resources and Environment Division of FAO, as well as from the Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme. Particular thanks are due to my secretary, Mrs. Rine Sola, for typing and formating the document.

INTRODUCTION
Large scale introductions of fish species into areas outside their native range is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Some transfers of fish nay be considered ancient, in that they date from the middle ages in Europe but the majority of such movements date from the end of the last century. The detrimental effects of some introductions soon became apparent, but until recently were insufficient to cause widespread concern. However, with the development and spread of aqua-culture and an increasing public awareness of the environment fears of the impacts of introductions of fish species have grown. This lead the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to form a Working Group on the introduction and Transfer of Marine Organisms which formulated a Code of Practice which was adopted by ICES in 1973. The International Consultation on Fishery Resources Allocation (Vichy, France, 1980) and the Eleventh Session of the European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission
(EIFAC) held during 1980 both recommended that the procedures for introducing fish species into freshwaters be reviewed. As a result EIFAC adopted a Code of Practice based on the ICES model at its Fourteenth Session (Bordeaux, France, 1987). All other FAO Regional Fishery Bodies dealing with inland waters have also expressed their concern about introductions at their sessions and are currently investigating the relevance of the ICES/EIFAC Code to their own situations.
The development of the Codes of Practice also involved the framing of definitions relating to the Code which are followed in this volume:
Introduced species (Includes both non-indigenous and exotic species): Any species intentionally or accidentally transported and released by man into an environment outside its present range.
Transferred species (includes transplanted species): Any species intentionally or accidentally transported and released within its present range.
Transfers are usually intended to support stressed populations, introduce genetic diversity into a stock or to reestablish a species whose stocks have failed locally. Introductions are intended to insert a totally new element into the fauna.
One reservation is made with respect to these definitions in that a species is considered to have been introduced to a country once it has crossed national boundaries. This means that species are included in the listing if they are transported into a country as part of current commercial practice for food or ornament and not for stocking into natural environments. Experience has shown that even such species may have impacts through the release of pathogens or through escape.
This volume deals primarily with international introductions and generally excludes the many more introductions made between river basins within national territories. It is recognized that this distinction does not appear consistent ecologically because movements of species say from the Eastern to the Western drainages of the Soviet Union or the United States may be far more significant than an introduction from Netherlands to Germany. This limitation of scope may be justified however, in that the number of intranational introductions is so large as to defy the kind of listing made in this document. Furthermore passage over political frontiers poses problems of planning and legislation that differ in complexity from those facing a single nation seeking to regulate movements of species within its own frontiers.
The development of Codes of Practice and protocols for considering and carrying out introductions has been accompanied by the collection of data on the introductions that have actually been carried out. This information has been collected not only from literature but also in response to requests for information circulated to member countries of FAO. These replies resulted in the publication of a Register of International Transfers of Inland Fish Species (Welcomme, 1981) and additions and corrections to that document are included in the present volume which now presents a synthesis of information provided by scientists and fishery administrators from 140 countries. The nature of much of the information contributed makes direct referencing of many of the entries difficult and for those wishing to deepen their knowledge of this topic more complete bibliographies exist, e.g. Rosenthal (1978).
A database such as this can never be complete and much information is still lacking in several areas. For instance, the listing of introductions into the OSSR is far from complete and many invertebrate introductions, such as those of the Mysidaceae, into the waters of the USA and USSR to enhance fish food production, are not included. It is intended that the database be updated and to this end it would be greatly appreciated if all readers communicate any additional information relating to transfers of Inland aquatic species to: R.L.

TRENDS IN INTRODUCTIONS
A total of 1 354 introductions of 237 species into 140 countries are recorded in this document. These consist of records of the first introduction of any species into a country. Because many introductions of a species into any one country have been carried out on a repeated basis these represent only a part of those reported. Furthermore, these records do not include the sometimes extensive transport of a species within a country once it had been introduced.
Trends in time in the numbers of introductions are summarized in Table 1, from which it is apparent that the spread of exotic fish species around the world essentially dates from the middle of the nineteenth century. A few introductions, termed ancient or historical had occurred before this period. Typical of these is the history of the common carp which, perhaps, was spread to a limited extent by the Romans and, certainly, diffused throughout continental Europe in the 13 - 15th centuries along with monastic fish farming. Such movements, however, were isolated. Since 1850 the pattern of introductions has shown a steady increase, until 1960, when, at 41 introductions in one year, a peak in movements occurred.
After 1960 the rate of new introductions has apparently declined. This slackening in the rate of the international transport of species has several possible origins. Firstly, legislation in many areas of the world, which has arisen from a growing awareness of the possible negative consequences of species introductions, has slowed if not stopped the flow. Secondly, there may be a saturation effect whereby a species reaches a level where it has been introduced to all suitable recipient areas. These effects can be detected in Table 2 where the introduction rate of successive groups of species attains a peak and then diminishes relative to other groups.

The frequency of introduction of individual species varies considerably (Table 3) and the majority of species have only been introduced to few countries. Eighty six percent of the species that have been introduced have been recorded from 10 countries or less and 40% have been recorded from only one country. At the other extreme, 9 species have been introduced into more than 30 countries. Many of these species are very widespread throughout the world, and three in particular, Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis mossambicus and Salmo gairdneri, each with over 50 host countries, have become pan-global within the limits set by their thermal tolerance.
A country or region may be also expected to attain a state where it has received all suitable species, and perhaps many that are not suitable. Such effects at the national or regional level are more difficult to detect because of the bias introduced by the large number of introductions that were carried out between 1950 and 1980.

Table 4, which shows the number of species introduced into different continental areas each decade, gives no indication that this process occurred. On the contrary, the impression is that the rate of introductions was sustained in all areas until the 1960's and declined thereafter. Interesting details are that Europe had an early history of introduction in the later decades of the 19th century and maintained a high rate of introductions until the 1970's. Introductions into Africa started later and reached a peak in the 1950's. The rate of introductions into South and Central America on the other hand continued to increase until the present, and this region is now the major importer of fish species.

This Table provides information on the different intensities of introductions in various regions. North America, South and Central America, Europe and Oceania are all areas where the number of introductions per country is high relative to the mean, whereas in Africa and the Middle East this index is low and Asia is almost at the average level. This situation is confirmed when the analysis is carried out by individual country (Table 5).

The logic behind these intensities of introduction is sometimes unclear. The presence of many island states (irrespective of region) and of European countries in the list of major receivers of exotic species is understandable as both categories generally have impoverished fish faunas. It is difficult to explain the large number of introductions into the countries of North, Central and South America. Here there are numerous species capable of fulfilling most of the functions for which fish are usually introduced, and which have themselves been exported to other regions for these purposes. The rationale for these introductions clearly lies elsewhere.

MOTIVES FOR INTRODUCTIONS
The different motives for performing introductions are listed in Table 6. This listing is far from complete. There is a high percentage (23%) of introductions where the reasons were unknown. There are also some 10% of the recorded introductions where appearance in natural waters is listed as accidental. In these records the original motive for the introduction of the captive stock is not recorded. Furthermore, in many cases where an objective is defined for carrying out a particular introduction it is unclear. For example a reported motive such as 'stocking into reservoirs' conveys little information as to what the species is supposed to accomplish once it is in the water body. It might be supposed that the person responsible for planning the introduction was clearer in his own mind as to the reasons for the action, but a surprising number of introductions appear to have been performed for what today would be considered trivial motives. Among these, nostalgia of displaced
peoples for familiar fauna to surround them would seem to rank fairly highly. Many of the earlier movements of species following colonization may have been made on this basis, even though they were seemingly irrational in that adequate local species already existed or that the species was poorly adapted to its destination. Similarly, simple dietary preferences or sporting prejudices may have motivated movements of some species such as common carp or trout. In many cases introductions have been carried out for more than one motive thus the totals in Table 6 do not correspond to those of other tables.
The motives for which exotic fish species have been moved from country to country have changed with time (Table 7 and 8). To better illustrate these trends a difference has had to be drawn between the absolute number of introductions made for any purpose (Table 7) and the relative importance assigned to any motive in any decade as indicated by the percentage (Table 8).
Introductions made for aquaculture have been the most numerous. They have always comprised a significant proportion of the total at any time but have grown in importance in more recent decades. Since the beginning of the 1970's introductions made for this purpose have accounted for well over half of all introductions made. Sport fishing has provided the second major motive for introduction with a relatively constant number of introductions per decade. Relatively introductions for this purpose have declined in importance since the 1950's. Introductions made for the improvement of capture fisheries in lakes, reservoirs and rivers increased in number from 1950 to 1979, when they overtook sport fishing as the second most important motive. The use of fish species for control of unwanted organisms has a long history but most of the introductions made for this purpose have been concentrated into the decades from 1950 to 1979.

Unknown: including introductions made by private persons
Three categories are somewhat more problematic. Most of the introductions of fish species for ornament have been made by private individuals or have resulted from escapes into the wild. The date at which the introduction occurred is frequently unknown and trends are difficult to identify. The date of introductions arising from various types of accident are likewise generally unknown, although there does appear to have been a slight trend for numbers of accidental introductions to have risen over the years although as a percentage they have declined considerably. Introductions which were made for motives which are unknown have also tended to rise numerically until the 1960's but as a percentage of all introductions they reached a peak in the 1940's and have since declined. The most substantial reduction in this category since 1970 indicates that introductions of exotic species have been more carefully documented in recent years.

Aquaculture
Ninety eight species of fish have formed the subject of international introductions associated with aquaculture (Table 9). Many of these have been introduced into relatively few countries often for purposes described as experimental. Relatively few species have been widely distributed, only 10 species have been introduced into more than 10 countries and only 4 into more than 30.
There has been an historical trend in the species introduced (Table 10). Early international movements of species, up to 1900, mainly involved fresh water salmonids such as Salmo gairdneri, Salmo trutta and various species of Salvelinus which were introduced into temperate regions for aquaculture associated with the maintenance of sport fisheries as well as for limited food production. More recently salmonid introductions have involve anadromous forms which are being used for mariculture in cages. Common carp reached their maximum popularity in the decades between 1910 and 1940 and were successively replaced by tilapias (1950 - 1979) and Chinese carps (1960 - 1980) as preferred species. Current trends point to an increasing number of crustacean species which are being introduced around the world for the rapidly expanding brackish water shrimp culture.

Introduced species have played a major role in the development of aquaculture across the world. The early expansion of aquaculture in Europe through the monastic tradition was based on a species, Cyprinus carpio, that was exotic to most of the countries involved. Subsequently, commercial intensive culture of rainbow trout in Europe, cage culture for Atlantic and Pacific salmon, tropical culture of tilapia species in Brazil, Thailand, Cuba, Sri Lanka, Chinese carp culture in South East Asia and brackish water shrimp culture have all been based on species introduced from elsewhere. The failure to deploy what are often judged equally desirable local species for aquaculture has often been cited as a criticism for this policy. However, there is a well known trend for food producers to cut risk by using technologies that are already established. This would explain the relatively narrow selection of species used in contemporary aquaculture. There is now a tendency to explore the
potential of local species, such as Colossoma in Latin America, which, should they prove successful for culture, may well set of a new round of movements involving such species.

Species originally introduced for aquaculture eventually escape from the confinement of their ponds often but not always to colonize natural waters. Therefore any introduction made for aquaculture must be thought of as a potential addition to the wild fauna in the receiving country.
Management of Inland Waters
The second category of introductions are those aiming at the manipulation of wild, or modified stocks in natural water bodies. Stocks of this kind are used for sport or recreational fishing and for a variety of food fisheries ranging from subsistence to fully commercial. The two major categories are frequently difficult to differentiate and the same stock may also be exploited by both sport and food fishermen. Most correspondents reporting introductions were clear in listing 'angling' or 'sport' as reasons for introductions but difficulties arise in categorizing motives such as introduction of forage species for predators introduced for recreational purposes. Here only introductions listed as having been made for sport are placed in that category.
Sport
Seventy eight species have been recorded as having been introduced for sport (Table 11). A great number of these are either salmonids or larger predators having the fighting qualities sought by sports fishermen. Furthermore sports fishermen show two distinct tendencies. There are those which are attached to some traditional target species, particularly salmonid fishermen. This motive was the prime driving force behind the widespread dissemination of rainbow and brown trouts throughout the world in the earlier decades of this century (1900 -1930). It also accounts for the spread of centrarchid species between 1930 and 1950. There are also those that seek diversity and a number of species have been introduced to increase the variety of fish available to the recreational fisherman.
Many of the introductions made originally for sport fisheries have subsequently been adopted for aquaculture or have formed the basis of stocks which are exploited by subsistence or commercial fishermen.

Improvement of wild stocks
From Table 6 it can be seen that a range of motives are cited for introducing fish species for the improvement of wild stocks. The major motivation, however, is to introduce some element that is perceived as lacking to the fauna of a water body. This is usually termed 'to fill a vacant niche' or some variant of it. Although not strictly in line with the niche concept, which sees the niche as a property of the organism, the idea of a vacant niche is used to describe the perception that there are resources within a water body which are not being used efficiently for lack of a suitable species. This applies particularly in faunistically poor regions such as cool temperate areas affected by glaciation during the ice ages, islands east of the Wallace line or high altitude mountain lakes. Not surprisingly most of the introductions made for this motive have been made into countries having these types of water. It also applies in new habitats such as reservoirs or regulated rivers,
where the indigenous fauna lacks elements competent to establish themselves in the new water body. A good example of this latter is the introduction of tilapiine cichlids into reservoirs advocated by Fernando and Holcik (1982). Allied to the above motive are those introductions made to replace faunistic elements lost through environmental change. The introduction of new faunistic elements into the Great Lakes of North America was undertaken for this reason. Extensive introductions of new crayfish species into European waters have also been made in an attempt to reconstitute stocks after the native species were virtually wiped out by disease.
Often the introduction of one species produces the need to introduce further species. Following introduction of major predators into fish communities which are not adapted to heavy predation the decline in native species is such that it has often been assumed to be necessary to introduce a forage species more closely adapted to survive alongside the predator. Classic examples of this are the introductions of Lepomis species to mitigate the impacts of black bass introductions, the use of tilapias or Cichlasoma as forage for Cichla ocellaris and the introduction of Bairdiella icistia to provide a prey species for Cynoscion xanthulus in the Salton Sea. Conversely, predatory species have been introduced into many areas to control stunted populations usually of tilapias and sunfishes. A further example of this type of serial introduction occurs where herbivorous fishes such as Ctenopharyngodon idella or common carp, which exert an eutrophicating influence on the water, convert
primary producers from macrophytic to phytoplanktonic organisms. The resulting algal blooms can achieve nuisance proportions and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix has been introduced to correct for this. These types of complementary introduction have been formalized in aquaculture as polyculture systems and further introductions can be anticipated as knowledge of the eco-manipulation of small water bodies for extensive culture increases.
Several successes have followed the introduction of species as a foundation for fisheries, although negative effects have also been produced. The introduction of the pelagic clupeid Stolothrissa tanganyikae into Lakes Kivu and Kariba and its accidental diffusion downstream to Lake Cahora Bassa have led to the establishment of substantial stocks of fish. These form the basis of important fisheries which total some 20 000 tons annually. Other examples of important local fisheries which have been established through introductions are: tilapias (principally Oreochromis niloticus) in lakes and reservoirs in South East Asia and Latin America, Cichlasoma and Micropterus species in Central American lakes, Odontesthes bonariensis and Salmo gairdneri in Lake Titicaca and Punt Jus gonionotus in rivers of Philippine and Indonesian islands.

Micropterus dolomieui; Micropterus salmoides;
Oreochromis niloticus; Pacifastacus leniusculus
Cyprinus carpio; Lepomis cyanellus
Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
One minor but possibly growing motive for introductions is to protect a species which is endangered within its own habitat. Several introductions of Hucho hucho have been made for this purpose in Europe as have introductions of Gila orcutti and G. bicolor in the United States and Canada. This type of introduction tends to be made more within national boundaries thus this list is somewhat limited.
Ornament
The records for introductions of ornamental species are almost certainly incomplete. This category may be divided into two groups. Firstly large species introduced for stocking into natural waters or ornamental ponds. The main Species used for this purpose is the goldfish Carassius auratus auratus which has achieved a wide distribution by reason of its popularity for rearing in ornamental ponds. Another sub-species Carassius auratus gibelio has been introduced into some countries for food fisheries.
The second group consist of small, usually tropical species, that have been disseminated around the world by the aquarium fish trade. These species which number several thousand (see Conroy, 1975; UNCTAD/GATT, 1979) are a problem because they are rarely recorded as introduced. It is generally assumed that fish of this type can not survive in temperate climates and thus do not constitute valid introductions. This point of view is largely correct, although such species have maintained populations for many years in artificial warn waters such as discharge canals from power stations and in naturally warned waters such as hot springs. The diverse fauna recorded from the hot springs of the Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada are evidence to the persistence of such populations. In the tropics aquarium fish are either used by aquarists or are cultured in hatcheries for export. Ornamental fish species from all over the tropical world are cultured in Brazil, Colombia, Florida
(U.S.A.), Peru and Singapore, and the practice is probably more widespread than these reports indicate. Escapes from rearing installations are common and are probably responsible for the large number of small exotics reported from Colombia and Florida. However, it would appear that in most cases such escapes have gone unreported or even unnoticed and that the penetration by small species into tropical ecosystems is probably much greater than official statistics would indicate. So far only 38 species have been recorded as having been introduced for ornamental purposes and most of these usually form part of the aquarium fish trade. Detailed analysis of the waters adjacent to rearing installations would doubtless increase this number considerably.

Control
Fish have been used for many years to control undesirable organisms in the aquatic environment. An extensive literature exists on the various aspects of such control and a joint WHO/FAO/UNEP panel of experts meets to consider and evaluate the effectiveness of the various species. Reviews by this panel, for instance that of Petr (1987) summarize the literature available. Most of the earlier introductions for this purpose were made with the intention of controlling mosquitos and other vectors of water borne diseases but later control of aquatic vegetation became more important.
Mosquitos
Twelve species have been introduced for mosquito control of which 9 were introduced to one country only. More extensive introductions have been made with:
Poecilia latipinna introduced into 3 countries
Poecilia reticulata introduced into 4 countries
Gambusia affinis introduced into 21 countries
Control of mosquito larvae by small larvivorous fish species is highly effective and is replacing the more costly and environmentally dangerous control with insecticides. The introduced Gambusia is now being replaced by local species in many areas. Further dissemination of Gambusia is thus limited and a large number of small, native larvivorous fishes are being investigated for this role. An extensive literature exists on this topic, see for instance Gerberich and Laird (1968) and Haas (1984).
Snails
The efficiency of fish in controlling the snail vectors of schistosomiasis is less well known. In large reservoirs it appears to be almost ineffective despite the presence of numerous molluscivorous species. Greater success is claimed for more limited aquatic environments and in fish ponds Jhingran and Gopalakrishnan estimated a 64 - 98% reduction in snail populations using Astatoreochromis alluaudi. Currently the value of this species and a second, Haplochromis mellandi, is being made by the FAO African Aquaculture Development and Coordination Project. Astatoreochromis alluaudi has been introduced into only 5 African countries so far to control snail vectors of schistosomiasis but if trials prove successful the species may receive a much wider dissemination. Mylopharyngodon piceus has also been introduced into reservoirs in Israel to control gastropods without any need for control of schistosomiasis vectors.
Aquatic vegetation
Numerous species of fish eat aquatic weeds and a range of specialized phytophagous habits have been described which could be used to construct complex herbivorous communities (Shireman, 1984). Up till now this potential remains largely unexploited and only a few of fish have been introduced specifically to control aquatic vegetation although a number of other species may utilize this food source incidentally. Specifically, the following four species were recorded as having been introduced to control aquatic plants:
Oreochromis mossambicus introduced into 2 countries;
Tilapia zillii introduced into 2 countries;
Tilapia rendalli introduced into 4 countries;
Ctenopharyngodon idella introduced into 28 countries.
Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella have been successfully used for control of aquatic macrophytes in many countries and probably provides the only practical method for control where the use of herbicides is overly costly or undesirable (Negonovskaya, 1981; Shireman and Smith, 1983; Shireman,1984). This species normally has the advantage that it does not breed in the waters to which is introduced thus permitting periodic adjustments in the number and sizes of fish present. It is also considered a valuable edible species in many areas of the world and can play a useful secondary role in food supply. The use of this and other species for the control of a range of aquatic weeds is reviewed by Petr (1987a).
Blooms of phytoplankton
Hypophthalmichthys molitrix has been introduced into five countries to control heavy blooms of phytoplankton in natural waters.
Accident
About 10 percent of introductions into natural waters were unplanned and resulted from some form of accident or private initiative. It is likely that this proportion is even higher as many of the introductions whose motives are reported as unknown may also lie within this category. This relatively large percentage of unintentional introductions illustrates the difficulty of containing an introduced species within limited environments such as ponds or aquaria and support the principle that a specie must be regarded as introduced into a country once a breeding pair have crossed the national boundary. Other sources of new species are, the introduction of fry of non-target species along with those of a species whose introduction was intended, the escape or release of bait fish, and the transportation of eggs, juvenile or adult fish in the ballast water of ships. This last phenomenon is common in marine and brackish water species (see Carlton.1985) but some freshwater species
appear to have been transported in this way. Once established in one country some species have diffused through freshwater systems in different parts of the world. For example carp moved naturally down the Uruguay river from Brazil to invade Uruguay and Argentina, the mitten crab diffused from an original site in West Germany to occupy much of Northern Europe and Stolothrissa migrated down the Zambezi river from Lake Kariba to establish itself in Lake Cahora Bassa. This mobility of species once they have been introduced illustrates the need for international agreement to limit the spread of undesirable species and to reduce risks of introduction of ones that are judged to be useful.

RISKS OF INTRODUCTIONS
Experiences throughout the world have shown that a number of problems may arise following the introduction of a new species. The impact of introductions has been examined in detail in many individual countries (see for example Rosenthal, 1976; Contreras and Escalante, 1984; Taylor et al., 1984; Baigun and Quiros, 1985; Eldredge, 1986) who identify the following principle negative effects.
Degradation of host environment
The effects of introductions of aquatic organisms on the environment are frequently surprising especially as the new species may adopt a niche that differs completely from that occupied in its native range. The most striking example of such behaviour is the penetration of a Micronesian marine atoll by Oreochromis mossambicus (Lobel, 1980). This species is normally adapted to moderate salinities as it inhabits estuaries in its normal habitat but its penetration into more saline areas was unexpected. Similar flexibility has also enabled other species of cichlid to expand outside of temperature ranges that would normally be limiting. Thus, in the Southern United States, species that are normally tropical have established themselves in sub-tropical or even warm temperate regimes (Noble, 1980).
Unexpected shifts in habitat of these types are not necessarily detrimental to the environment. Indeed they may result in occupancy of waters which would otherwise remain unoccupied due to the inadequacy of local species. However, more severe effects have been recorded in some cases. For example the common carp, through its habit of rooting around in the bottom, has the reputation of muddying the waters it occupies. This shades out macrophytes, chokes benthic invertebrates, and through the more rapid recycling of phosphate contributes to accelerated eutrophication. As a result the composition and abundance of the native fish fauna has been altered, as in India, where species of the genus Schizothorax have disappeared from waters to which carp had been introduced, together with the fisheries based on them (Jhingran and Sehgal, 1978).
These effects are rarely noted in areas where the carp has been established for some time, as for example in Europe, and McClaren (1980) concluded that such effects were correlated with the excessive numbers of the species that develop shortly after Introduction. Moreover, population expansion by this and other lowland species often follows upon modification of the environment by man usually through dam construction. In these cases native rheophilic species would probably not be able to survive the changed conditions even in the absence of better adapted competitors (Minckley and Mefee, 1987).
Ctenopharyngodon idella has been introduced into many areas of the world with the intention of eliminating submersed and emergent vegetation. It usually performs this task adequately but, through selective feeding on more tender species may favourize the development of tougher vegetation which is even more of a nuisance. Furthermore, the removal of submersed vegetation which forms the spawning substrate of phytophilous fishes may cause a reduction in numbers of such species. Concern has also been expressed in several areas over the elimination of weed beds which form the principal protective refugia of young fish and certain amphibia, and the feeding habitat of waterfowl.
Other examples of modification to the habitat are produced by burrowing forms such as Procambarus clarkii and Eriocheir sinensis, both of which are judged pests due to their habit of constructing galleries in levees and pond banks.
Disruption of host community
Fish assemblages receiving an introduction may be altered through competition between the new and the existing faunistic elements, by direct predation on the native species or by other aggressive effects.
Competition
Some introductions have proved so effective that the new species has been able to out compete existing fishes resulting in a considerable reduction in their populations or even in their complete disappearance. For example, in Tashkent in the U.S.S.R. a number of fishes including - Opsariichthys uncirostris; Hypseleotris swinhonis; Hemiculter leucisculus; Hemibarbus eigenmanni; Percottus glehni and Pseudorasbora parva - which were accidentally introduced together with Ctenopharyngodon idella, resulted in declines in local species through superior growth and fecundity (Rosenthal, 1976). Similarly, native species have been unable to compete with introduced tilapiine cichlids in some southern states in the United States of America (Noble, 1980), Cichlasona managuense displaced local predators in El Salvador, Poecilia reticulata has been blamed for the decline in numbers of local cyprinodonts in Uganda and also in the southwestern United States, and Lepomis auritus has supplanted
Alburnus alborellus in some Italian oligotrophic lakes.
Competition is not United to trophic interactions but also to such other ecological limiting factors as breeding space, as in the case of Lake Victoria where Introduced Tilapia zillii and indigenous Oreochromis variabilis shared the same nursery habitats to the detriment of the endemic species (Welcomme, 1967). Aggressive behaviour on the part of the introduced species can also alter distribution patterns of native fishes as shown by studies on interactions between brown trout and indigenous salmonids in the U.S. (Taylor et al. 1984).
Predation
One of the recurrent themes in reports of the impact of introductions is the elimination by predation of local species. These are sometime localized in distribution and sufficiently rare as to cause concern for possible extinctions. Recently the introduction and spread of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in Lake Victoria has attracted particular attention. This predatory species has possibly led to the extinction of over 300 species of haplochromine cichlid and is considered by many as a major disaster (Barel et al., 1985, Rybbink, 1987). While evidence from fishing does indicate that the Nile perch has eliminated many species it is too early to make a definitive evaluation of its impact. In an earlier case, where Cichla ocellaris was thought to have removed several species of fish from Gatun lake, Panama (Zaret and Paine, 1973), the supposedly eliminated species later recolonized the lake from refugia. Although the parallels are not exact some of the Lake Victoria species may
have survived in a similar manner. Another case of severe disturbance to an endemic species flock was Lake Titicaca. Here Odontesthes bonariensis and Salmo gairdneri were implicated in the decline of stocks of native Orestias and Trichomycterus species. The precise mechanism for the decline was obscured by the possibility of predation, heavy fishing pressure on both introduced and native stocks, competition for food as the diet of introduced and native species is similar. Some native species have declined or disappeared, particularly Orestias cuvieri which was described by Tchernavin (1944-and is now no longer caught. Orestias pentlandi, Trichomycterus rivulatus, and T. dispar have also become extremely rare (Hanek, 1982), however, Orestias species still make up 942 of the 6 000 tons of fish caught in the lake.
Rainbow trout have been implicated in the disappearance or decline of small native species in many countries. In addition to the effects on stocks in Lake Titicaca they have been implicated in the disappearance of other Andean Orestias and Trichomycterus species in Colombia and Chile. They have also been involved in the reduction of native salmonid populations in Lake Ohrid, Yugoslavia (Nijssen and de Groot, 1974), Schizothorax species in Himalayan rivers, Oreodaimon gnathlambae in Lesotho, Trachyistoma euronotus and Sandelia capensis in South Africa (Jackson, 1960), Protroctes oxyrhynchus and Galaxias gracilis in New Zealand (McDowall, 1984), and other galaxiids in Australia. Although brown trout have not acquired the same reputation as rainbows for the elimination of native species McDowall (1984) describes the disappearance of Galaxias divergens and G. argenteus from waters in which S. trutta had been introduced.
Another predator that has been blamed for the disappearance of local species is Micropterus salmoides. This is said to have caused the decline of Alburnus alborellus, Esox lucius, Perca fluviatilis and introduced Lepomis species in some Italian lakes, although the disappearance of perch and pike may have been through competition. The species is also blamed for the destruction of local fish stocks in Lakes Atitlan and Calderas in Guatemala; stocks of Chirostoma ester, several species of Goodeidae and other native species in Lago de Patzcuaro and other lakes in Mexico; several species of cichlid, themselves introduced into Lake Naivasha, Kenya, and a riverine catfish Amphilius platychir in some Zimbabwean waters. The effects of predation by M. salmoides have possibly been avoided in some other water bodies by the contemporaneous introduction of forage fish such as Lepomis species.
Feeding by large carnivorous species on adult prey is not the only type of predatory interaction. Many smaller species can prey on juvenile fishes and some cyprinodonts, particularly Gambusia affinis are said to feed on the eggs of other species. Although the impact of this does not seem to have been quantified, nor any cases of damage to a specific species cited, concern was expressed by many correspondents as to possible damage arising from this habit.
Stunting
The quality of the stock of fish in any water body can also deteriorate through stunting by the introduced species. Stunting is a process whereby the population of a species expands rapidly, producing large numbers of individuals which mature and breed at a much reduced size. This behaviour appears in natural waters and in aquaculture ponds and considerably diminishes the usefulness of the population for sport or commercial purposes. Fish species which have been reported as producing stunted populations include:- Alburnus alburnus; Carassius auratus; Lepomis cyanellus; L. gibbosus; L. macrochirus; Oreochromis mossambicus; O. niloticus; Perca fluviatilis and Tilapia rendalli. Stunting is not confined to fish species as two crustaceans, Macrobrachium amazonicum and M. rosenbergii also show this behaviour.
It is this aspect of several of the tilapiine cichlids which has most seriously limited their usefulness for establishing fishable populations in natural waters and for aquaculture. Stunted populations also tend to suffocate already established species by denying them living space and, in extreme cases, by creating oxygen deficient conditions in the water. They also prevent introduction of new, more suitable species for the same reasons. Oreochromis mossambicus has been the most troublesome in this respect and the elimination of this species has been attempted in many areas, generally without success.
Genetic degradation of host stock
Ecological studies of the racial composition of fish in large water bodies such as the Great Lakes of North America point to the considerable local adaptation to local conditions of the various stocks within any one lake. Because of this newly introduced races or stocks of fish are more likely to reduce than to enhance genetic fitness of local stocks to their own environments. In such circumstances 'hybrid vigour' may not be an advantage for, although as is well known, intense inbreeding leads to loss of viability in any breeding line, this is unlikely to occur under natural conditions where the brood stock contains a number of parental lines. Hybridization or crossing of genetic lines may be effective in aquaculture where limited brood stocks can lead to loss of vigour, or where desirable strains can be produced by judicious mixing of characters.
Fishes are generally more plastic in their potential for interbreeding than are mammals. Thus fewer crosses between fish species result in sterility, and hybrids may be produced spontaneously and persist under natural conditions. Introduced individuals may thus interbreed with closely related native forms or with individuals of other introduced species especially where one of the introduced forms is rare relative to the other. Under the stresses involved in introduction normal behaviour patterns may be broken down and hybrids formed from species or even genera that co-exist naturally and which do not normally hybridize. One example reported by Maciolek (1984) was a cross between Micropterus salmoides and Lepomis macrochirus in at least two Hawaiian reservoirs. If the native stock, or one of the introduced stocks, has characteristics that are especially useful for fisheries or aquaculture these are apt to be diluted through such crosses and the purpose of the introduction
negated.
In Africa and Latin America there has been a widespread breeding of different genetic strains, particularly of the tilapiine cichlids, which has already resulted in a considerable mixing of the gene pool (Wohlfarth and Hulata, 1981). Other genera of cichlid such as Cichlasoma hybridize with equal facility under wild conditions and other families have shown similar behaviour. For example, in the Cyprinidae Groot (1985) comments on the extensive intermingling of the many strains of common carp following on the introduction or transfer of different varieties. In the Salmonidae concern has been expressed in Europe on the movements of hatchery reared fish because individuals escaping into the wild carry with them genetic characteristics that are less adaptive than those of the wild stock. In the Poeciliidae the introduction of Xiphophorus helleri, X. maculatus and X. variatus into Mexico led to genetic swamping of the native X. couchianus which is now an endangered species. The
uncertainty as to the origins and characteristics of local stocks following extensive hybridization of fish in the wild is particularly inconvenient for the aquaculturist who requires predictability of growth, yield and nutrient demand of the fish he rears.
Introduction of disease and parasites
One of the most persistent risks inherent with movements of living organisms around the world is that pathogens and parasites associated with the organisms be spread to new hosts in the receiving area. This is particularly important where the organisms are cultured and are thus concentrated in such a way as to increase their susceptibility to disease. Fish and crustacean species have proved no exception to this and many examples of outbreaks of new diseases or parasite infestations following introductions of new species are now on record.
In contrast to some environmental and populational impacts. Introductions do not have to be definitive for a disease to be introduced. The recent appearance of nematode parasites of the genus Anguillicola in Europe is an example of this. The parasite, which is endemic to Australian and Asiatic species of Anguilla, was introduced into Europe together with imported oriental eels intended for human consumption and not for stocking into natural waters. Nevertheless the nematode escaped and has since spread rapidly through the waters of Northern Europe. Another introduced disease, probably originating from ungutted Pacific salmon carcasses imported for consumption, is IHN (infectious haemato-poietic necrosis), which has only recently been recognized in France (Anon., 1987). These examples of introductions of diseases from fish never intended for introduction into natural waters indicate the potential dangers of transporting any biotic material over national frontiers.
Many of the diseases of salmonids that infect hatchery reared fish and have also established reservoirs in wild populations are introduced. Furunculosis appeared both in Europe and South America following the introduction of rainbow trout from Western North America (Snieszko, 1973). Similarly, infectious dropsy of cyprinids spread rapidly around continental Europe in the 1930's after carp were transferred from Yugoslavia without adequate sanitary controls. More recently, Michel et al. (1986) traced the sudden appearance of Yersinia ruckeri, the causative agent of enteric redmouth disease, to uncontrolled shipments of a North American minnow Pimephelas promelas for bait.
These examples are drawn mainly from Europe where the state of knowledge of fish hygiene is relatively advanced and controls are enforced. However these and other diseases could also have been imported into other parts of the world and so far remain unreported. Certainly a range of disease organisms and parasites are potentially transferable should adequate standards of hygiene and quarantine not be enforced (Shotts and Gratzek, 1984; Hoffman and Schubert,1984).
Socio-economic effects
Impacts of introductions are not limited to biological and ecological effects but may also have socio-economic implications. This is particularly apparent when an introduced species which is not favoured for consumption displaces a more desirable species from a fishery. A typical example of this occurred in India where Oreochromis mossambicus were introduced into reservoirs which they colonized but were not accepted by local populations. This has proved to be a typical pattern with certain tilapiine cichlids whose poor flavour and small size has rendered them generally unpopular.
The introduction of Nile perch into lake Victoria emphasized another set of economic problems. In the first place the fishery on Lake Victoria had been based on small cichlids whose capture required small mesh gill nets. The need for the fishermen to re-equip with nets of the appropriate size to capture Nile perch exceeded the possibilities of many of the poorer fishermen and a shift from subsistence fisheries pursued by small scale fishermen to more commercial operations for export, financed from urban centres occurred. Furthermore the technology to process and consume the larger more oily fish posed considerable difficulties and has resulted in a degree of deforestation to provide firewood for processing. These changes may have been only transitional but have produced a marked shift in the rural economy of the region.
Aquaculture is a high risk industry and where local economies become dependent on it financial vulnerability is high. Disease is perhaps the major threat to intensive rearing operations but other problems arising from the genetic integrity of the stock may also be significant. Modern aquaculture depends heavily on exchange of genetic material through transfers and introductions, therefore especial surveillance is needed to ensure that risks are minimized.

EVALUATION OF INTRODUCTIONS
The unbiased evaluation of introductions is virtually impossible because of the many different viewpoints that are brought to bear on natural ecosystems that are at the same time used for the production of food or some other value. At one end of the spectrum the strict conservationist is reluctant to see any change in 'status quo'. In this context aquatic ecosystems are particularly exposed. The innumerable changes in terrestrial ecosystems caused by the introduction of food crops have already been absorbed and have established the functional equilibria we equate with the landscape today. Introductions into aquatic environments, on the other hand are current, less integrated into the ecosystem and consequently more evident. At the other extreme the purely commercially oriented would wish to introduce species and modify ecosystems to maximize profit regardless of the damage to the ecosystem. These opposed views tend to coincide with different economic circumstances.
Post-industrial societies, located mainly in the temperate zones, tend to place emphasis on the protection of the environment and thus approve only those species which produce minimum disturbance in the quality of the natural system. Conversely, rural societies of the tropics may be willing to tolerate quite considerable environmental change in favour of an immediate solution to food deficiencies. Because the units of measurement are so disparate it is inadvisable to use terminology which imply success or failure to an individual introduction but rather to consider a type of balance sheet of costs and benefits. Here one can only be guided by local perceptions as expressed in correspondence. Unfortunately this is highly subjective and does not permit comparability between assessments of introductions made by different countries. However, in certain species a clear consensus appears and in these cases some more definitive judgement can be made.
Examination of the introductions and comments reported in this document shows that six patterns of behaviour follow an introduction.
(i) The introduced species never becomes established, disappears without trace or its fate is listed as unknown. This happened in 298 (22.01%) of the introductions reported but this is probably a considerable underestimate due to failure to fully report such occurrences. Apart from the numerous cases where species were introduced into inappropriate climates and habitats, or the introduction was made in insufficient numbers as to ensure establishment, the reasons for the inability of a species to establish itself in the host waters remain obscure.
(ii) The introduced species does not breed under natural conditions and is maintained artificially or by continuous import. 246 (18.17%) of the introductions reported are of this type which is particularly common with species having commercial value for aquaculture, such as rainbow trout or the Chinese carps, and for species such as the grass carp which are used for controlling undesirable organisms. Ostensibly species which are maintained by artificial reproduction are easier to control and to eradicate from the natural waters when their purpose is served. However, continuous import heightens the risks of introduction of disease and grass carp have frequently been accused of environmental degradation. Continued failure to breed in the wild can not be assumed either as self breeding stocks of Ctenopharyngodon idella have appeared in both the Mississippi and Danube river systems.
(iii) The introduced species become locally established in an unusual habitat. Thirteen (0.96%) cases of colonization of thermally polluted waters in the temperate zone were reported from Canada, where at least six aquarium species occupied hot springs in Banff National Park, Alberta for a number of years; and from Australia, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where a few species have been maintained in warm water discharges from factories or power stations. Such populations occupy areas inaccessible to native temperate fishes and persist so long as the favourable conditions are maintained but disappear when the thermal source is removed. Forty nine introductions were recorded where temperate species, usually the salmonids - Salmo gairdneri, Salmo trutta and Salvelinus fontinalis - are maintaining themselves in cold, high altitude waters at tropical latitudes. In these cases climatic conditions are more stable and the introductions can be regarded as
permanent additions to zones whose native faunas are generally impoverished.
(iv) The introduced species establishes and maintains itself either as widespread populations at very low densities, or as isolated populations in individual water bodies or aquaculture installations. With 440 (32.50%) recorded instances this is the most common outcome of introductions, and, although it is improbable that a new element can be inserted into a fish community without its affecting native populations to some extent, the instances in this category have had effects that are so slight as to occasion no positive or negative comment.
(v) The introduced species establishes itself and may even increase rapidly in abundance to become a dominant element of the population. Later the species disappears or declines in abundance. The decline may occur naturally or may be deliberately eradicated. This type of behaviour was recorded in 36 (2.66%) instances. Of these eight were deliberately eradicated, five were tropical species established at the limits of their thermal tolerance and which died during particularly winters and one was eliminated by pollution. Other species established viable but low level populations which were unable to compete on a sustained basis and died out. A few species, notably Lepomis cyanellus, Oreochromis mossaabicus and O. niloticus showed the typical 'boom and bust' phenomenon. To a certain extent this might be expected of any species transported into waters where its preferred food is under utilized by existing species and the resulting population explosion is later brought into
equilibrium with the available resources. However, it is difficult to explain why a once successful species disappears completely as has happened on several occasions.
(vi) The introduced species becomes a significant or dominant element of the host fauna as has happened in 321 (23.71%) records. Of these only 89 (6.57%) had sufficient impact on the local environment or fish stocks to cause serious concern. The other 232 (17.13%) were judged either neutral or even beneficial in their effect.
Several authors have described the ecology of introductions and have examined the possible reasons why species do or don't become established in any particular area (Stauffer, 1984; Taylor et al., 1984). Taylor et al. concluded that establishment of exotic fishes was most likely in
(i) aquatic habitats with mild year round temperatures;
(ii) disturbed or altered habitats, and
(iii) communities of low diversity.
While the present data are not of high quality and are possibly biased in favour of reporting species that have become established, it is the most extensive body of information on introductions on a global scale and should yield some information to clarify these ideas. There seems little doubt, for instance that the contention that introductions succeed in zones where species diversity has been kept low relative to similar areas elsewhere is correct. Apart from aberrations such as thermally polluted waters in the temperate zone two groups of habitat are particularly good examples of this: islands whose freshwaters are inhabited at low levels by secondary colonizers and highland lakes and rivers in the tropics. In both the establishment rate of introductions has been high; in tropical Islands 200 established out of 273 recorded introductions in Islands (73.3%) and in high altitude tropical waters the establishment rate of salmonids was 49 established out of 67 introduced
(73.1%). Similar trends have also been noted in the impoverished communities of the Western drainage of the United States (Moyle, 1986). The statement that the likelihood of introduced species establishing themselves in disturbed habitats is less easy to demonstrate. There seems no doubt, however, that the particular success of common carp is due to environmental changes brought about by damming and that other introductions have been particularly successful in colonizing new reservoirs. However, this situation is very similar to that where fish communities are impoverished because in many cases the original inhabitants are unable to adapt to the changing regimes and no native species can colonize the altered system. In some circumstances an introduced species may establish itself at low density in a stream only to expand in numbers when conditions are changed by impoundment. The history of introductions in the United States, described by Moyle (1986), illustrates this
interplay between introduced species and environmental changes. In this region, as in much of the rest of the world, species introductions have been made contemporaneously with increases in major environmental stresses. It is thus often uncertain whether the declines in local species and increases in abundance of introduced species are traceable to the introduction, to the environmental changes, or to both.
It has also been suggested that there are basic differences between the modes of colonization of tropical and temperate waters with 'r' selected species being more successful in temperate regions and 'K' selected species being more successful in the tropics (Stauffer, 1984). This idea originates from the supposition that complex tropical fish communities are in some way more 'saturated' than those of the temperate zone and that the probability of successful colonization by a new species is higher in simple communities with low diversity. A concept of species saturation has been developed in support of this whereby it is implied that any given environment can support only a limited number of species. This would suppose that the proportion of species becoming established in the complex communities of the tropics would be less than that in the temperate zone.
508 introductions were recorded from tropical and sub-tropical countries of which 318 (62.6%) were established, as against 573 introductions made into warm and cold temperate countries of which 324 (56.5%) became established. As to the relative effectiveness of different reproductive strategies in determining whether or not any particular species becomes established, it is difficult to neatly categorize species under this concept especially as some apparent 'K' strategists may switch to 'r' strategies when introduced into a novel environment. A broad classification, where species having one major spawning per year of many small eggs are grouped under 'r' and species showing some degree of parental care (nest builders, mouth brooders, live bearers etc.) are grouped under 'K' selection. Is presented in Table 14.

This table excludes data on Chinese and common carps, which have been introduced into both climatic zones and are usually maintained artificially, and anadromous and catadromous species.
Table 15 shows the results of chi-square tests comparing establishment success in various ecological zones and of 'r' and 'K' selected species.

Tropical: 'r' selected v 'K' selected

'K' selected: tropical v temperate
Despite the poor quality and possible incompleteness of the data it is possible to conclude that success of establishment of species in tropical waters is very similar with introductions into the tropics being slightly more successful in terms of forming breeding populations that those made into temperate waters. The success of introductions made into ecosystems with impoverished native faunas (cold, high altitude streams in the tropics or islands) was very similar. Those made into islands were significantly more successful than those introduced into tropical mainlands, whereas introductions into tropical highlands were only significantly more successful than those made into tropical lowlands at the 5% level.
In temperate zones there was little difference between the success of 'r' and 'K' selected species but in the tropics 'K' selected species did significantly better. Because of the different nature of tropical and temperate communities 69.6% of tropical introductions were made with 'K' selected species as opposed to only 19.1% of temperate ones.
It is not possible to draw any conclusions from this data set as to which factors, if any, influence the success of introduced species in establishing themselves. Indeed the conclusion reached by the 1986 Royal Society Symposium on Biological invasions that there are no sure-fire criteria for predicting the fate of introduced species seem equally applicable here. On the other hand it is usually possible to identify the reasons for the successful establishment of a species after the event.
Evaluation of the desirability of introductions of individual species is highly subjective but in many cases the replies to the questionnaires have given an indication of how some species have been viewed which may serve to guide others who are considering similar introductions. The present listing is similar to Chat made by Welcomme (1984) but has been modified in some particulars as more information has become available. The majority of species have had impacts so slight that they occasion no comment. The rest can be classified into three groups.
The majority of species that are definitely described as pests (Table 16) are species, generally 'r' strategists, which respond to their new environment by forming dense, stunted populations (i). This behaviour makes them useless for anything but forage for other fishes and caused a disproportionate amount of environmental nuisance. Other species in this category are burrowers such as Eriocheir sinensis or Procambarus clarkii which cause costly and even dangerous damage to river and pond banks. Oreochromis mossambicus is also labelled as a pest despite its value to fisheries in Brazil and Sri Lanka because of the degree of disapproval it attracts. Its poor flavour, tendency to stunt and to eliminate competitor species are seen as overly disadvantageous especially as other tilapias give better results. Lates niloticus is included as a pest because of its drastic environmental and socio-economic effects and because it will probably lead to a diminution in the overall
productivity of the water bodies to which it was introduced.

Another group of species are controversial in that they have created ecological problems of various kinds but are, at the same time, perceived as being extremely useful (Table 17). There is a high proportion of predatory species (*) which have been implicated in eradication of endemic fishes as well as species which form dense, stunted populations (§). However, nearly all have made a contribution to food production, control of unwanted organisms or sport fisheries which is perceived as greater than any damage caused.

Other than disease related problems these species have not been identified with any major environmental impact. Some show a tendency to stunt (§) but this is viewed as a minor problem.
Of the 237 species forming the subject of the 1354 introductions examined here only 71 made sufficient environmental impact to warrant mention by the correspondents. Of these 25 (10.7%) were judged pests and thus wholly negative in their impact. The remaining 47 (19.8%) were considered beneficial despite varying degrees of negative effect. The majority (69.5%) of introduced species, therefore were judged innocuous.
It also can be concluded that, apart from disease related effects which may be independent, serious impacts on the environment can be anticipated from two main classes of species:
(i) those whose reproductive pattern enables them to fora stunted populations and
(ii) major predators, especially where these are introduced into communities which lack ichthyophages.
The evaluation of international introductions of inland aquatic organisms can, perhaps, best be summarized in a statement made by the 4th Session of Committee for Continental Fisheries of Latin America (COPESCAL) Working Party on Fishery Resources:
"The introduction of new species into areas from which they were absent constitutes a valuable tool for the management of inland wafers for capture and culture fisheries. However, such introductions involve considerable risks to the health and ecological integrity of existing populations of fish through transfer of diseases, degradation of the ecosystem and the formation of undesirable hybrids. It is therefore necessary to examine proposals for the introduction of further species with extreme care in order to minimize the risks of unforeseen consequences".
<section>7</section>
MEASURES TO REDUCE RISKS OF TRANSFERS
It is tempting to avoid the numerous risks inherent in introductions and transfers of living aquatic organisms by prohibition of all further movements of biotic material of this type. This solution is overly simplistic, firstly because further introductions will continue to be needed for sound development and management of inland fisheries and aquaculture and secondly because established commercial practices make such prohibition virtually impossible to enforce. It is important, therefore, for individual countries to adopt regulations and procedures which will minimize the risks arising from introductions. As introductions into one country frequently find their way into the waters of adjacent nations it is also important that the various national legislations be harmonized for any continental area.
At present compilations from Europe and from Latin America show that existing legislation is haphazard and in some cases non existent. There are frequently loopholes which exclude complete categories of organisms such as those imported for food, for scientific purposes or for ornament. Often too regulations governing importation of fish are included in more general provisions for import of all living organisms administered by agencies having scant comprehension of the problems of the aquatic sector.
Several authors have addressed the problem of the types of action needed to rectify this situation both at national and international levels (see for example Kohler and Stanley, 1984; Rybbink, 1987). Such proposals usually include recommendations that detailed studies be carried out on candidate species for introduction, and that once the decision to introduce is taken biotic material for introduction be imported as eggs and that some type of quarantine procedures be adopted for introduced material prior to its release into natural waters. Such codes of practice may also be supported by more detailed protocols which describe the precise steps to be taken for study, quarantine and release of imported material (e.g. Kinkelin et al., 1985). There are those who are of the opinion that it is impossible to be completely certain as to results of any introduction. While this view is in part correct because of the unpredictability of the reactions of living organisms under novel
situations, it is hoped that, by application of suitable codes of practice and protocols, the chances of such surprises would be very much reduced.
The major code that is being applied at present is that of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which has also been adopted in slightly modified form by the FAO European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission (EIFAC) (Turner, 1987). At the time of writing the same code is being studied for adoption by Regional Bodies in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Anguilla
There is a very important and widespread commercial trade in eels between Europe and some Indo-Pacific countries. This involves movement of young (glass) eels as well as the live transport of adults. The trade is aimed at consumption and aquaculture, and only rarely at stocking natural waters thus lying outside the strict scope of this listing. Several species are involved including A. anguilla, A. japonicus, A. australis and A. rostratus. The scale of this trade is indicated by the Federal Republic of Germany which imports eels of different species from at least 17 countries. This type of movement is especially difficult to document fully but many European countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, F.R. Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Poland regularly import or export material. The major effect of the uncontrolled movement of eels has been the introduction of a series of nematode parasites of the genus Anguillicola into Europe. These are spreading rapidly throughout the
native stocks whose potential for breeding may be seriously reduced in consequence.
Anguilla anguilla L.: ANGUILLIDAE
Native range: Rivers of North Atlantic, Baltic and Mediterranean Seas.
Atlantic eels are popular food fish in many European countries. The species is catadromous and is threatened both in the freshwater and marine phases of its life cycle. Wild stocks are threatened by pollution and river control works over much of the native range and stocking or rearing of elvers fished in Atlantic coastal estuaries is normal commercial practice throughout Europe. Some exports of elvers to other parts of the world have also been developed but as this species can not reproduce outside of its Atlantic Ocean breeding sites risks of its becoming established are minimal.

Anguilla australis PHILLIPS: ANGUILLIDAE
Native range: New Zealand, S.E Australia and some Pacific Islands.
A catadromous species inhabiting coastal ponds and lakes, shortfinned eel have been caught in large numbers by native fisheries for a long time. The fishery is now in decline due to competition from farmed stocks. Introductions of this species are unlikely to be successful as the species is not known to breed outside of its Pacific spawning ground.

Aristichthys nobilis RICHARDSON: CYPRINIDAE
Native range: China and Eastern Siberia
The bighead carp is one of the group of Chinese carps which are widely reared for aquaculture in their native range. The species has been introduced into numerous countries and has achieved a near global distribution. However, its breeding requirements are very inflexible and stocks are maintained by artificial reproduction or by continuous import in most areas. This means that the risks of the species becoming established are minimal, although risks of co-introduction of disease organisms remains. In some systems where the environmental conditions resemble those in the native streams e.g. the Danube some self breeding stocks have appeared. The existence of acclimatized populations in the Danube suggests that the species is present in other Danubian riparian states such as Rumania, Czechoslovakia and Austria from which it has not been formally reported. Even so stocks for aquaculture in Danubian countries are still artificially reared. Biological data on bighead carp have
been summarized by Jhingran and Pullin (1985).

Native range: Eastern Europe, Central Asia and China
This species has two sub species C. a. auratus (the goldfish) which is the asian form and C. a. gibelio (the Prussian carp) which is the Eastern European form. The common goldfish has have acquired a pan-global distribution through its widespread introduction for ornamental purposes. Escapes and deliberate releases have resulted in natural populations in over 20 countries and its actual distribution is probably far wider than that indicated here. For instance the species is a firmly established element in the fauna of Central Europe, Southern Scandinavia and Spain in addition to the few countries listed here. In the tropics the distribution of C. auratus is usually confined to between 200 and 1000 in altitude. The environmental effects of the species tend to be somewhat neutral although in some areas it is regarded as a nuisance due to its capacity to produce stunted populations. The Prussian carp has been less widely introduced although it has expanded its range westwards
into much of the rest of Europe. Both varieties forms the basis for small scale fisheries and aquaculture.

Caraasius carassius L.: CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Eastern and Central Europe.
Although it is a well established element of the fish fauna of much of Europe, the crucian carp was probably introduced or diffused into western Europe along with the common carp in the middle ages. C. carassius has a strong preference for quiet almost stagnant waters and is found in ponds, lakes and the slow flowing lower reaches of rivers throughout its native and introduced range. The species is of moderate importance for capture fisheries and is cultured in Europe and much of Asia.

Catla catla (HAM. BUCK.): CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Indian sub-continent and Burma
The catla is one of a group of large cyprinids which are termed major carps in India. In their native range they are widely cultured and juveniles are removed in large quantities from the rivers to stock reservoirs. The success of this species in its native India has led to several introductions mostly for experimental aquaculture to assess the potential of the species for more generalized rearing. These experiments have generally failed in that the species has not been adopted for widespread culture, although in some areas, such as Mauritius, successful aquaculture operations have been established. The species generally fails to breed naturally in ponds and thus it has to be maintained through induced breeding. Nevertheless escaped fish have established self-sustaining populations in some rivers in the Philippines. Biological data on catla have been summarized by Jhingran (1966) and Jhingran and Pullin (1985).

Channa (Ophiocephalus) striata BLOCH: CHANNIDAE
Native range: Southeast Asia
Because of its auxiliary air-breathing organs the snakehead murrel is highly resistant to low dissolved oxygen concentrations in water. This characteristic makes it especially valuable for fisheries and culture in anoxic tropical water bodies and for transport to distant markets as it can be kept alive for long periods out of water. These characteristics also made the species a favourite with long distance mariners who used it for food but also assured its introduction to many of the South Pacific islands even as far away as Hawaii.

Cichla ocellaris BLOCH and SCHNEIDER: CICHLIDAE
Native range: Tropical South America
This large and highly predatory, tropical species is highly valued for the quality of its flesh and its sporting characteristics. As a consequence the tucunare (Portuguese), Pavon (Spanish) or peacock bass has been introduced to other areas of South and Central America lying outside its native range. The species is also being considered for aquaculture but its predatory nature limits its usefulness for this purpose. The results of the introduction of the species to Lake Gatun in Panama were documented by Zaret and Paine (1973) who alleged that Cichla had eliminated six species of native fish from the lake fauna. It now appears that this evaluation may have been overly exaggerated as a new balance is reported between the predator and the native species, many of which persist in refugia in the mouths of inflowing streams. The situation is further complicated by the introduction of other species, including some O. niloticus which provide an alternative prey.

Clarias batrachus (L.): CLARIIDAE
Native range: Southeast Asia from Sri Lanka to Malay peninsula
The walking catfish of Southeast Asia is popular for aqua-culture within its native range where very high yields are obtained. The fact that the fish can breathe air by using its auxiliary breathing organs makes it very resistant to anoxic conditions and enables very dense populations to be maintained in ponds. It has been introduced for aquaculture to several other Southeast Asian countries where it has not generally been regarded with favour. In Florida the species is caused some alarm when it first became established due to its unfamiliar habit of leaving the water to migrate to other water bodies.

C. gariepinus is senior synonym of C. lazera. In common with most other clariids the species is highly resistant and can survive extremes of aquatic deoxygenation and even desiccation. It is omnivorous with a marked tendency to feed on benthic organisms and detritus. Several attempts have been made at culturing the species and to this and it has been introduced to parts of Africa from which it was previously absent. The success of these introductions in terms of aquaculture have been negligible and there is uncertainty in most areas as to whether the species has become established in natural waters.

Ctenopharyngodon idella (VALENCIENNES): CYPRINIDAE
Native range: China and Eastern Siberia
The grass carp, one of the Chinese carps, has been widely transported around the world for two main purposes, aqua-culture and the control of undesirable aquatic vegetation. The success of the fish in performing these two functions has been the subject of an extensive scientific literature which has been summarized in part by Shireman and Smith (1983). The grass carp has very strict breeding requirements (Jhingran and Pullin, 1985) which preclude its being able to reproduce in most of the waters into which it has been introduced. In many cases populations are maintained by repeated stocking with imported or artificially bred fish. Nevertheless allegedly self-breeding populations have been recorded from the Danube and the Mississippi rivers. Similar populations have also been noted in localities within the Soviet Union into which the species was introduced.

This species, known to the aquarium trade as the two-spot climbing perch, has been widely diffused by the aquarium trade. It air-breathing habits make it very resistant to poor oxygen conditions but its high temperature requirements make it unlikely that it could become established in the temperate countries that are the main importers of tropical aquarium fish.

Cyprinus carpio L.: CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Japan, China, Central Asia
The common carp is probably the first fish species to be subject to wide scale transfers and introductions. According to Baton (1974) wild carp were taken from the Danube for culture by the Romans and subsequently distributed widely throughout Europe as part of the medieval monastic fish pond tradition. The species was spread independently within China for similar purposes. During a period beginning about the middle of the last century the carp was spread in a series of introductions until it has achieved a near global distribution and is present in most areas where climatic conditions permit its survival. The carp has proved a controversial fish. On one hand it is one of the principal species used for inland aquaculture and provides some 250,000 tons of fish per year globally from this source alone (Pullin, 1986). In several areas the species is also the subject of capture fisheries which increase its contribution to human nutrition. On the other hand the species has been
implicated in degradation of the aquatic environment mainly through its habit of rooting in the bottom which causes turbidity and deoxygenated conditions. In some of the cases the success of the introduced carp has followed on changes to the environment produced by other human activities and the carp have merely moved in on an environment where the native species were destined to disappear anyway. There is an extensive literature on the common carp; see for instance MacCrimmon (1968) or Alikunhi (1966) and Sarig (1966).

The Alaska blackfish is an anomaly in chat it is the only freshwater species occurring in Alaska that does not also occur in Canada. In Alaska this arctic species served as a traditional source of food for local populations and their dogs. One attempt to introduce the species into Ontario was unsuccessful which was surprising due to its hardiness in its native range.

The threadfin shad is a small clupeid with wide habitat tolerances within the warm temperate waters of Eastern North America. The species undergoes population explosions in reservoirs which have caused it to be branded a pest. However its small size makes it an ideal forage species and it has been introduced into reservoirs outside its native range in North America, as well as elsewhere, to serve that function.

The Chinese or mitten crab was probably introduced into European inland waters in the ballast water of ships docking at Bremen. It first appeared in the Aller River, West Germany, diffused rapidly through the Rhine and Elbe watersheds and penetrated to other North European countries through canals and river connections. The species is considered a delicacy in its native range but is a pest in Europe where its habit of burrowing into river banks and attacking fish caught in fishing gear causes a nuisance.

Fundulus zebrinus JORDAN and GILBERT: CYPRINODONTIDAE
Native range: Central U.S.A. from N.E. Montana to Texas
A small cyprinodont which can withstand considerable variations in temperature with season. Although not native to Mexico the natural range of this fish extends very close to the border with the U.S. Thus the only recorded introduction of this species represents an extension southwards of its natural range.

Gambusia affinis BAIRD and GIRARD: POECILIIDAE
Native range: Southern U.S.A. and Northern Mexico
The aptly named mosquito fish is one of the species with the widest range of introductions. The species has been transported to every continent to. control mosquitos and has thus acquired a near pan-global distribution. Its extreme tolerance of low as well as high temperatures and of low dissolved oxygen conditions has favoured its establishment over. wide range of climatic conditions. The success of this species in controlling mosquitos has been the subject of mud debate (see for example Gerberich and Laird, 1968). The use of biological vector controls waned with the introduction of pesticides, but recent ecological concern as to the effect! of such bio-toxins has led to a renewed interest in biological control.

Helostoma temmincki KUHL and VAN HASSELT: ANABANTIDAE
Native range: Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Greater Sunda Islands
The kissing gourami is a popular fish for aquaculture in the Southeast Asian region, where its resistance to low dissolved oxygen makes it ideal for rearing in waters of marginal value to most other species. The species has been introduced into islands of the Indo-Pacific outside its original range for this purpose. The kissing gourami is also a popular fish with aquarists and has been widely transported throughout the world as part of the trade in tropical ornamental species. As a result of escapes from aquaria the species has been reported from U.S.A. and Colombia but its successful establishment in other tropical waters is likely.

Heterotis niloticus (EHRENBERG): OSTEOGLOSSIDAE
Native range: Senegal, Niger, Chart and Nile basins
Heterotis is a tropical species inhabiting lower reaches of rivers and their floodplains. Its auxiliary branchial air breathing organs enable it to survive in deoxygenated waters. The hardiness of this fish together with its great growth rate make it a candidate for aquaculture in Africa and it has been transported to a number of countries for this purpose. On the whole the species has given satisfactory results under culture. Escapees from ponds into the wild have also established populations which form the basis for fisheries.

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (VALENCIENNES): CYPRINIDAE
Native range: China and Eastern Siberia
The silver carp is one of the Chinese group of carps which has been distributed throughout the world for aquaculture. The species is primarily planktonophage and is used widely in polyculture and also alone for the control of algal blooms. Like other Chinese carps silver carp do not normally breed outside their native rivers and stocks are maintained by artificial reproduction or by continual import of fry. Naturally breeding stocks have appeared in the Danube and, although breeding is not confirmed, wild fish have been collected from the Mississippi indicating that self-breeding communities become established outside the native range if conditions are right.

Ictalurus punctatus (RAFINESQOE): ICTALURIDAE
Native range: Central and Eastern United States
The channel catfish is a large (125 cm) warn temperate species which is of great importance to aquaculture. The species has been widely distributed in Canada and the United States outside its native range. It has also been introduced outside of Northern America for aquaculture and sports fisheries. Successes with these introductions have been varied. In Europe for example the species has had little impact, but in Latin America it forms the basis for a rapidly growing aquaculture for export and local consumption. With the high commercial demand for cat fish expansion of current culture can be anticipated with the introduction of the species to further countries.

Labeo rohita HAMILTON: CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Indian sub-continent
The Rohu is one of the group of cyprinids known as the Indian major carps. It is highly favoured for stocking reservoirs and for aquaculture in India where it has been introduced widely outside its native range in the Ganges basin. Its bottom feeding habits make it ideally suited for rearing in rural domestic ponds and for polyculture. The species has been introduced to a number of countries outside of the Indian sub-continent and have been registered as useful for culture in Mauritius and the Philippines. Unfortunately it is less clear to what extent rohu has been successful in some of the other areas to which it has been introduced.

Lates niloticus L: CENTROPOMIDAE
Native range: Nile and Niger river systems
The Nile perch is a large (150 en) predator which was introduced into Lake Victoria. This introduction changed the ecology of the lake by virtually eliminating the many species of small cichlids which comprised a unique species flock. At the same time the fisheries of the lake have been simplified although the total catch has continued to rise. The longer term effects of the introduction will take many years to evaluate as at the time of writing no equilibrium had been reached between the fishery, Nile perch and the prey species. Nile perch introductions have been considered by U.S.A. (Texas) and by Australia for sports fisheries but these projects have been abandoned.

It has been widely introduced to other countries, mainly in South and Central America for brackish water aquaculture often associated with mangroves. It fails to breed naturally in ponds in most of these areas and stocks are maintained by artificial reproduction, however there is a strong possibility that self sustaining populations are established in natural waters. The refinement of culture techniques and the commercial potential of the species will probably encourage further introductions with a strong possibility chat it will eventually achieve pan-tropical distribution.

Native range: East and Southern U.S.A. and North Mexico
The largemouth bass is one of the most popular sport fishes in North America and as a consequence has been distributed over the whole of the U.S and some of southern Canada. The success of northward introductions is limited by its temperature requirements and the species tends to prefer somewhat warmer conditions than S. dolomieui. The higher thermal tolerance has enabled this fish to be successfully introduced into waters of many countries until it has attained near global distribution although its success in some truly equatorial countries has been limited. The species, which in its larger stages is completely piscivorous, has sometimes been blamed for the disappearance of local species (see for instance Italy and Guatemala) but on the whole has found favour as a sports fish.

Odontesthes bonariensis (CUVIER and VAUNCIENNES): ATHERINIDAE
Native range: Southern Argentina and Rio de la Plata
The 'pejerrey', a cool water predator is highly prized for the quality of its flesh. The fish is predominantly lacustrine but breeds in affluent rivers. It was Introduced into L. Nemi in Italy where it has thrived and formed the basis for a small fishery. Its introduction into L. Titicaca has been more controversial as the introduction of O. bonariensis together with Salmo gairdneri, has had an impact on the native species flocks. Most of the species have persisted in the presence of the introduced predators but one Orestias cuvieri has not been seen for 20 years and others, O. pentlandii, Trichomycterus rivulatus and T. dispar have declined considerably in abundance. The decline is possibly not simply due to competition or predation by the introduced species, of which S. gairdneri is probably the most serious, but also to overfishing and environmentally unsound practices (Hanek, 1982). The native species flock did not support a rich fishery whereas the fisheries now are
estimated to have a potential of 75-150 000 t, actual catches being about 6 000 t in Peruvian waters.

Oncorhynchus gorbuscha (WALBAUM): SALMONIDAE
Native range: Western seaboard U.S. and Canada, Eastern seaboard of Northern Asia
Originally the pink salmon was of less importance for food fisheries than the other Pacific salmons but has gained in importance since the 1940s as a commercial and sporting species. It was introduced to Newfoundland in 1958 and has established a small population on the Atlantic coast of Canada. International introductions have mainly centered firstly round the Kola Peninsula from which it has spread to other parts of Northern Europe, and to the Caspian and Black Seas, and secondly as part of the repeated attempts to establish Pacific salmon in the Southern waters of Chile and Argentina.

The chum salmon is one of the most important of the Pacific salmons for commercial fisheries in its native range. However, it has been used less for introductions than the other species. Attempts to introduce it to the North American Great Lakes failed as did those in Chile. Wore recently introductions into Northern European waters of the U.S.S.R. have apparently resulted in small populations becoming established.

As an important commercial fish of the Pacific coast coho salmon have also been introduced into the East coast of Canada and the U.S. Populations are maintained in the Great Lakes, mainly by artificial reproduction and stocking although recently self sustaining stocks have appeared. The species has also been successfully established in Chilean waters and is maintained in Argentina by artificial propagation. Attempts to establish breeding stocks in Europe have so far met with no success although escapees from aquaculture do sometimes appear in natural waters.

Orconectes limosus RAFINESQUE: CRUSTACEA; ASTACIDAE
Native range: East coast U.S.A. Maine to Virginia
This crayfish was one of the earliest introduced into Europe in an attempt to replace the Astacus astacus which was disappearing due to the crayfish plague caused by Aphanomyces astaci. The species spread throughput much of Northern Europe either by deliberate introduction or by diffusion. The American freshwater crayfish is not as highly appreciated as other species for its flesh but its high fecundity, disease resistance, and tolerance of deoxygenated and polluted waters have contributed to its rapid spread.

Oreochromis mortimeri (TREWAVAS): CICHLIDAE
Native range: Zambezi basin
O. mortimeri is very taxonomically BO close to O. mossambicus that some authorities consider it a sub-species of the latter. There are however colour differences between the two forms. There is some possibility that confusion between the two forms has occurred in stocking in some regions. Known international introductions of fish of the O. mortimeri type are limited to the use of the species for stocking dams in Zaire.

Oreochromis mossambicus (PETERS): CICHLIDAE
Native range: Lower Zambezi and associated East African rivers
The earliest international movements of tilapiine cichlids were with this species. Since its appearance in Java in the 1930s, possibly through the escape of aquarium fish, the species has spread through deliberate introduction, diffusion or escape of pond fish until it has achieved pan-tropical status. Originally thought of as an ideal pond fish the readiness with which O. mossaabicus stunts has brought it into disrepute in most areas. Escapees have occupied natural waters where their prolificity and proneness to produce stunted stocks has gained them pest status. Nevertheless large quantities of the species are fished from estuaries, rivers, ponds, canals, ditches and rice paddles so its contribution is not wholly negative. The species is very hardy and resistant to high salinities even to the extent of occupying some/narine environments (Lobel, 1980). In aqua-culture O. mossambicus continues to be used in Asia as a major species but elsewhere it is mainly used for the
production of monosex hybrids especially with O. niloticus (see 'red tilapia'). As a tropical species this fish would be unable to breed in the natural waters of many of the temperate countries to which it has been introduced.

Oreochromis niloticus L.: CICHLIDAE
Native range: River Nile, Chart basin and Southern Israel
Naturally the most widely distributed of the tilapiine cichlids O. niloticus is one of the most popular for culture and for stocking dams. It has less of a tendency to produce stunted populations and has good growth characteristics and taste, and for these reasons has been substituted for O. mossambicus in many regions. It is also widely used for producing mono-sex hybrids together with such species as O. mossambicus. It has been very extensively transported around the world and has achieved pan-tropical status. As a subtropical species this fish would be unable to breed in the natural waters of many of the temperate countries to which it has been introduced.

Three geographic sub-species and stocking with mixtures of these and with other Oreochromis species has resulted in extensive hybridization. Results of numerous introductions into other African countries are uncertain failing reports on the breeding status or use of the species.

The guppy is a highly resistant tropical species which will tolerate temperatures as low as 15° Ñ and survive in poorly oxygenated water. It is very prolific and spreads rapidly through ditches, swamps and ponds in areas to which it has been introduced. As well as its great popularity with aquarists and the inevitable escape and deliberate release of aquarium fish, the species has been introduced widely for mosquito control. It has now attained a pan-tropical distribution and is also found in many temperate countries as well as in specialized habitats such as hot springs in countries with severe winters. The guppy eats the eggs of other fish and has been blamed for the decline of several species through this egg eating habit or through direct competition for food.

The angelfish has long been one of the favorite species of aquarists. It is very sensitive to low temperatures and normally inhabits fairly acid waters. For this reason the success of escaped fish is likely to be limited and only two cases of fish being caught in the wild have been recorded, both in South America adjacent to the Amazon, where physical ad chemical conditions are similar.

Rasbora trilineata STEIHDACHNEK: CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand
The three-lined rasbora is one of the many species of this genus which have been disseminated around the world by- the aquarium fish trade. It is a tropical species and would not survive under natural conditions in temperate waters but £t is surprising that escapees of this and ofher Rasbora species have not been reported from tropical countries other than Colombia.

Rhodeus ocellatus (KNER): CYPRINIDAE
Native range: Taiwan Island, China
This species, the rosy bitterling, was introduced into Eastern China, The Korean peninsula and Japan at some time past as an ornamental species. Escapes led to such effective colonization of the waters of these countries that the species was for a long time considered native. Accidental introduction to Fiji probably also resulted from escapes of ornamental specimens.

Salmo gairdneri (RICHARDSON): SALMONIDAE
Native range: Western seaboard of U.S.A., Canada and Northern Mexico
The rainbow trout (priority synonym Parasalmo mykiss) is one of the nest widely introduced of fishes and may be regarded as global in its present distribution although, in the tropics it is only established at altitudes above about 1200 m. The history of its introductions was documented by MacCrimmon (1971) although further movements have occurred since his paper was written. First introductions of rainbow trout were for sporting purposes but its adoption for aqua-culture led to an accelerated spread in the 1950's. Furthermore, although introduced for angling many host countries subsequently expanded the distribution of the species for culture. It is now one of the main species cultured in temperate zones and at higher altitudes in the tropics. Rainbow trout have been implicated in the disappearance or decline of many small native species, through either predation or competition. They have, together with the 'pejerrey' been responsible for some decline in stocks of Orestias
and Trichomycterus species in Lake Titicaca. O. cuvieri has disappeared since the introduction and O. pentlandii, Trichomycterus rivulatus and T. dispar have been considerably reduced in abundance. The contribution of introduced species to this decline is obscured by recent overfishing and other bad management practices (Hanek, 1982). S. gairdneri have also been involved in the reduction of native salmonid populations in Lake Ohrid, Yugoslavia (Nijjsen and de Groot, 1974), Schizothorax species in Himalayan rivers, Oreodaimon gnathlambae in Lesotho, Trachyistoma euronotus and Sandelia capensis in South Africa (Jackson, 1960), Protroctes oxyrhynchus and Galaxias gracilis in New Zealand (McDowall, 1984), and other galaxiids in Australia.

Salmo trutta L.: SALMONIDAE
Native range: Europe and Western Asia
Brown trout has been distributed almost as widely as rainbows but with less success in warmer climatic zones where stocks are generally limited to above 1 500 m. The distribution of this species was discussed by MacCrimmon and Marshall (1968) and MacCrimmon, Marshall and Gots (1970). Where S. gairdneri and S. trutta have been introduced together the two species separate thermally with S. trutta in the cooler higher latitude and altitude streams. The success of the species has been limited by its lesser suitability for aquaculture with the result that introductions have remained primarily for sporting purposes. This trout has also been implicated in the decline of local species of fish particularly in New Zealand where it Galaxlas divergens and G. argenteus have largely disappeared from waters where brown trout are present (McDowall, 1984).

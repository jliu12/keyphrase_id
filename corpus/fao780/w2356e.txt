Foreword
This study on the position of rural women in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries is a first attempt to analyze the socio-economic status of rural women in the European countries in transition, and to highlight the similarities and differences between CEE and other European countries.
The study of transition economies has attracted great interest from economists all over the world. Large numbers of conferences and symposia have been held on different issues in regards to the transition over the past half decade. However, little attention has been given to analyzing how these changes are affecting marginal areas, such as rural communities and minority social groups, including rural women. In CEE countries (as in other European countries) the rural population accounts for up to 50 percent of the total population, and more than half of these are women. Rural women play an important role in rural development in these economies, and due to the increasing migration of men to urban areas, they represent one of the most important human resources for the socio-economic development of rural areas. Within this context, understanding the position of rural women in the economy, the community, and the household is crucial. Informed knowledge of women's needs, the
factors that hinder or foster their full participation, and the way in which the transition process is affecting their socioeconomic position is important in order to enhance the living conditions of the rural population.
This study attempts to present a clear picture of the economic position of rural women in ten Central and Eastern European countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria. The study represents ethnographic aspects of the socio-economic position of rural women. Austria, Ireland and Finland were used as reference countries to which the position of women in the selected Central and Eastern European countries was compared. The study is based on desk-research and, although many statistical indicators were lacking, the study nevertheless should serve to provide a better understanding of the situation of rural women in transforming rural economies.
For the purposes of this study, the term "rural areas" is based on national definitions, which substantially differ among the countries under consideration. In addition, since the statistical analysis presented relies on published statistical sources, no attempt has been made to distinguish women working on farms from women who are resident in rural areas and are involved in or working in secondary or tertiary occupations. Both categories of women constitute the target group of this study. This approach may weaken the analysis of variables, such as women's education level, training, extension, health care and social security systems, the implications of which should be taken into account when making evaluations and/or policy recommendations for countries under consideration, whether Central and Eastern European or reference countries.
In spite of the statistical limitations, the study highlights the position of rural women and the similarities and differences in these conditions among countries, as well as providing data which reflect the position of rural women at the national level. Furthermore, the study serves as a valuable reference point that enables further research on the findings presented, being one of the first attempts to contribute to the understanding of complex socio-economic issues of rural/farm women in the transforming Central and Eastern European countries.
This study has been undertaken in line with FAO's programme of assistance to Member Nations, and in particular to countries in transition, in order to raise awareness of the factors hindering rural women's full participation in, and benefits from, rural development in the region.

1. Background of the project
1. Background of the project
In 1993 the FAO/Regional Office for Europe (REU), in collaboration with the Women in Development Service of the Sustainable Development Department (SDWW), commissioned an analysis of the socio-economic situation and status of rural women and families in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, ^1 based on a proposal made by the Working Party on Women and Families in Rural Development at its October 1992 meeting in Innsbruck, Austria. A preparatory group was nominated at the same meeting, which held its first discussion on the project in Vienna in March 1993 ^2
(^1 In this document the term "CEE countries" is used to refer to the project countries and not to all Central and Eastern European countries.
^2 The group members were: Mr. Budavari, FAO/ECE/Geneva; Ms. Agnes Gannon, Ireland; Ms. Leena Kirjavainen, FAO/SDW; Ms. Gertraud Pichler, Austria; Ms. Jela Tvrdonova, Slovakia; and Ms. Pirjo Siiskonen, Finland.)
It was agreed that the study should focus on women's role in rural areas, on the farm and in the family; their participation in education, training, agricultural services and organizations; household technology and knowledge of home economics; social security systems and legal issues; and research projects and development programmes for rural women in the participating countries. In addition, an economic profile for each country was to be included.
The design of the study and the collection of data was entrusted to the Mikkeli Institute for Rural Research and Training, University of Helsinki. ^3 Ten countries were involved in the project: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia (Albania and Romania were invited but did not participate).
(^3 The Letter of Agreement specified the following responsibilities for the Mikkeli Institute: (i) research work, preparation of a data collection instrument, data collection at country level, correspondence and communication, processing and analyzing of data, consultancy; (ii) preparation of individual country reports (country profiles); and, (iii) production and dissemination of a scientific report and information on the results of the project. The report was written by Dr. Pirjo Siiskonen.)
The ministry of agriculture of each participating country nominated a national counterpart (hereinafter referred to as the "Focal Informant"), and charged with collection of data for the study. FAO/REU and the Mikkeli Institute organized a workshop for all focal informants on the process of data collection, the content of the questionnaire, information sources, the validity and reliability of the data, and the project timetable. The workshop was held in Nitra, Slovakia (17 to 19 January 1994).
The preliminary results of the data and analysis were presented and distributed at the 7th Session of the Working Party on Women and Families in Rural Development, held from 18 to 21 October 1994 in Athens. Following this session, a draft of the preliminary results was sent to all the focal informants in order to correct any faults and completing the missing data.

2. Objectives of the project
2.1 Objectives of the research
The objective of the research was to collect up-to-date data on women's role and status in society, in rural areas, on the farm, and in the family; women's participation in education, training, agricultural services and organizations; the level of household technology and knowledge of home economics; the social security system and legal issues confronting rural women; the greatest problems and priorities of rural women; and the latest research projects and development programmes involving rural women in the participating countries. Attention was focused on similarities among the countries as well as on differences. The results are, therefore, divided into two sections: generalizations on all the project countries, and separate country profiles.
The aim of the analysis was to draw a general picture of the situation of rural women in CEE countries, to identify any particular problems, and to describe the priorities of rural women in these countries for possible development into a national plan of action in the future. The results may also serve as guidelines for future activities of the Working Party on Women and Families in Rural Development (FAO/REU).
2.2 Collecting data
The data was collected by the Focal Informants in 1994. The preliminary report was verified by the Informants during 1994-95, and by the representatives of ministries in 1995 at a working seminar in Jäneda, Estonia, 13-16 June 1995.
The main research data comes from material collected by the focal informants in each country. All the data used are secondary, no rural women were interviewed. The questionnaire consists mainly of general statistical data (Annex 1). The data was collected from national statistical yearbooks (years 1990 to 1992) and complemented by up-to-date research data, where available. In addition, the Focal Informants were asked to estimate the greatest problems and the priority needs of rural women in their countries. The estimates given by national experts might be subjective.
Data was also collected for Austria, Ireland and Finland in order to compare the situation and status of rural women in these countries with those in the CEE countries. The Focal Informants were also asked to write short descriptions of their country, the agricultural sector, rural areas and women in society. Research reports were also enclosed by some respondents. In addition, the Mikkeli Institute collected both research and statistical data where available.
2.3 Validity and reliability of the data
The validity and reliability of the data depends in large part on the work done by the Focal Informants. The Focal Informants were trained at a seminar in Nitra, Slovakia, from 17 to 19 January 1994. The method of data collection was chosen because most of the national data, both statistics and research reports, are published in the national language only; using national researchers meant that no information sources were closed.
Although all the Focal Informants worked reliably and collected valid data, caution should be taken when comparisons are made among countries. Each country has its own statistical system and the categories used are seldom exactly the same. Moreover, it was impossible to collect data from every country for the same year; the data given by the Focal Informants were taken from the years 1990 to 1994 (the year concerned is mentioned in the footnotes of the tables). All national statistical data given by the Focal Informants has been checked when possible in global statistical yearbooks.
Unfortunately, some information from the countries is unavailable either from national or global statistics. Comparisons among countries should be done cautiously because changes taking place in CEE countries are exceptionally rapid; information given for the years 1990 to 1994 may no longer be valid for 1995.
To avoid misunderstandings among the focal informants, all the essential concepts and definitions were discussed and decided beforehand in the training seminar. In this analysis the term rural areas applies to areas that are not cities or towns, which has a slightly different, culture-specific significance in each country (see Box 1).
The concept rural women means all women living in rural areas, including farm women. Certain questions concern farm women specifically, in which case attention is drawn to the fact in both the questionnaire and the analysis.
Box 1: Definitions of rural areas by country:
Estonia: The entire country apart from settlements with more than 3000 inhabitants
Latvia: Areas other than or suburbs
Lithuania: Settlements not designated as urban in the legislation
Poland: Localities usually with fewer than 2000 inhabitants
Czech Rep: Settlements of up to 2000 inhabitants
Slovakia: Settlements with populations of fewer than 5000 inhabitants
Hungary: Settlements are administratively divided into tows (177) and villages (2915) - the villages are rural areas
Slovenia: Official statistics distinguish between urban (179) and non-urban settlements (5766)
Croatia: Areas around urban zones
Bulgaria: No information on the definition given
Finland: Sparsely populated areas and villages with fewer than 500 inhabitants
Austria: Urban areas have been defined - the remaining are considered rural
Ireland: Areas with fewer 1500 inhabitants

3. Descriptive results of CEE countries and rural women
3.1 Some general features of CEE countries
The main similarities among the CEE countries are geographical, historical and political. All the countries included are in Eastern or Central Europe. All have experienced great social and political changes since 1990, in the form of restoration of independence (Lithuania 1990, Estonia 1991 and Latvia 1991) or birth of a new independent country (Slovenia and Croatia 1991, the Czech Republic and Slovakia 1993). All the countries included are now parliamentary democracies with a multiparty political system. In most of the project countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria) processes of privatization and restitution of land property is on-going. Disputes among national majorities and minorities are problematic and acute in many countries; the national majority in Latvia is only 53.5 percent, in Estonia 64.2 percent, Lithuania 79.6 percent and Slovakia 85.7 percent. ^4 The main religion in most of the project countries is
Catholicism. Estonia and Latvia are the only countries in which the majority of people are members of the Lutheran church.
(^4 Focal Informants.)
However, there are also differences among the countries and each of them have their own history. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are Baltic countries sharing certain similarities that distinguish them from the others. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia are located in Central Europe although each has its own cultural and historical characteristics. Bulgaria is geographically the most southern country, but its political history has similarities with some Central European countries of the region.
Rural areas within the CEE countries also vary, and are sparsely populated or densely populated, mountainous or sub-mountainous, and near or far from urban centres. As a result, the economic activities and situation of rural women may also vary from area to area.
3.2 Rural development and rural women: some general features of rural women's role and status in CEE counties
All countries included are quite rural (Table 1). The rural proportion of the population varies from 49 percent in Slovenia to 25 percent in the Czech Republic. In the reference countries, the rural proportion is in the same range; in this sense there is no difference between the project countries and the reference countries. The most rural countries - taking the rural proportion of the population as the criterion - are Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.
Agriculture has long been the mainstay of the economy in rural areas, but its role is decreasing in all European countries. The proportion of the labour force employed in agriculture is largest in Poland (28.9 percent) and smallest in the Czech Republic (8.1 percent), where the agricultural proportion is on the same level as in Austria and Finland. The importance of agriculture to the gross domestic product (GDP) is highest in the Baltic countries (Latvia 24.8 percent, Lithuania 26.7 percent, Estonia 17.1 percent) and Bulgaria (16 percent) (Table 1).
In all CEE countries about half of the rural population are women. The proportion of women is largest in Latvia (53 percent) and smallest in the reference countries, in Finland (48 percent) and in Ireland (48 percent). The proportion of women in the population that is economically active in agriculture is largest in Poland (51.6 percent), Bulgaria (52 percent) and Slovenia (50.4 percent) and smallest in Ireland, where only 8 percent of those economically active in agriculture are women. In Poland, 60 percent of all economically active rural women work in agriculture, while in the Czech Republic the figure is 14.5 percent. ^5
(^5 Ibid.)
The role of women in agriculture is constantly changing in many of the project countries (especially in the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria) due to the process of privatization and the restoration of property rights. As a result, there are increasing numbers of private farms and farmers, while at the same time, the number of agricultural labourers is decreasing. Because the process is ongoing, it is very difficult to get up-to-date data on the sizes of different groups in agriculture in the project countries.

All the project countries now have private farms and farmers (data from Bulgaria is missing). The numbers of agricultural workers and shareholders of cooperative farms are still quite high, especially in the Central European countries. The two main groups of women in agriculture are agricultural workers and farmers on private farms. Household plots are typical of all these countries and the role of women in the work on the household plot is decisive.
Full-time paid employment is common among rural women in Estonia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria. The great social change and privatization of agriculture have in some countries led to agricultural and rural unemployment.

A typical feature of rural areas in all the countries is migration from rural to urban areas, and the subsequent ageing of the rural population. Migration of young, educated, single women is a common trend in most countries, although young men are also eager to move out of rural areas. There is little internal migration in the Baltic countries. In Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, migration from the cities to rural areas is more common than from villages to cities (Table 3), and men migrate from rural areas more often than women. In Lithuania and Croatia, migration from cities to rural areas is also higher than vice versa.

In all the project countries there are more women than men living in rural areas. One of the main reasons is that women have a longer life expectancy. The situation is similar in Austria, yet in Ireland and Finland, there are more men than women living in rural areas. In all CEE countries and in all the reference countries there are more elderly (over 65 years) women living in rural areas than men (Table 4).

4. The social framework of rural women in CEE countries
4. The social framework of rural women in CEE countries
The social and cultural framework has both similarities and differences among the project countries. Cultural differences have their origin in the historical and religious background of each country. Birth rate, family size and infant mortality are decreasing, while the medium age of marriage and of life expectancy at birth, as well as the divorce rate, are increasing. Infant mortality in all CEE countries, with the exception of Slovenia, is still twice as high as it is in Finland or Austria, and life expectancy for men is under 70 years in all the project countries, while it is 72.9 in Austria, 71.3 in Finland and 71.0 in Ireland. Life expectancy for women is on the same level in all the project countries - about 75 years while in Finland and Austria it is nearly 80 years. Slovenia has the highest female life expectancy of the CEE countries at 77.4 years. Mortality is highest in the Baltic countries and in Hungary.
The birth rate is highest in Slovakia (14.9/1 000), but it is also high in Ireland (15.0/1 000). Family size is comparatively small in all the project countries, ranging from 2.6 in the Czech Republic to 4.0 in Estonia and 3.6 in Slovakia. In rural areas families are slightly larger, and farming families have the largest number of children.
Marrying age is over 20 years in all the CEE countries except the Czech Republic, where the medium marrying age for women is 18 years. Divorce rates are highest in the Baltic countries, in the Czech Republic and in Hungary (Table 5).
Comparing the CEE countries with the reference countries, it can be seen that the CEE countries have higher infant mortality and general mortality rates than the reference countries (except Slovenia, which is on the same level with the reference countries), as well as a lower life expectancy than the reference countries. Birth rate, family size and the number of children, however, are on the same level; there are no large families either in CEE countries or in the reference countries.

Comparison data on the standard of living can be taken from the UN Human Development Index (HDI)^6 and Gender Development Index (GDI).^7 The HDI does not contain all of the CEE countries (Slovenia and Croatia are missing and the Czech Republic and Slovakia are combined). However, it confirms the similar results given by the national yearbooks; there are differences between CEE countries and the reference countries in the social indicators of the general level of well-being. The reference countries (Finland, Austria and Ireland) have a higher position in the index than any of the CEE countries, and among the CEE countries, the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary have a higher position than the others.
(^6HDI ranks countries on the level of well-being of their populations, based on a combination of the following indicators: life expectancy at birth (years); adult literacy rate (percent); mean years of schooling; literacy index; schooling index; educational attainment; real GDP/per caput and adjusted real GDP/per caput. UNDP Human Development Report 1994, New York: Oxford University Press.
^7GDI measures inequalities in achievement between women and men. The greater the gender disparity in basic capabilities, the lower a country's GDI compared with its HDI. The indicators used are: share of earned income (percent); life expectancy (years); adult literacy rate (percent); combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio (percent); and HDI rank minus GDI rank. UNDP Human Development Report, 1995, New York: Oxford University Press.)
In teens of gender development in the CEE countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia scored highest. GDI reveals that the situation in gender achievements in all the reference countries is not better than in the CEE countries, as Ireland scored lowest. In Finland, the gender achievements are better than in Austria. At the global level, however, all the project countries and reference countries rank in the top one-third.

One of the main problems in rural areas is the low level of education. In all the project countries rural people are less educated than people in cities. In most of the project countries the level of education for rural women is even lower than that for men (Table 7). Only in Poland and Hungary is the level of education for rural women slightly higher than that of rural men, although in these countries the general level of education in rural areas is the lowest. The proportion of women educated to a high level is higher in all the CEE countries than it is in Austria.
5.1 Women's participation in professional education and training
Professional education and training are concentrated on agriculture. In all the research countries there are many agricultural schools and institutes, and adult education and training in agriculture is available. A common feature in many research countries is the lack of knowledge of home economics, in terms of lack of schools and of advisory, training and extension services in home economics. In Latvia, Slovakia, Croatia and Bulgaria, there are no vocational or professional schools in home economics. The lack of education and training can be seen in nutrition; there is a strong need for education in nutrition, as the diets of rural people are heavy and unhealthy.
Another shortage in the educational systems of most project countries is a lack of education and training in rural entrepreneurship. There are no special schools in rural entrepreneurship in any of the project countries, although a few specialization or adult training courses are organized by agricultural schools, institutes or universities in certain countries (the Baltic countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia). No training courses in rural entrepreneurship specifically for women are organized in any of the project countries.
The main educational needs of rural women are not perceived to be in agricultural production, but in entrepreneurship and home economics at school, institute and university level and in adult education and training. The main needs in adult education, extension and training for rural women expressed by the focal informants are: farm and household management; processing of agricultural products on the farm; village and farm tourism; basics of home economics; healthy nutrition; marketing; accounting; bookkeeping; budgeting; financing; knowledge of taxation; psychology of leadership; and long-term life planning.
In the transition phase that the CEE countries are currently undergoing, the situation and supply of extension services is changing all the time. As former state-run extension services decline, private extension and consultancy services are increasing. The information given by the Focal Informants comes from the years 1992 to 1993, and the situation in the CEE countries has changed since then. The need for market-oriented extension services in the rural areas of in the CEE countries is increasing.
5.2 Women's participation in extension services
All the project countries, with the exception of Hungary, have some extension or advisory services in agriculture, but only a few (Poland, Estonia and Slovenia) have them in home management or home economics (Table 8). Only in Poland are there activities within the extension service organization directed towards women only. In the majority of countries, extension services are provided by the public sector, and only in Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia the private sector is also involved in the provision of extension services.

As a result of the great social and political changes in the project countries the national extension service organizations are changing and continuously developing their services. The priority needs within the extension service system are in home economics (Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Bulgaria have no resources), in agrotourism (in Lithuania, Hungary, Croatia and Bulgaria there are no resources), in rural entrepreneurship (Poland, Hungary and Croatia have no resources) and in environmental issues (Estonia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia have no resources). A more comprehensive and modern attitude to rural development extension is rare; only Hungary and Slovenia are beginning to develop a new, more comprehensive system for rural development.
5.3 Women's participation in organizations
One of the main organizations for rural people, especially for farmers, is the Farmers' Union. There is a Farmers' Union in each of the project countries except Slovenia. Women's membership is possible in all countries apart from the Czech Republic. In Estonia, Latvia and Bulgaria the Union has special activities for women (Table 10).

In addition, there are many other farmers' interest groups and organizations in the project countries. In Lithuania there are the Association for Women Farmers, the Union of Peasants and the Union of Young Farmers, in which women can be members. In Poland there are the Village Housewives' Organization and Agricultural Chambers, where women's membership is possible. In the Czech Republic there are many different organizations, but for male members only. In Slovakia there are the Association of Landowners and the Association of Farmers with women members. In Slovenia there are farm women's groups, in Croatia the Peasants' Union and in Bulgaria the Federation of Agricultural Producers, all with women members.
There are also many other professional organizations in the project countries, in which women can participate. Most of them are very young, founded at the beginning of the 1990s, after the social and political change in the country had started.
The role of rural women in public life is weak. Rural women may become elected to the village board or local government, but they are seldom leaders in public life; most often the role of women is "members only". In the Catholic countries women are not elected to church organizations. Although women are sometimes active at the lower level, there are few women in public life at the national level (Table 11). The Catholic tradition is strong and there is a tendency to believe that a woman's place is in the home and family and not in public life.

As for women's participation, the project countries, along with most of eastern, southern, and the rest of western and central Europe, differ from the Nordic countries, where women are much more active in political and public life. The proportion of women in parliament is very low in the project countries; the average is approximately 10 percent of the members. The situation in some of the reference countries is no better; the proportion of women in parliament is 11 percent in Austria and 8 percent in Ireland. In Finland and Norway the proportion of women members in parliament in 1994 was 39 percent, in Sweden 41 percent and in Denmark 34 percent (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1994).

6. Health care and the social security system for rural women
6.1 Health care and rural women
The national health care system and many social services are well developed in most of the project countries and provided by the municipality or the state or by cooperative and state farms. There are also hospitals, health centres, medical doctors, dentists and school health services in rural areas in most of the countries (Table 12).
There are differences among the countries; Latvia and Lithuania, in particular, have fewer services than the other project countries. Some countries have recently lost their services as a result of the decline of state and cooperative farms, which formerly organized many of the health and social services. There are also shortages and differences among different rural areas. The most severe problems in the supply of services are caused by distances, the lack of telephones, transport and adequate roads, and the price of transport as well as of medicine. Lack of birth control facilities in rural areas was also mentioned. The most general shortage is a lack of maternity clinics in some countries.

Farm and home relief services are organized only in the Czech Republic; employment services are organized in all countries apart from Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria. Maternity leave for rural women is unknown in Latvia and Poland. The bulk of the services are provided in most countries by the state, other providers being the municipalities and the church (especially child care and care for the elderly facilities and services). There is an unequal provision of some social welfare services for rural or farm women in comparison with other women in paid employment.
6.3 Social security benefits and rural women
Although gross national product (GNP) in the project countries is quite low, social security benefits are well provided (Table 14). All the countries provide maternity and child support benefits as well as state disability pensions for the rural population. Home care allowance, unemployment benefit and pension on transfer of the farm to a successor are social benefits more rarely encountered in the project countries. Abortion is legalized in all countries except Poland and Ireland (UN, 1995a).

6.4 Rural women and equality
The equal status of women and men is assured in the legislation of all the project countries (Table 15), but not in the reference countries of Austria and Ireland. In Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria, farm/home relief services are not provided.
In practice, however, women and men are not equal. The most common inequalities mentioned in both CEE countries and the project's reference countries are: discrimination against women in the labour market; inequality in attitudes; in the privatization process; in public life; in incomes; in leadership both at work and in politics (also at parliament level); and in the amount of free time. Equality between the sexes is assured by law in principle, not necessarily in practice.

7. Accommodation and household technology in rural families
7. Accommodation and household technology in rural families
The size of rural dwellings and the number of rooms can be considered satisfactory, but the level of household technology is not very high compared to Austria, Ireland and Finland.
The level of household technology and equipment was usually estimated by the focal informants; statistical information comes only from a few of the project countries. Although the data consists of estimates, some features should be mentioned: the kitchen appliance missing from almost all rural households in the project countries is the dishwasher; the telephone is quite rare in all the countries (often the estimate is about 10 percent of farm households); and freezers and automatic washing machines are also rare. On the other hand, the private car is becoming more and more common (most estimates vary from 30 percent to 50 percent of farm households); and the refrigerator, radio and television are common in most rural families.
Some countries have statistical information on household technology in rural areas. For instance, in Slovakia, the following figures are given: washing machine 22.4 percent; television 38.9 percent; telephone 15.7 percent; and car 36.4 percent.

8. Life on the farm and in the family
8.1 Framework for farm and family life
8.2 Division of labour between men and women in farming families
8. Life on the farm and in the family
A large proportion of rural women are working in agriculture on farms and/or household plots. Although the number of women farmers is decreasing in the reference countries, in many of the CEE countries the process of transition has led to an increase in the number of women farmers.
8.1 Framework for farm and family life
The social and political transitions have resulted in the evolution of many different forms of land property and agricultural production systems, and the number of private farms and farming families is increasing all the time. Private farming has traditionally been largest in Poland, which in 1991 had as many as 3 560 000 private farmers. The average size of private farms varies from country to country and from year to year; in 1991 the largest average farm size was in Estonia (25.4 ha) and the smallest in Croatia (2.8 ha). The private farms in Slovenia are also small (on average 5.9 ha in 1991). In the reference countries farms are usually larger; in Ireland 25.8 ha, in Austria 21.1 ha (1993), although in Finland they are only 12.7 ha (Table 1).
Life on the farm is strongly dependent on the size, economic situation and level of mechanization of the farm, but also on the size of the family, traditional divisions of labour, the level of education of the farming couple and the possibilities the farming couple has both on the farm and outside it (see for example Gutkowska, and Zelazna, 1993; Siiskonen, 1990).
In most of the project countries there are private, cooperative and state farms, although the proportion of private farms is increasing. It is possible for a woman to own a farm, but usually it is owned jointly between men and women, or by the male farmer alone. There are farms managed by women in all the project countries, and the share of farms managed by women varies from 10 to 27 percent.^8
(^8 Estimate given by the Focal Informants.)
8.2 Division of labour between men and women in farming families
The most common division of labour in the Baltic countries and Poland is for both the women and men to work on the farm. In the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, there are different combinations; it is possible for either the wife or the husband to work outside the farm, or for both to work on the farm. In Croatia and Bulgaria men often work outside the farm in paid employment, while women are working on the small farm in non mechanized agriculture.
Entrepreneurship on the farm is quite rare. Yet, in the cases where entrepreneurial activities are found, men are more active than women (data come from Croatia, Bulgaria and Hungary), although there is no data on rural women as entrepreneurs.
In all the project countries, with the exception of Slovenia, rural women work on cooperative and state farms both seasonally and all year round, if work is available. Rural women work as paid labourers on cooperative and state farms in Bulgaria.
The division of labour between women and men inside the farms and families is a mixture of both traditional and modern in the CEE and the reference countries. There are separate activities for men and women, but also activities carried out together. Typical men's activities in CEE and reference countries are mechanical fieldwork and forest work. Typical women's activities are infant care, household work and work in the garden. Tending livestock (milk cows, calves, pigs, poultry and sheep) can be done either by men or by women, depending, for instance, on the size of the farm and opportunities for paid employment outside the farm. Both women and men participate in decision-making on the farm in the northern countries (the Baltic countries and Poland), but decision-making is done mainly by men in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia. There are also some cultural and historical features in the division of labour. For instance, tending horses has been
men's work in Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Croatia, tending sheep is men's work in Slovenia, while tending poultry is considered women's work in Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria.
The division of labour between men and women is similar on cooperative and private farms. Men do mechanical fieldwork, forest work and farm management, while women do manual fieldwork and process agricultural products. The cultural traditions in cattle breeding are stronger on cooperative farms, with men tending the horses and sheep and women the cows and poultry. There are large farms and small farms, full-time farms and part-time farms in the project countries. In the Southern European model, the role of women may be the most demanding, and the working days of rural women are long and heavy. Rural women work in the fields and in the cowshed, in the garden as well as inside the household, without leisure or holidays, and lacking machinery or equipment. The grip of tradition in daily life is difficult to break, and rural women have no time or possibility for education and training or for organizations and public life.

9. Development programmes and research projects for rural women in CEE countries
9. Development programmes and research projects for rural women in CEE countries
There are only a few development programmes for rural women going on in the project countries. In Estonia, the Estonian Farmers' Union has a special training programme for rural women; in Poland the Village Housewives' Training Organization has many programmer for rural women, while the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture (FDPA) has launched the Women in Rural Enterprise Development Programme (WRED). In Slovakia, there are FAO projects on management, while in Slovenia (Trebnje) FAO and the European Commission on Agriculture (ECA) have had a training project on rural entrepreneurship and, most recently, projects organized by the Action Plan for Coordinated Aid to Poland and Hungary (PHARE).
There have been more research projects on rural women in CEE countries. In Latvia there is an ongoing research project on "Rural women in a changing society"; in Lithuania time budget surveys and an interview research on rural women were published in 1990-91. In Poland, three projects were carried out in order to examine the situation of women farmers, rural village households and women's work on the farm; in Slovenia there was a research project on farm families in 1991 and on extension and supplementary activities for farming families in 1994. In Bulgaria, a study on "Life in Town and Village" was undertaken in 1986.

(^9The information included in the Country Profiles comes from the data provided by the Focal Informants. Both the information given in the questionnaire and the separate descriptions are used. The statistical data is primarily for the years 1990 and 1991, with some data from 1992 and 1995. Descriptive data comes from the year 1994. Subjective opinions in some cases are possible. Research data was used wherever possible.)
10.1 Estonia
The Republic of Estonia (45 227 km^2) is the northernmost of the Baltic countries and has 1.6 million inhabitants, of whom 64 percent are Estonian. In terms of religion, most are Lutheran. Population density is 34 persons/km[2]. Independence of the country was restored in 1991. The political system in Estonia remains unstable, as the country is currently experiencing the social and political changes accompanied by democratization, privatization and globalization. GNP part of the farmer USSR per caput in 1993 was US$ 3 040.
Of the 449 000 people (30 percent of the total population) living in the countryside, 233 000 are women (52 percent of the rural population). The women working in paid employment in rural areas are employed as teachers, medical doctors, nurses, shop-assistants or secretaries. Although migration is low, unemployment in rural areas is high, and more women than men migrate from rural areas. Women migrating from rural areas tend to be young, unmarried and well-educated.
The proportion of the population involved in agriculture is 10 percent, and agricultural production accounts for 17 percent of GDP. The number of private farms is increasing and is now about 10 000, while the average farm size is 25.4 ha. There are no state farms left, and instead there are companies and joint-stock firms, which have rented land from the state. There are still 360 cooperative farms in the country. Big dairies and slaughterhouses are still owned by the state. In private agriculture it is common for a husband and wife to own the farm together, but sometimes a woman alone owns the family farm; the proportion of family farms managed by women is about 15 percent. Labour on private farms is divided in a mixture of modern and traditional ways -- decision-making and work in the cowshed are done together, but household work and child care is mainly carried out by women.
The average family size in rural areas is 4.2 people, and the average number of children in rural families is 2.0. The average marrying age in rural areas is 26 years for men and 25 years for women. The divorce rate in rural areas was 4.3/1 000 in 1992.
There are 13 agricultural schools in rural areas as well as schools in home economics and rural entrepreneurship. Adult education and training have also been organized. Rural organizations (education, training, extension, interest groups, etc.) are developing quite rapidly, and rural women have good access to extension services in agriculture and home economics, yet not to more comprehensive rural development or training in village activity, environmental problems or rural entrepreneurship. The Farmers' Union has activities especially for women.
There is a perceived need for rural women to be instructed in new agricultural technologies, home economics and family psychology, starting a business, making a business plan, accounting and loan procedures. Adult training in a market economy, new agricultural technologies and entrepreneurship are also needed.
The state organized a high level of health care and social services and the availability of social benefits is good. Some retired people have problems with nutrition, however, and cannot afford to buy adequate food. There are also problems with communications, as there is a lack of telephones in rural areas and distances are long.
The greatest problems facing rural women in Estonia are unemployment, social problems such as alcoholism in the family, malnutrition, a low level of education, long distances, lack of telephones and lack of knowledge about entrepreneurship. There is a need for training in the use of new technology in agriculture, in psychology of the family, in business planning, in accounting, in financing and in entrepreneurial organizations. More specialized interest in rural women's issues is needed.
10.2 Latvia
The Republic of Latvia is one of the three Baltic countries and has a territory of 64 610 km^2 and 2.6 million inhabitants, of whom only 53.5 percent are Latvian and 35 percent are Russian. The main religion is Lutheranism. The independence of Latvia was restored in 1991. Latvia is now an urbanized country, the rural population of 778 000 (of whom 55 percent work in agriculture) represents 31 percent of the total population. Traditionally, the difference between the agricultural and the rural population has been small, as most rural residents were employed in the agricultural sector. Latvia is seeking the economic and social model most suitable for the nation. GNP per caput in 1993 was US$ 2 030.
Of the total rural population, 53 percent are women. The agricultural population accounts for 16 percent of the total (industry 41 percent), while agricultural production accounts for about 25 percent of GDP. There are 53 000 private farms (half of all cultivated land) and the average farm size is 16.5 ha. The main products are milk, pork, beef, potatoes, grain, sugar beet, vegetables and flax. The greatest problems in agriculture are shortage of technical equipment and credit. Land reform and the reorganization of economic relations and agricultural management are currently underway, and Latvia is privatizing it's agriculture.
Rural women working in paid employment are employed in factories, handicrafts, education, health care, public services and cattle breeding. Rural women in the agricultural sector are working on private farms or on cooperative and state farms, although they have often been the first to lose their jobs. On private farms, women have a heavy workload in nonmechanized activities and little free time. It is typical for private farms to be owned by men and for both the husband and the wife to work on them. Many farm activities are done together, but household work and child care are strictly women's responsibilities. Rural entrepreneurship on private farms has started. Traditionally, the prestige of landowners and farmers was high, yet during the transition period, it has decreased as a result of the shortage of money and machines in private agriculture. Young, unmarried and well-educated women tend to migrate from rural areas to cities.
The family size in rural areas is 3.2 people, and the average number of children in rural families is 1.9. The divorce rate is relatively high at 4.0/1 000 in 1990.
The educational level of rural people (both women and men) is lower than that of the urban population. There are schools of agriculture and farming, but none for home economics. Some adult education and training are available, but training in home economics, finance and entrepreneurship is particularly needed. There are extension and advisory services in agronomy, forestry, bookkeeping, animal breeding, building and machinery, but Latvian rural women have no extension or advisory services in home management or home economics, and only a few in agrotourism, rural entrepreneurship and rural development.
There is a farmers' union in the country and women's membership is possible. The farmers' union has activities specifically for women, but village activities are unknown and there are no village boards in Latvia.
There are many deficiencies in social services in rural areas; there are no maternity clinics and there is no maternity leave for women farmers. Telephones are rare and there are also problems of nutrition. The opinion of the Focal Informants is that changes in the social and political structure have led to the destruction of the national health care system for the rural population.
In regards to women's legal status, Latvian women and men are equal, but traditional inequality can be seen in society; few women work in the upper echelons of administration, and the proportion of women in parliament is only 12 percent, while more women than men are unemployed. Women have a higher level of education than men, but have lower posts in society.
The greatest problems of Latvian rural women are economic and social -- many face the choice between hard manual work or unemployment.
The most urgent needs for rural women in Latvia are employment, education, training and advisory services, especially in home economics, home management and new job openings. There are inequalities between the sexes, one example being in the amount of free time which men have while women do all the household work.
10.3 Lithuania
The Republic of Lithuania is the southernmost of the three Baltic countries and has a territory of 65 301 km^2 and 3.7 million inhabitants. The majority (79.6 percent) of the population are Lithuanian, the remainder being Russian and Polish. The majority of the population are Roman Catholic. Lithuania became part of the former USSR after the Second World War, but was the first to give a declaration of the restoration of independence in 1990. The greatest problems the country is facing are economic and social: there is an economic recession in the country; the country has lost its eastern markets for agricultural and industrial products; the standard of living has declined after the political changes; and the crime rate is high. GNP per caput was US$ 1 310 in 1993.
Over 1 million Lithuanians live in rural areas (32 percent of the population). 17.5 percent of the population work in agriculture and the proportion of agriculture in GDP is 27 percent. The main line of production in agriculture is animal husbandry. The number of private farmers is increasing, as both restitution of the property of former owners and the privatization of the land property of state and collective farms is underway. In 1993 there were 111 000 private farms with an average size of 8.8 ha and 5 900 private farmers. In addition, there are 404 000 private subsidiary plots with an average size of 2-3 ha and 121 000 plot owners, while there are 209 000 shareholders in cooperative farms. The main problems in rural areas are related to the current agrarian reform; people are motivated to start private farming, but they do not have enough resources. Rural people have also lost many of the social and communal services maintained by big state and collective farms.
The proportion of women in the total labour force is high at 48 percent. However, forms of occupational sex segregation can be seen. In rural areas women are mainly involved in unskilled work in the fields, cowsheds, pig or poultry farms, or in social services. A special problem in rural areas is that the privatization of state and collective farms has led to the loss of the social services they supplied. If kindergartens are closed, it is difficult for women to have paid employment outside the home. In 1992, the birth rate in Lithuania was 14.3/1 000. The infant mortality rate in rural areas has been increasing over the last few years, going from 15.811 000 in 1991 to 17.4/1 000 in 1992. The average family size in rural areas was 3.2 percent in 1989. The divorce rate was 4.1/1 000 in 1991.
There is a great difference in the age structure of men and women in rural areas; in the oldest age group (over 65 years) there are many more women than men. The level of education is far lower in rural than in urban areas, and the educational level of rural women is lower than that of rural men. Although there is now more migration from cities to rural areas than vice versa, young and unmarried women have a tendency to move from rural areas to cities.
Now that private farming is possible, it is usual for husband and wife to own the family farm jointly and to work on it together. It is typical for women to work on family farms, but rural women may also have full-time or seasonal work in agricultural companies. On family farms, both spouses work in the cowshed, but women do more household work and child care than do men.
There are vocational schools and colleges of agriculture for both boys and girls, and there is also some education in home economics and handicrafts in vocational schools. In winter there are some adult education and training courses organized in agricultural schools and colleges. However, rural women need adult education and training in farm management, economics and in home economics.
There are agricultural extension services in Lithuania in marketing and distribution of products, processing products, management of private farms and technology. There are also various advisory organizations in agriculture, but there are no extension organizations in home management, home economics or consumer education.
The national health care system for rural people is deficient. There are no district hospitals, child health centres, maternity clinics or pharmacies in rural areas.
There are different interest groups for the farming population; the Farmers' Union, the Women Farmers' Association, the Union of Peasants and the Union of Young Farmers. However, men are more active in political and public life than women; local governments are primarily occupied by men, and the proportion of women in parliament is only 8 percent. The newly formed Association of Women Farmers is a promising development in rural Lithuania.
The greatest problems for rural women are economic and caused by unemployment or a heavy work load. Other problems are the lack of district hospitals, maternity clinics and pharmacies in rural areas and the fact that transportation costs to regional centres are high. It is also problematic that there are no extension services in home economics, home management or in new job opportunities such as rural entrepreneurship or agrotourism. In addition, discrimination against women in employment persists. The transition period in society has been particularly difficult for women because of the threat of unemployment and the diminishing social services (such as kindergartens).
The primary needs of Lithuanian rural women are the creation of jobs in nonagricultural activities in rural areas, the organization of national health care services in rural areas, education, and the revival of social and cultural services.
10.4 Poland
Poland is the largest of the project countries with a territory of 312 683 km^2 and a population of 38.4 million. The rural population is 14.7 million (38 percent of the total). Poland is dominated by one nationality, one language and one religion (Catholicism). The main problems of Poland are economic, but also political. Unemployment, instability of the political system and poor infrastructure are problems. Unemployment of women was 51 percent in 1990 and 53 percent in 1995 (E. Dec. 1995). The productivity of the national economy is low -- the GNP per caput was US$ 2 270 in 1993.
Poland has always had a system of predominantly peasant farms; the number of private farms is now 2.1 million with an average size of 7.1 ha. In 1991, the total number of private farmers was 3.6 million, of whom 1.8 million were women. The proportion of people working in agriculture is 29 percent, while the proportion of agricultural production in GDP is 6.5 percent (industry 52 percent). There are 7.3 million women living in rural areas (50 percent of the total rural population); 2.3 million women are economically active in agriculture, and 91 percent of the women working in agriculture work on private farms, the rest on state and cooperative farms (K. Gutkowska and K. Zelazna, 1993).
Rural women not employed in agriculture work in services and small industries; it is rare for either the wife or the husband to have entrepreneurial activities on the farm. One in five private farms is operated by women. The farms operated by women fall into three categories: women whose husband and sons work outside the farm; women running the farm after the death or disability of male household members; and young professionally skilled women managers. Of the female-headed farms, 10 percent are one-person farms and one in four women farmers has reached personable age. Farms owned by women are smaller than the average.
In farming families women are often responsible for the household and family life, and even for farm production (E. Dec. 1995). The division of labour in farming families is traditional and has patriarchal features; men take care of mechanical fieldwork, women do the household work, work with cows and take care of children. The average family size in rural areas is 3.5 and in farming families 3.9 persons. The average number of children in rural families is 1.6. Rural households do not have all the modern amenities; they seldom have piped hot water, a dishwasher or a telephone. However, the washing machine, the refrigerator and television are common in rural households. There is a significant predominance of women from the older age groups in rural areas. For instance, in the age group over 70 years, there are 134 women for every 100 men.
The educational level of rural people is much lower than that of urban people, while the educational level of rural women is slightly higher than that of rural men. In the 1960s more men than women migrated from rural areas, yet at present more women (young and educated) than men are migrating. Because unemployment is increasing in urban areas, part-time farmers, however, are returning to their farms. Some 35 percent of the rural population work outside agriculture. Unemployment in rural areas is lower than in the cities, but it is still relatively high; in 1993 it was 10.8 percent in rural areas (13.7 percent in the whole country) and 12.5 percent for rural women (15.2 percent women in the whole country).
There are agricultural schools, schools of agricultural technology and agricultural universities in Poland. In some schools specialization in home economics is possible. Adult education is not well developed, and rural women have educational needs in husbandry, horticulture, home economics, food processing and nutrition, small business management, accounting and budgeting. There are extension services in Poland in agriculture, home economics and agricultural economics. However, there are no extension workers in environmental issues, agrotourism or rural entrepreneurship. Agricultural Extension Centers have organized business training programmes in rural tourism.
There are many organizations for rural people, including the Farmers' Union, the Village Housewives' Organization and the Agricultural Chambers. These organizations have special activities for women, but more men than women participate in public life and organizations. Village boards, municipal boards, cooperative boards, and local and national government bodies are occupied primarily by men.
The main problems in rural areas are low income levels, difficult access to credit for women, unemployment, lack of services, and a low level of infrastructure, such as a lack of telephones. Moreover, social security services and benefits are lower in agriculture, there are no support services for children or elderly people in rural areas, there is no maternity leave for women farmers, there are few recreational and cultural activities in rural areas, the working days (especially on private farms) are long, and the health of rural women is poor. Women's participation in decision-making in political, economic and social life is low. One of the main problems in Polish agriculture is the migration of young women from rural areas and the young male farmer's difficulty in finding a wife. Another problem is the lack of mechanization in agriculture. Formally men and women are equal in society, but women do not have equal access to the privatization process that is going on.
Agriculture can no longer absorb the increasing numbers of unemployed people and small-scale entrepreneurship needs to be developed. The most urgent needs of rural women in Poland are a better rural infrastructure, more and better services and a better social security system. Adult education and training, positive rural role models, and women's increased self-esteem and greater political participation are also needed.
10.5 Czech Republic
The Czech Republic, together with Slovakia, is one of the youngest independent democracies in Europe, born in 1993. There are 10.3 million inhabitants living in the Czech Republic, the majority of them Czechs, Moravians and Silesians, of whom 39 percent belong to the Roman Catholic Church and an equal number have no religious affiliation. The Czech Republic is an industrialized society and the share of manufacturing industry in GNP is over 60 percent. A typical feature of the society is that 30 percent of the economically active population are internal migrants. The proportion of women in the labour force is relatively high at 47.6 percent. In 1993, GNP per caput was US$ 2 730, while the unemployment rate was low at only 3.9 percent for both the country as a whole as well as in rural areas. The main problems of the country are caused by the transition to a market economy as well as ecological problems in industrial areas.
The proportion of the labour force engaged in agriculture is only 8.1 percent, while agricultural production accounts for 5.6 percent of the GDP. Highly intensive land cultivation is typical of Czech agriculture. All possible forms of landownership can be found; half of the land is owned by cooperative farms (in 1 298 cooperatives), one-quarter by private farms (about 47 000 farms) and about one-tenth by state farms (173 state farms). A process of privatization including the return and restitution of property, the denationalization of state property and the transformation of cooperatives -- is on-going.
2.6 million people (25 percent of the population) live in rural areas, half of whom are women. There are wide variations in the age structure of rural women and men. In the active age group there are more men than women in rural areas, but in the older age groups there is a majority of women. There are only 207 000 men over 65 years in rural areas, as against 375 000 women. The educational level of the rural population is lower than that of urban residents, and the educational level of men is higher than that of women in both rural and urban settings. Migration from rural areas to urban areas is higher than vice versa, and more women than men are migrating. The average age of marriage for rural men is 22 years, and for rural women 18 years.
Rural women working in sectors other than agriculture tend to work full time. Women working on the farm are seldomly engaged in entrepreneurial activities. On family farms men make the decisions, men and women work with the animals and women work in the household. The telephone is still rare in rural households, but half of the families have a car of their own. Rural people have heavy meals and guidance on better nutrition is needed. The national health care system functions in rural areas and the level of social services and social benefits is high. Special problems in rural areas are the scant provision of shops, services and cultural activities.
There are vocational schools, secondary level institutes and agricultural universities in the Czech Republic. The proportion of girls in agricultural schools is more than half, on the secondary level 44 percent and in the agricultural universities 37 percent. Many kinds of adult education services are available to rural people.
The main educational needs of rural women are in healthy nutrition, the legal and tax system, entrepreneurship, accounting, bookkeeping, using computers and psychological and sociological knowledge. There are no special extension services in home economics or home management in the country.
There are many organizations for rural and agricultural people (the Union of Agricultural Entrepreneurs, the Union of Land Owners, the Union of Cooperative Workers and the Agrarian Chamber), but women do not actively participate.
The main problems of rural areas are depopulation, few and decreasing services, and the lack of cultural activities. A special problem for rural women is a heavy work load, lack of free time and inequality in leisure compared to men. There are no extension or advisory services in home economics for rural or farming families. A special problem in rural areas, as well as for the country as a whole, is women's low participation in politics and public life.
The priority needs of rural women are a better service network, increased activity in public life and organizations, and education and training in home economics.
10.6 Slovakia
Slovakia was also born in 1993, and has a territory of 49 036 km^2 and 5.3 million inhabitants, of whom the majority are Slovakian (85.7 percent). Like most young democracies, Slovakia is politically unstable and unemployment is a problem (at 14.4 percent 1993), especially in remote rural areas. GNP per caput in 1993 was US$ 1 930 and inflation is high (24 percent in 1993 and 12 percent in 1994). Slovakia is, however, a predominantly industrial rather than agricultural society.
There are 2.3 million people (44 percent of the population) living in rural areas. Unemployment in rural areas has increased and caused serious problems in particular areas, because heavy industry has decreased and agricultural production is in a transition phase. There are differences among rural areas; "central villages" have a better infrastructure, including provision of services, than other rural areas.
The agricultural labour force is no more than 9.7 percent of the economically active population. The characteristic feature of Slovakian agriculture is a high degree of concentration, outdated machinery, and a high consumption of materials and energy. By the end of 1993, there were 1 004 cooperative farms with an average size of 1 790 ha, 17 630 private farms with an average size of 10 ha, and 135 state farms with an average size of 1 243 ha. Most of the agricultural labour force work on cooperative farms. The number of agricultural workers in 1994 was estimated at 264 000, of whom approximately 80 000 were women.
Altogether there are 1 174 000 women living in rural areas. Full-time work is common for rural women when they are employed. Most often rural women in paid employment are agricultural workers or employed in administration. The wage level of women in agriculture is lower than that of men and lower than that of women in other sectors of the economy in rural areas, but higher than that of urban women. The proportion of women in the labour force has always been high in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In Slovakia, the proportion was 46 percent in 1991 (in the Czech Republic it was 47.6 percent). However, inside the family the division of labour is traditional; in spite of paid employment outside the home, women take care of household work. The level of household technology is not very high; freezers, washing machines, dishwashers and telephones are rare in rural households. In addition, the diets are unhealthy.
The age structure of men differs from that of women in rural areas; men constitute the majority in the active age group (15 to 64 years), and women in the older age group (over 65 years). The educational level of rural women is lower than that of rural men. More women than men migrate from rural areas to cities. The average family size in rural areas is 3.6 people and the estimated average number of children in rural families is two. The average marrying age of men in rural areas is 24.2 years, and 21.3 years for women.
As well as an agricultural university, Slovakia has many agricultural schools and secondary level schools of agriculture. Adult education for rural people is organized by the agricultural university and the forestry university of the country. Adult training for rural women is needed in home economics, nutrition, farm management and small business entrepreneurship.
There are agricultural extension services in legislation, finance, taxation, trade, marketing and management of enterprises, but none in home economics or home management.
There are many active farmers' interest groups, and occasionally women hold important positions on village and municipal boards.
The main problems of rural women are unemployment or the double workload that results from the traditional division of labour inside the family, the lack of extension services, the lack of knowledge about home economics and nutrition, and the shortage of voluntary women's associations.
The most urgent needs of rural women are an improvement in the general level of education and knowledge in home economics.
10.7 Hungary
Hungary has a territory of 93 000 km^2 and about 10 million inhabitants. In addition, there are 3.5 million Hungarians living outside the borders. Hungary has also experienced great social and political changes since the collapse of the former USSR. The most important problems of the country are economic and social; a budget deficit, unemployment (at 12 percent, in 1994) and difficulties in establishing a market economy. GNP per caput in 1993 was higher than in many other CEE countries at US$ 3 400.
Rural areas vary across the parts of the country. Geographically, four areas can be distinguished: the central region, which is the most urban area around Budapest; the Great Hungarian Plain, the most agricultural area; Northern Hungary, suffering from the collapse of the former USSR for heavy industry located in the area; and Transdanubia, the most developed area of the country with foreign investments and a low level of unemployment.
Some 16 percent of the total population work in agriculture. The proportion of women in the agricultural labour force is 38 percent. The climate and soil conditions in Hungary are excellent for agricultural production. Before privatization and the restoration of land property only 7 percent of the land was in private ownership; 72 percent was held by cooperatives and 21 percent by state farms. At present, 40 to 50 percent of the land is private. There are approximately 120 000 private farms with an average of 15 ha and about 90 000 full-time farmers. There are 1 600 cooperative farms (average size 2 000 ha) and about 150 state farms. The number of agricultural workers is 467 000. In addition, about half of all Hungarians own a household plot. The majority of private farmers are part-time farmers, while cooperatives are characterized by full-time employment.
About 4 million people (38 percent of the population) live in rural villages; 51 percent of them are women. Villages near towns and holiday resorts have more opportunities than remote areas. Rural women work in the household, on cooperative farms and in administrative, commercial and unskilled work in the state sector and in agricultural support work on family farms (L. Kulcsár, 1995). In the former socialist system, women were almost fully employed or they experienced hidden unemployment, while women now suffer from serious unemployment. Rural women have lost work especially in agricultural cooperatives, state farms, local industries and local government institutes such as kindergartens, schools and services (L. Kulcsár, 1995). Unemployment in Hungary is basically a rural problem; 60 percent of all the unemployed people live in rural areas (L. Kulcsár, 1995). Rural women have always commuted less than men, but the local jobs have always offered them lower wages. Rural
entrepreneurship is slowly increasing.
About 15 to 20 percent of family farms are managed by women who are widows or divorced. The wage level of women working in agriculture is lower than that of men, of women in other sectors in rural areas, and of urban women. Village women try to produce a significant proportion of the food (vegetables, fruits, poultry and even pigs) for family consumption on the household plots.
On family farms the division of labour is gender-segregated; almost all work is either mainly men's work (such as fieldwork, farm management, tending horses and sheep, decision-making in farming and marketing the products) or women's work (such as milking cows, tending the cattle, pigs and poultry, processing agricultural products, household work and decision-making in the household, infant and child care and work in the garden).
The educational level of rural women is slightly higher than that of rural men. However, there is some illiteracy both in rural and in urban areas. Migration from rural areas to cities and towns is slightly lower than vice versa, but men and women migrate in more or less equal numbers. The average family size in rural areas is 2.9 people, and in farming families about four, while the average number of children in rural families is about one per family. The average marrying age for rural men is 24 years, and for rural women 21 years.
There are agricultural schools and there have also been schools of home economics in Hungary. For adults, there are some short courses organized by county level job centres. The perceived educational needs of rural women are in home management, nutrition, entrepreneurship, financing and leadership. Adult training in long-term planning is needed. There are not yet any extension services in private farming or home economics. Problem points in household technology include a lack of telephones.
There are deficiencies in the national health care system as well. There are no district hospitals, health centres, maternity clinics or private clinics in rural areas, and there is no organized family planning for rural families. There are no employment services nor national pensions for rural people. Women hardly participate in political life or local decision-making, and only 7 percent of the members in the first freely elected parliament were women. On the other hand, the farmers' union is very active and women's membership is possible.
The main problems of rural women in Hungary are unemployment, a low level of education and social security, social and economic inequality, low level of participation in local decision-making, a lack of knowledge in home economics and a lack of self-confidence.
The priority needs are for adult education, training and extension services and non-governmental organizations for rural women wishing to enter local politics.
10.8 Slovenia
Slovenia was the first of the new independent countries born from Yugoslavia in 1991. It has an area of 20 256 km^2 and about 2 million inhabitants, of whom 88 percent are Slovenian, most of them Catholic. The political system of Slovenia is a parliamentary democracy. A multiparty democracy has, however, still to be developed and managerial skills for a market economy acquired.
Half of the population live in rural areas. There are 552 300 rural women and 525 300 rural men. The ratio between the rural and the urban population has been fairly stable since 1988 as a result of migration from the countryside coming to an end and a stagnation in the move of city residents to suburban settlements. Most of the Slovenian countryside has a fair level of basic communications and services. The main problems in rural areas are related to low incomes in agriculture (farms are small, the average size is 5.9 ha) and the lack of other income-earning opportunities. The lower the income, the less developed the infrastructure. Rural tourism seems to be the economic activity through which natural resources, cultural heritage and local food can be utilized and new jobs for rural people created. Over 50 percent of all rural women work in agriculture. Those who work in paid employment are usually employed in factories, shops and schools.
The average size of farming families is 3.7 people, and the average number of children in rural families is 1.4. The average marrying age for rural men is 26 years and for rural women 24 years (A. Barbic, 1993).
The proportion of agriculture in GDP in 1992 was 5 percent. There are 157 000 private farms, and about 574 000 private farmers working in agriculture. Women make up 50.4 percent of the agricultural labour force. The number of state farms is 202, and the average size 428 ha. Slovenian farms are small. An increase in plant production and a decrease in animal production can be seen. The prestige of farming has been increasing lately, but less so for women farmers due to their economic dependence on the husband and the poor social and cultural infrastructure in rural areas. Usually both the husband and wife work on the farm, or the wife works on the farm and the husband outside the farm in paid employment. The proportion of farms managed by women is high, at 27.2 percent.
The educational level of rural women is lower than that of rural men. There are vocational and secondary schools of agriculture in the country, and also university faculties of agriculture. In addition, there are secondary schools of home economics and technical schools specializing in rural entrepreneurship, as well as adult education and training for the rural population. There are also agricultural extension services in agricultural technologies, mechanization, agricultural economics and rural family and supplementary activities, but none in environmental management. Slovenian rural women have educational needs in entrepreneurship, planning, management and decision-making, financing and leadership.
Rural households are relatively well-equipped and the national health care system is also available for rural people.
Under the constitution, women and men are treated equally. In order to promote the role of women in society and to secure the rights of women, the Government Office for Women's Politics was founded in 1992. There is no farmers' union in Slovenia, and all the organizations in rural areas are dominated by men.
The main problem of farm women is low incomes in agriculture. In addition, women farmers are seldom recognized as farm managers even on part-time farms. Another problem is that women's realm has traditionally been limited to the household and the farm, while participation in public life has been reserved for men. The problems of all rural women are economic dependence on the husband, social isolation, lack of professional training, lack of information and lack of free time.
The priority needs of rural women are economic independence, relevant training for supplementary activities and increased participation in public life.
10.9 Croatia
The Republic of Croatia was born in 1991 after the collapse of Yugoslavian socialism. Croatia has an area of 56 538 km^2 and a population of 4.8 million, of whom a majority (78.1 percent) are Croat, and a minority (12.2 percent) are Serbian. Of the total population, 76.5 percent belong to the Roman Catholic Church. Croatia has different problems than the other project countries, such as civil conflict and a high number of refugees. In addition, Croatia has high inflation and economic problems and the country is politically unstable. In 1993 GNP per caput in 1993 was US$ 2 665.
Almost half of the population (45.7 percent) live in rural areas, which are less developed than the cities. Among the rural areas a polarization can be seen, with the villages closer to urban industrial centres being far more developed than peripheral areas. Approximately 4 to 5 percent of all the rural dwellings have been completely devastated.
The percentage of women economically active in agriculture is 43.8 percent. Family farming is the main form of agricultural production. There are 533 000 farms with an average size of 2.8 ha holding two-thirds of total agricultural land. There are 150 700 private farmers and 77 000 agricultural workers (28 percent of them are women). The number of private farmers in 1991 was 91 000, of which women constituted approximately 60 000, and 447 state farms. Because the average farm size is small, there is a strong tendency for farmers to earn their income from more than one source. Approximately 34 percent of all the private farm owners work off the farm and only periodically on the farm with the family members. The socioeconomic and political status of farmers is low.
Rural women outside agriculture work in the textile or food industries and in education as teachers. Rural women are mostly on the margins of public and political life. The low social status of rural women is a reflection of the prejudices still existing against women, submissiveness to the traditional family hierarchy, insufficient education, economic dependence on men and also women's own inertia. The position of women farmer's is by far the worst as they work on their small holdings, which are poorly equipped, while the men are usually employed of farm.
The average family size in rural areas is 3.5 people and the estimated average number of children in rural families is 1.3. The level of household technology is not high and the rural infrastructure has some deficiencies; there are few telephones, health centres and dentists in rural areas although the national health care system is relatively good and functioning.
The educational level of rural women is lower than that of rural men and there is some illiteracy; in rural areas 8 percent of women and 5 percent of men are illiterate. There are agricultural schools and high schools and also university faculties of agriculture in Croatia. There are, however, no schools in home economics or rural entrepreneurship and only a few courses in adult education. There are perceived educational needs of rural women in modern agricultural technology, home economics, nutrition and entrepreneurship. Rural women also need training in processing agricultural products, marketing and selling products, village tourism and making food. Agricultural extension services are deficient and there are none in home economics, environmental issues, agrotourism or rural entrepreneurship.
There are many farmers' interest groups in Croatia, but they do not yet have any activities aimed at women. Political participation at the local and national levels is in the hands of men. The low political participation of women reflects their unfavourable position, and in spite of their legally proclaimed equality, women seldom appear in political life. The proportion of women in parliament is only 5 percent, and the situation is no better in local governments, with only 4.6 percent of the members of country assemblies and 3.7 percent of municipal councils being women. Women are more active at informal levels which are closer to their everyday problems.
The status of women within the family depends on many factors, such as the level of education, employment outside the family and the age of the spouse. Younger married couples are more democratic, but in rural areas and in less developed regions there are strong traditional beliefs about the role of women (as mother and housewife) and, regardless of the hard work she does on the farm, the help of her husband in child care and housework is minimal, and the woman is in a subordinate position relative to the man.
The main problems of rural women are their low educational level, the traditional position of women inside the family, the low social status of rural women, and their exclusion from the public life of local communities.
The priority needs of rural women are for social and cultural activities, development projects with women's involvement, and special training programmes in agricultural technology, economics and home economics.
10.10 Bulgaria
Bulgaria has an area of 110 994 km^2 with 8.5 million inhabitants. After the collapse of the former USSR, great social and political changes have taken place, and a process of privatization of land property is now on-going.
The main problems of Bulgaria are economic and political. The Bulgarian state has problems of foreign debt, recession, high levels of inflation and unemployment, the slow progress of land reform and privatization, and a lack of knowledge and experience regarding a market economy.
There are about 2.9 million people living in rural areas, and about half of them are women. The role of agriculture in the economy is important. The share of the agricultural labour force is 20 percent and agricultural production accounts for 16 percent of the total production. The main employment opportunities for women in rural areas are in agriculture, and they work full-time, part-time and seasonally in cooperatives and state farms. Whereas the level of mechanization on the state and cooperative farms used to be high, privatization has brought a lot of problems to the small farms. The prestige of both women and men farmers is low.
A special feature of Bulgarian society is the migration from cities to rural areas, which is much higher than migration in the opposite direction.
The educational level of women in rural areas is lower than that of men and there is some illiteracy. There are secondary and high schools in agriculture, but none in home economics or rural entrepreneurship. There is also some adult education and training. The perceived educational needs of rural women are in home economics, nutrition, entrepreneurship, planning, management and decision-making, financing and leadership. There are some extension services in setting up a business, but none in home economics.
The national health care system is deficient in rural areas as there are no district hospitals or dentists, and the distances to existing services are long. Employment services for rural people are also lacking.
There is a farmers' union in Bulgaria with special activities aimed at women. Women have a secondary, subordinate role in society compared with men. In the parliament, only 13 percent of all representatives are women. At the beginning of the transition towards the market economy women lost more jobs than men. In both rural and urban areas women have a higher unemployment rate than men, while men have a relatively higher monthly salary than women.
The main problems in Bulgarian rural areas include the land reform and the large number of landowners without the necessary capital. Special problems of rural women are unemployment, a low level of education and a lack of self-confidence.
The priority needs of rural women in Bulgaria are increased participation in entrepreneurship and public decision-making.

11. Main problems and priority needs in CEE countries
11. Main problems and priority needs in CEE countries
The greatest problems of rural women mentioned by the focal informants in the participating countries are: unemployment, especially in the transition phase; declining or low incomes; economic problems (especially in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria) caused by social and political changes; low level of education; lack of extension and knowledge in home economics, home management and entrepreneurship; heavy workload both in paid employment and at home; lack of free time and inequality in free time compared to men; social problems such as the increasing consumption of alcohol (especially by men); inadequate and distant or diminishing health care and social services; lack of household services and equipment; unhealthy nutrition and poor health; deficiencies in the rural infrastructure; social isolation; lack of social and cultural activities in villages; the low social status of rural women and the tradition that women are outsiders in public life; the
traditional division of labour inside families and women's economic dependence on men; women's lack of self-confidence in their potential (mentioned especially by Hungary and Bulgaria); and depopulation of the rural areas, especially the migration of young rural women.
The priority needs mentioned by the focal informants were: paid employment and economic independence; education and training in entrepreneurship, home economics, home management and the mother's role; revival of social and cultural services and activities; better infrastructure and social security systems; increased participation of women in public life; development and training programmes for rural women and families; training in adaptation to the changing social circumstances; better cooperation inside the family; and women's involvement in rural development projects at the local level.
The main problems of rural women can be divided into four main categories economic, social, family level and individual. Most of the problems are connected to the social and political change and transition taking place in the countries. For many rural women and families, the transition from one system to another has meant increased economic problems and a loss of paid labour and unemployment. In private agriculture the main problem is low income levels. For many rural women the economic problem is dependence on their husband's income.
Social problems are connected with economic problems; unemployment and a lack of income are usually connected with malnutrition, illness and alcoholism. In many CEE countries, the social infrastructure in the villages was connected with the agricultural production system; giving up the state and cooperative farms led to the loss of social services such as kindergartens as well as health and maternity care provided by the state and cooperative farms. In addition, many cultural activities were connected with the state and cooperative farms and have been lost during the transition.
Inequality between the sexes in decision-making can also be seen as a social problem. There is a male-dominated decision-making culture at both local and national levels in the CEE countries. The proportion of women in public life is very low.
There is also a-social problem in education and training in rural areas in the CEE countries; women are less educated with respect to the needs of emerging markets and the level of education in rural areas is low.
At the family level, the main problems are in the division of labour inside the household. Often women have a heavy workload and less free time than men. The level of household technology is low and it increases the work burden on women. Lack of knowledge in nutrition and home economics as well as lack of income often mean malnutrition at the family level.
Individual problems are usually economic and social, and there is a lack of self-esteem and self-reliance. Rural women seldom have positive rural role models, and young girls prefer to move to towns and cities. Lack of interest in politics and public issues is also a problem at the individual level.
A vicious circle can be seen at both the personal and the social levels; no income or money, low levels of education and training, combined with economic dependence, tends to restrict women's possibilities to start entrepreneurial activities or to find other income-earning positions where job opportunities are becoming scarce. The lack of economic activities means that there are no social services in rural areas. The vicious circle ought to be broken and a new start made. Local rural development projects, which start by building self-reliance, personal abilities, entrepreneurship, social responsibility and interest in local development, are the priority needs in CEE countries. Unemployed women ought to be seen as a resource and not as a problem.

12. Summary and conclusions
12. Summary and conclusions
The transition period is bringing about changes in the social and political system, the system of land property, social organizations, social security and legislation, organization of production and employment, education and everyday life. The macro-level changes have their effects on the situation of rural people and rural women.
Although all the project countries are different, some generalizations concerning the situation of rural women in the first half of the 1990s can be made:
1. Women make up the majority of the rural population in CEE countries, and represent the oldest age groups (over 65 years old).
2. The role of agriculture as a source of employment is decreasing in rural areas.
However, the largest group of rural women in the project countries are women farmers in Poland. The number of private women farmers is increasing with the privatization of agricultural production in some countries, while the agricultural population and the number of agricultural workers are decreasing. Many rural women are working occasionally in less demanding jobs or only in the household.
3. One of the main problems of rural women confront in CEE countries is unemployment combined with a lack of diversification in employment; in many countries unemployment of rural women is more common than that of rural men.
4. Social and political changes in CEE countries have been difficult; many rural people -
- especially women -- have lost their jobs, as well as the social and cultural services formerly available in the village. Unemployment is followed by social problems such as alcoholism, malnutrition, crimes and illness.
5. The level of education is low in rural areas, and rural women are less educated than rural men. Education, training and extension in home economics, nutrition and rural entrepreneurship are particularly needed.
6. The participation and interest of women in public life and in political decision-making is low at both local and national levels.
7. The family size and number of children is relatively small. Inside families, household activities, household management and infant and child care are women's responsibilities. The level of household technology is quite low.
8. Rural women suffer from a lack of positive role models, and young girls have a strong tendency to migrate from rural areas.
9. Lack of self-confidence and self-awareness are typical of rural women.
This survey should trigger national activities aimed at improving the situation of rural women. Toward this end, rural development programmes for women are needed, and Action Plans in the countries should note the following:
1. The countries differ in regards to the social situation and status of rural women, and thus national action plans are needed which take into account such differences.
2. The speed of transition among countries varies, and thus economic opportunities in regards to proposed activities, plans and programmes, are needed.
3. There are different women's groups in rural areas -- old and young, unemployed and economically active, women farmers and salary workers, and women living in central and in marginal areas -- and thus different activities for the different women's groups are needed.
4. Only rural women were included in the survey; but men must not be forgotten in rural development programmes.
5. The CEE countries included in the project have different social, cultural, historical and geographical situations, and thus Action Plans and follow-up activities should take such differences into account. However, benchmarking and comparative follow-up studies should be carried out.
6. The results of the research represent the situation of rural women in the region during the first half of the 1990s, and thus a follow-up study should be carried out to examine current changes.

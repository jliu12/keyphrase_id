<title>Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study: FAO Outlook Study on Wood Based Panels Production, Consumption and Trade in the Asia Pacific Region 1996 to 2010</title>
<section>1</section>
INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects.
Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

1. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The FAO Forestry Sector Outlook Study of the Asia Pacific region represents the first unified look at the forestry sector, its status, trends and prospects, since the previous FAO outlook study for the region carried out in 1976.
Core elements of the study will include status, trends and future prospects scenarios on:
· forest resources and wood resources outside forests
· consumption and trade in industrial wood products and wood energy
· forest industries and non-wood products and services
· environment, protected areas and conservation
· implications for future industrial raw material supplies
· sustainability dimensions of forestry development
· implications for policy, institutions and action, including investment
The wood based panel study is one of the key core components of the complete Outlook Study, and is the subject of this report, in which we have attempted:
· to measure the status and trends in the production, consumption and trade of wood based panels in the Asia Pacific region over the period 1990 to 1995.
· to describe the main determining factors driving the consumption and trade in wood based panel products within the Asia Pacific region.
· to study the continued availability of raw materials for wood based panels within the region, including large and small diameter roundwood, forest and mill residues, and residues from plantations and agricultural plants.
· To suggest various scenarios for the future growth in consumption and trade in wood based panels within the region up to the year 2010.

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2.1. Current Consumption Patterns
2.2. Future Consumption Projections
2.1. Current Consumption Patterns
The economies of the major Asia Pacific countries (with the exception of Japan) have been growing at between 5% and 10% per year for about the past ten years, and this has been clearly reflected in the regional wood based panel consumption which grew at over 10% per year between 1990 and 1995, from 27.3 million m³ to 44.4 million m³ per year.
The pattern of growth by country was not consistent however and included zero consumption growth performances from Singapore, the countries of Indo China, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and a growth rate of only 2% per year in Japan, the major wood based panel importer in the region. To offset these, the consumption in China grew by about 20% per year throughout the period, and Taiwan Province of China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines all registered consumption growth rates of 10% to over 12% per year.
The pattern of growth between the various panels was also very variable with medium density fibreboard (MDF) being the star performer with an overall growth rate of 30% per year between 1990 and 1995, the highest sub-regional growth rate being in South East Asia at 40% per year, followed by North Asia at 30% per year, Oceania at 20% per year and South Asia at 16% per year.
The Particleboard consumption growth rate at 15% per year was also well above average, with South East Asian countries recording a growth rate of 25% per year, followed by South Asia at 20% per year, North Asia at 15% per year and virtually zero growth in Oceania.
The Plywood and Veneer growth rate for the region was only 8% per year between 1990 and 1995, but this figure masks the extreme variations of a 20% growth rate in China, a zero growth rate in Japan, and a negative recorded growth in Taiwan Province of China and South Asia.
The growth rate for other fibreboards (hardboard and softboard) was only 4.4% per year over the region, but these products are only consumed in fewer than half the countries of the region and, apart from China and Japan, the volumes consumed are very small.
Other products such as Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) are relatively new to the region and consumption is confined mainly to Japan and other North Asian countries.
2.2. Future Consumption Projections
The most probable growth scenario for the Asia Pacific from 1995 to 2010 is probably conservative, showing total wood based panel consumption increasing from 44.4 million m³^ to 96.4 million m³ per year by 2010, which represents an average regional growth rate of 5.3% per year, down by half from the 10% growth rate achieved between 1990 and 1995. The variations within this scenario range from China, with an initial growth rate of 7.5% per year to 2000, falling to 6% per year to 2010; South East Asia and South Asia with an initial growth rate of 7% per year to 2000, falling to 6% per year to 2010, Oceania with a steady growth rate of 4% per year and Japan with a stable growth rate of 3.5% per year to 2010.
The optimistic growth scenario assumes that the region overcomes its current crop of political and financial problems and instabilities, and projects that wood based panel consumption could increase to 117.5 million m³ by 2010, which represents an average growth rate of 7.7% per year throughout the region, down slightly from the 10% growth achieved between 1990 and 1995. This forecast is closer to the expected levels of economic growth in the major countries of the region, and is a distinct possibility, but there are strong negative influences to be overcome first, if this scenario is to be realised.
The pessimistic scenario is unashamedly gloomy and projects a wood based panel consumption level of only 78.8 million m³ in 2010, representing an average regional growth rate of only 4% per year, which is a major drop from the 10% growth rate achieved between 1990 and 1995. The scenario is not impossible however, if the financial sector failures occurring or looming in Japan, Republic of Korea and Thailand are not stopped and the economies turned around. China too has problems to face with the overhaul of its ponderous, loss-making state sector enterprises, which could cause grave economic and political problems.
The most probable scenario for the period from 1995 to 2010 has been analysed in more detail between the types of panels. MDF growth rates are projected to continue at 12.5% till 2000 and to decline to 7.5% per year by 2010. Particleboard growth rates are also projected to decline and to level out at around 6.8% per year by the end of the period. Plywood growth rates are expected to decline to 3.2% per year by 2010. Other fibreboard consumption is expected to decline to a growth rate of 2.6% per year by 2010.
The economic growth and political stability of North Asian countries are the real key to the scenario which will be finally taking place, as the six countries of the sub region account for around 80% of the total wood based panel consumption of the region and 90% of the imports (mainly from South East Asia).

3. CURRENT SITUATION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION 1990-1995
3.1. Market Overview
3.2. Plywood and Veneer
3.3. Particleboard
3.4. Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
3.5. Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
3.6. Hard and Soft Fibreboard
3.7. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL)
3.8. Other Panel Products
3.1. Market Overview
The wood based panel market in the Asia Pacific region has grown dramatically over the last ten years and, between 1990 and 1995, both production and consumption of wood based panels grew at over 10% per annum, when the comparative growth rates in the rest of the world were either between 2.0% and 2.5% or, in the case of Africa and the countries of the former USSR, growth rates were negative.
However the Asia Pacific region contains nearly two thirds of the world's population and there were many different economic performances and growth rates within the region over the period 1990 to 1995. Japan's economy was very quiet throughout the period and wood based panel consumption grew at only 2.0% per year. China's economy, on the other hand was booming and the consumption of wood based panels grew by 20% per year throughout the period.
Wood based panel consumption in the South East Asian countries grew at over 20% per year during the period, and this was matched by a period of frantic activity in the creation of new productive capacity, which is continuing into the next five year period. South Asian countries also registered a healthy growth level of 9.0% per year in panel consumption, New Zealand consumption grew by 10% per year and Australia by 5.5% per year over the period.
There were major differences between the demand for different wood based panels however, with a marked slowdown in the demand for plywood and veneer, which grew at only 3% per year outside China, where demand growth appears to have been 20% per year.
Particleboard demand averaged 15% per year throughout the region, with demand in China reaching 22% per year; demand in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India increasing by between 20% and 30% per year; demand in Republic of Korea increasing by 12.5% per year and demand in Japan increasing at only 7% per year.
Medium density fibreboard (MDF) was the star growth performer however with an average growth rate of 30% per year throughout the region between 1990 and 1995. The consumption of MDF in China grew by an overall 700% in the period; consumption in South East Asia grew by 40% per year; in North Asia consumption grew by 30% per year; in Oceania it grew by 20% per year and in South Asia it grew by 16% per year.
Demand for other forms of fibreboard grew by around 5% per year in China (which accounted for roughly 50% of the total demand), and by about 4% in the rest of the Asia Pacific region.
Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) were new products introduced to the Asia Pacific region during the 1990 to 1995 period, and they have made comparatively small inroads into the structural board market to date.
3.2. Plywood and Veneer
The Plywood and Veneer market remains the dominant feature of the Asia Pacific wood based panel scene, in both volume and value terms. Plywood and Veneer Imports by the six major importers listed in Table A.3., accounted for 11.1 million m³ in 1995, or 78% of the total panel imports of 14.2 million m³. Plywood and Veneer exports by Indonesia and Malaysia alone, out of the six major exporters, accounted for 12.5 million m³ in 1995, or 82% of the total panel exports of 15.2 million m³.
Tables 1 to 25 of the main tables annexed to this report give a detailed picture of the production, imports and exports of all wood based panels, for all the major countries of the Asia Pacific region over the period 1990 to 1995.
In China (Table 1), the enormous apparent increase in the plywood production figures from 1994 to 1995, from 2.6 to 7.6 million m³, was due to the inclusion (by the Chinese Academy of Forestry), from 1995, of all production data from plywood mills outside the state sector. Previous production data was obviously heavily understated, but no exact figures are currently available. The 1995 figures show a plywood and veneer consumption level of 9.94 million m³, of which 24% was imported.
The Japanese plywood & veneer figures (in Table 2), portray a picture of steadily declining plywood production over the period 1990 to 1995, with increasing plywood imports and a relatively static or gently declining total consumption level. This was due partly to the very low levels of economic growth during the period, and partly to the substitution of certain plywood applications by other wood based panels (particularly thin MDF and a small but growing interest in OSB).
Other major plywood markets in the region (such as Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China), show a similar pattern to that of Japan, with declining local production being replaced by increasing imports, with either little growth or an actual decline in plywood & veneer consumption over the period.
Indonesia (Table 7) remains the dominant producer of plywood in the region, but with an almost stagnant regional demand level, the Indonesian production levels have been stuck at around 10 million m³ per year since 1991, and export levels have stayed at around 8.6 to 8.9 million m³ per year over the same period.
Malaysia (Table 8) has increased its plywood & veneer production from 1.8 million m³ in 1990 to 4.5 million m³ in 1995, a remarkable expansion rate of over 20% per year. Exports have similarly expanded from 1.4 million m³ in 1990 to 3.7 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of almost 25% per year. Due partly to a stagnant or declining market in North Asia, and partly to the declining availability of peeler logs, this expansion is unlikely to continue.
Australian production of plywood & veneer increased a little from 125,000 m³ to 145,000 m³ over the period, with 31,000 m³ to 37,000 m³ imports and virtually no exports. New Zealand plywood & veneer production rose from 150,000 m³ in 1990 to 380,000 m³^ in 1995, with plywood exports increasing from 20,000 m³ to 68,000 m³.
Indian production of plywood remained steady at about 360,000 m³ during the period, with exports rising from 9,000 m³ to 38,000 m³ by 1995, leaving about 90% of the plywood for domestic consumption. Pakistan had a small production of about 15,000 m³ per year, all for domestic use.
A noticeable trend in the region's Northern markets is in the increasing use of imported softwood plywood (from New Zealand, North America and Europe), and a steadily increasing interest in OSB as a possible substitute for some plywood applications, particularly in Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore.
3.3. Particleboard
Particleboard consumption in the Asia Pacific region expanded from 4.9 million m³ in 1990 to 9.9 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 15% per year. The production of particleboard in the region grew from a level of 4.2 million m³ in 1990 to 9.6 million m³ in 1995, a very healthy growth rate of 18% per year, but not quite enough to catch up with the growth of demand. The apparent regional deficit shrank from 700,000 m³ in 1990 to 300,000 m³ in 1995, and with a probable installed capacity of 11.75 million m³ by 1998, the deficit could disappear shortly.
China (Table 1) is the largest particleboard producer and consumer in the Asia Pacific region, with production levels which have increased from a probable 1.5 million m³ in 1990 to 4.4 million m³ in 1995. A high proportion of this production capacity (possibly as much as 50%) comes from several hundred very small locally made plants with capacity ratings of 3,000 to 5,000 m³ per year, producing boards of very variable quality from local wood waste or agricultural residues. The import levels of particleboard are very small as a percentage of consumption (about 1.25%).
Japan (Table 2) has expanded its particleboard production from 1.0 million m³ in 1990 to 1.25 million m³ in 1995, and the particleboard consumption has increased from 1.17 million m³ in 1990 to 1.65 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 7% per year which is three times the growth rate of Japan's consumption of wood based panels in general.
Republic of Korea's domestic production of particleboard expanded at more than 25% per year between 1990 and 1995, from 165,000 m³ to 548,000 m³ per year. Imports also increased and total consumption of particleboard rose from 557,000 m³ in 1990 to 1.0 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of 12.5% per year.
Taiwan Province of China's particleboard consumption was small by comparison and rose to 300,000 m³ by 1995. China's Hong Kong SAR and Singapore were small importers and exporters of particleboard, with even smaller domestic consumption.
Indonesia increased its particleboard production from 310,000 m³ to 850,000 m³ over the same period, and exports rose from 103,000 m³ to 300,000 m³. Domestic consumption therefore increased from 207,000 m³ in 1990 to 550,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 22% per year. Though Malaysia's particleboard production increased from 90,000 m³ in 1990 to 400,000 m³ in 1995, exports also rose from 41,000 m³ to 250,000 m³ over the period, with a net increase in domestic consumption from 49,000 m³ to 150,000 m³.
Thailand's production of particleboard rose from 60,000 m³ to 550,000 m³, and exports went from zero to 222,000 m³ over the period. This resulted in net domestic consumption increasing from 60,000 m³ to 328,000 m³. The Philippines consumption level of particleboard also rose from 6,000 m³ in 1990 to 70,000 m³ in 1995.
Australia's particleboard production increased from 723,000 m³ to 864,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995, most of which (92 to 96%) was for domestic consumption. New Zealand production, by comparison, stayed around 170,000 m³ for the whole period, with exports increasing from 35% to 72% of total production.
India's particleboard production and consumption increased fourfold from 100,000 m³ in 1990 to 400,000 m³ in 1995. Pakistan production and consumption stagnated at around 54,000 m³ to 57,000 m³ per year.
3.4. Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
Total consumption of MDF in the Asia Pacific region rose from 1.1 million m³ to 3.7 million m³ between 1990 and 1998, a heady growth rate of 28% per year. The production levels in the region rose almost as fast, from 1.1 million m³ in 1990 to 3.4 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 26% per year.
Production of MDF in China apparently rose from 87,000 m³ in 1990 to 589,000 m³ in 1995, though the 1990 figure has not been adjusted for possible non-state sector production. The relatively small levels of imports and exports indicate that China appears to have a small residual demand deficit in MDF, but this appears to be growing larger each year, as the economy expands.
Japan's production of MDF increased from 256,000 m³ to 400,000 m³ over the period, but imports increased even faster, from 87,000 m³ to 500,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995. The apparent consumption levels therefore rose from 343,000 m³ to 900,000 m³ over the period, a net growth rate of about 21% per year. Though exact data is not available, a large part of this remarkable increase was due to product substitution, by thin MDF replacing thin plywood in many furniture and joinery applications.
Production of MDF in Republic of Korea also increased rapidly, from 158,000 m³ in 1990 to 590,000 m³ in 1995. Imports increased up to 1994 but then dropped back to 1990 levels, leaving a net increase in consumption levels from 254,000 m³ in 1990 to 655,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 20% per year.
Taiwan Province of China has no MDF production capacity, but imports rose from zero to 376,000 m³ by 1995. China's Hong Kong SAR and Singapore were once again playing the roles of both importer and exporter, with small levels of domestic consumption.
Indonesia started the period with zero MDF capacity, but by 1995 had a production level of 100,000 m³ and a much bigger capacity in the pipeline. Malaysia's production of MDF rose from 50,000 m³ in 1990 to 350,000 m³ in 1995, and with some 250,000 m³ exported, domestic consumption has risen from 50,000 m³ to 100,000 m³.
Thailand also had zero capacity in 1990, but increasing to 300,000 m³ by 1995, with 117,000 m³ exported, and 183,000 m³ consumed domestically. Neither Philippines or Singapore have any production capacity but both countries import small quantities.
Australia increased its MDF production fourfold over the period, from 108,000 m³ in 1990 to 436,000 m³ in 1995. Australia is also an active importer and exporter of MDF, and its domestic consumption increased from 154,000 m³ in 1990 to 510,000 m³ by 1995, representing a growth rate of nearly 28% per year over the period.
New Zealand was one of the earliest producers of MDF in the Asia Pacific region, and increased production from 374,000 m³ to 583,000 m³ between 1990 and 1995. The majority of its production of MDF is still exported, but domestic consumption increased from 109,000 m³ in 1990 to 260,000 m³ in 1995, which is a growth rate of almost 20% per year. India and Pakistan both produce small quantities of MDF for their own consumption.
3.5. Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
Though this product is a major member of the wood based panel family in North America, and has a growing presence in Europe, it is currently very little used in the Asia Pacific region. There is a small pilot plant in China but it is being used for standard particleboard at present, and though there are other plants reported to be in the pipeline in China, Indonesia and Thailand, none of them appear to be confirmed projects.
In North America, OSB is a serious competitor for many traditional plywood applications, and has captured a large proportion of the structural panel market, particularly in housing applications. Because it does not need large diameter roundwood as a raw material, and its production costs are very much lower than plywood, the product should have a strong market potential in North Asia, particularly in Japan and China, which are major per capita consumers of plywood. In 1995 Japan imported about 260,000 m³ of OSB and has also imported a large number of prefabricated housing elements containing OSB panels. Small quantities have also been imported by China, Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore, mostly on a trial basis.
3.6. Hard and Soft Fibreboard
Though hardboard and soft insulation board are produced in very few countries in the Asia Pacific region, and many of their traditional uses are being taken by thin MDF and other panels, the products continue to survive in certain traditional markets such as China, Japan and India. Total consumption in the Asia Pacific increased from 2.2 million m³ in 1990 to 2.7 million m³ in 1995, a growth rate of about 4% per year.
China has both the largest production capacity and the largest demand for these products in the region, and its consumption increased from 1,041,000 m³ in 1990 to 1,307,000 m³ in 1995, a growth rate of nearly 5% per year, and a total representing almost 50% of the regional consumption levels.
Japan is the second largest market and the second largest producer, particularly of the soft insulation board variety. The production levels of hardboard dropped slightly over the period, but production of softboard increased, and the combined Japanese consumption of these products increased from 633,000 m³ in 1990 to 741,000 m³ in 1995, which is a growth rate of 3% per year, roughly in line with the economic growth rate.
Republic of Korea produced 160,000 m³ in 1992, but production (and consumption) have dropped back to 24,000 m³ in 1995. Taiwan Province of China and China, Hong Kong SAR import small quantities, though the volumes appear to be declining. Indonesia produces and consumes small quantities, and Malaysia imports a little. Both Thailand and the Philippines produce and consume small quantities, and Thailand is also a net exporter of hardboard.
Australia and New Zealand produce and consume nearly 200,000 m³ of hardboard and softboard between them, but the volumes are not increasing and are not seriously imported or exported. India and Pakistan produce and consume small quantities.
3.7. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL)
LVL is a sub-classification of plywood, in which peeled veneers are laid up with the grain always parallel to the length, bonded with phenolic resin, into discreet panel sizes or into long structural beams up to 25 or 30 metres in length.
The total production of LVL in the Asia Pacific region in 1995 was 588,000 m³, with over 70% of the capacity being in Indonesia, mainly destined for export. Japan was the major consumer of LVL in the region in 1995, with a total consumption of 238,000 m³.
3.8. Other Panel Products
Cement Bonded Particleboard (CBPB) is a panel manufactured from cement and wood chips or flakes, and the pressing or setting process produces a useful building material for housing applications which is strong, easily worked and is both fire and moisture resistant.
Japan is the main producer and consumer of CBPB in the Asia Pacific region, with a capacity around 500,000 m³ per year. China, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines all have a small production capacity of CBPB, some of which is exported to Japan.
Gypsum Fibreboard (GFB) is a panel made from gypsum and reconstituted fibre or paper waste. The product is a low cost, fireproof building panel. There are currently three small GFB mills in China and one in Thailand.
Triboard is a composite structural panel produced at a mill in New Zealand, predominately for the Japanese market. It consists of a thick, high density fibreboard core with two facing veneers.

4. THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF CONSUMPTION AND TRADE
4.1. The effect of economic growth
4.2. The importance of external trade
4.3. The growth in construction activity
4.4. Development of the furniture industry
4.5. Substitution within wood based panel categories
4.1. The effect of economic growth
The primary driving force on the wood based panel market in the Asia Pacific region has been the extraordinary and sustained economic growth rates achieved in most countries of the region over the last ten to fifteen years.
The very close relationship between the growth rate of real GDP and the growth rate of wood based panel consumption in every region of the world, is clearly illustrated in Table A.1 below.

The average growth rate of real GDP in the Asia Pacific region between 1988 and 1995 was 8.0% per year, compared to a World average of 3.0% per year and an Industrialised country average of around 2% per year. Excluding Japan, the Asian GDP growth rate of 15.8% was in stark contrast to the rest of the world, which had growth rates somewhere between 2.2% and 2.5% per year.
The relationship between GDP growth and the growth rate in wood based panel consumption is also very clear, and the contrast between Asia (excluding Japan) and the rest of the world is equally stark. The Rest of Asia wood based panel consumption rate grew by 16.4% per year compared to only 2.0% per year for Japan, 1.6% per year for North and South America, 3.5% per year for Europe and a 1% per year decline in Africa.
A more detailed analysis of the growth in wood based panel consumption in the Asia Pacific region is given in Table A.2 below. It illustrates clearly the dominant role played by the rapidly expanding economies of China and the South East Asian countries, where the consumption growth rates were 20% and 21%, per year respectively.

Table A.2 also shows that wood based panel consumption growth rates in South Asia (the Indian subcontinent), in the rest of North Asia, and in Oceania, at 9.0%, 7.5% and 6.8% per year respectively, were also well above the average growth rates for the rest of the world.
In Asia, Japan was the notable exception to the general growth pattern, with a typical 'industrialised country' consumption growth level of just 2.0% per year. Excluding Japan, the wood based panel consumption in the rest of Asia grew at an average of 16% per year from 1990 to 1995, roughly doubling total consumption levels from 13.2 million m³ to 28.3 million m³.
4.2. The importance of external trade
In general, the major countries engaged in wood based panel trade are either timber deficient (and thus in need of imports), or rich in timber resources (and thus wishing to capitalise on the situation by developing exports). In Tables 57 and, the production, consumption and trade in wood based panels in the six major importing countries and the six major exporting countries in the Asia Pacific region, has been analysed in detail.
The selection of six major importing countries and six major exporting countries from over thirty countries within the region was not an arbitrary decision. The countries selected are the major economies of the region, and are thus the major players in the production, consumption and trade in wood based panels. Table A.3 below is a shortened summary of the detailed data from Tables 57 and 58, and clearly show that the twelve countries selected accounted for 97.3% of the wood based panel consumption in the Asia Pacific region in 1995, and virtually 100% of the import and export trade.

TOTALS
Within the above groupings of six Importers and six Exporters, there are countries such as China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Philippines and Australia who could be in either group, as they play roles as both exporters and importers, so the selection is somewhat arbitrary. There are also major variations in relative performance, such as Indonesia and Malaysia who dominate the export league with over 90% of total exports within the region, or Japan, China and Republic of Korea who account for 77% of all imports within the region.
The average level of import dependency in the six importing countries was 39% in 1995, and this ratio will probably increase over the next ten to fifteen years as they are all heavily timber deficient. The average level of export dependency in the six exporting countries was 71% in 1995, and this ratio will probably decrease in future, as the economic growth in the countries concerned will stimulate higher domestic demand for their own wood based panels.
4.3. The growth in construction activity
The enormous level of activity in building up the infrastructure of the countries of Asia is evident throughout the region, with countless projects for new roads, new rapid transit systems and monorails, new airports and harbours and many others. Most of these projects use concrete and steel, with only limited use for wood based panels apart from concrete formwork or shuttering panels.
But there is also a massive parallel drive to build new housing, new shops and commercial properties, new condominiums, new office blocks, new hotels and restaurants, new schools, clinics and hospitals, new stadiums and other sporting and recreational facilities.
Many of these buildings require large amounts of structural and decorative wood based panels, particularly in the joinery work for cupboards and fixtures and fittings, and above all for the movable furniture items.
Residential housing remains the main construction activity requiring significant amounts of wood based panels, either in concrete formwork or, in North Asian countries, in flooring, panelling or sheathing. Data on residential housing is unreliable, but Asia is probably building around 4 million housing units per year, of which more than half are in China and Japan. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are building many new low cost housing projects, with a combined output of over 500,000 housing units per year, and their needs are increasing all the time, as their populations expand.
4.4. Development of the furniture industry
The furniture industry in Asia is the major consumer of wood based panels in the region, and furniture output (in value terms) has been expanding throughout the region at about 10% to 15% per year for the last ten years. Though furniture exports from the region now exceed a value of US$ 3 billion per year, the main driving force has been increased domestic demand, particularly in China, Japan and Republic of Korea.
China's furniture industry is characterised by thousands of local, small scale workshops with very little automation of assembly operations. Standards are very variable and construction techniques often depend on the availability of different types of wood or wood based panels.
Hollow core, lightweight furniture is very common in Japan, but with increasing labour, material and overhead costs, the furniture industry is stagnating and will rely increasingly on imported furniture in future, possibly from satellite branches of Japanese firms, set up in China, Malaysia, Thailand or Vietnam.
Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, China, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore have had well established furniture sectors geared essentially to exports, for the last ten to fifteen years, but their labour intensive industries such as furniture are now in decline, and are being replaced by more capital intensive high-tech industries.
The furniture industries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are now in a period of rapid growth, and they will increasingly dominate the furniture export scene in Asia. Much of their high quality furniture is currently made from solid rubberwood, but the use of MDF and particleboard panels is increasing rapidly, particularly in 'case goods' intended for export to Japan, Europe or North America.
4.5. Substitution within wood based panel categories
The driving forces behind the substitution trends that are changing the face of the traditional forest industries in Asia are the increasing shortage of good quality large diameter logs for plywood and sawnwood production, the resulting increase in prices of plywood and sawnwood, and the massively increasing availability of low cost, high quality reconstituted wood based panels such as particleboard and MDF. Typical examples are:-
· substitution by thin MDF of thin plywood and hardboard in cabinet backs and drawer bottoms.
· substitution by thicker MDF and particleboard of solid wood and thicker plywood in table tops and cabinet construction.
· substitution by thin MDF of thin plywood and hardboard in doorskins and panelling applications in house building and internal decoration.
· substitution by thick MDF of solid wood in moulding production.
· substitution by particleboard and OSB of solid wood and thicker plywood in flooring applications.
· substitution by composite panels and OSB of solid wood and thick plywood in concrete formwork.
· substitution by LVL and MDF of solid wood in doors and doorframes.
· Substitution by OSB of solid wood and plywood in packaging and pallets.
It is evident from the above list of examples that particleboard and MDF are going to be the key panel products in the Asia Pacific region in future; that many solidwood, plywood and hardboard applications can be economically substituted by particleboard and MDF, and that OSB and LVL also have a growing potential in several niche applications for which they are particularly well suited.

5.2. The availability of small diameter plantation industrial roundwood
5.3. The availability and use of mill residues
5.4. The availability and use of Rubberwood
5.5. The possible use of Oil Palm fibre residues
5.6. The use of Agricultural residues
5.1. The availability of large diameter roundwood
Hardwood log production from South East Asia has been the mainstay of the Asian plywood industry for the last twenty five years, but has been in steady decline for almost the last ten years. Hardwood log production reached a peak of 110 million m³ in 1989, but is currently down to about 98 million m³ per year and is expected to drop below 80 million m³ per year by 2010. This reduction could be even greater as several Governments have endorsed ITTO targets to achieve sustainable forest management levels and practices by the year 2000, and if these practices are strictly enforced, logging levels in Asia could drop below 70 million m³ per year by 2010.
Another factor affecting Hardwood log supply is that extraction costs from natural forests are rising as the loggers are having to haul logs much greater distances from the forest areas to the mills or the ports. Log diameters are also dwindling (as undisturbed forest areas are becoming much rarer), making high recovery yields more difficult. The net result of all these factors is a steady increase in the cost of good quality peeler logs, reducing the ability of plywood to compete with alternative panel products.
Small quantities of Softwood logs are being used for plywood peeling as substitutes for hardwood logs in some countries, with softwood log supplies being sourced from natural softwood forests in Russia, and Radiata Pine plantations in New Zealand and Chile. China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan Province of China already process about 5 million m³ of domestic and imported softwood logs, through their plywood industries, and this volume could increase to perhaps 12 million m³ per year by 2010.
5.2. The availability of small diameter plantation industrial roundwood
The growing use of plantation grown Radiata Pine logs from New Zealand and Chile to substitute for Hardwood peeler logs in North Asian plywood mills has been discussed in the previous section, but should be recognised as an important contribution to the overall Asia Pacific wood based panel raw material supply situation in future.
China currently has some 2.5 million ha of industrial plantations which supply valuable roundwood supplies to China's sawmilling and wood based panel industries, and under current Government plans aiming for self sufficiency in timber resources by the year 2040, the industrial plantation area should increase steadily to around 20 million ha by that time.
Radiata Pine harvesting from existing New Zealand plantations should increase to about 26 million m³ per year in 2010, and similar plantations in Chile could be producing around 14 million m³ per year by the same date.
Though much of it was planted for the pulp and paper industry, Acacia, Gmelina and Eucalyptus plantations in Indonesia and the Philippines currently cover about 700,000 ha and, if maintained and enhanced could be contributing reasonable quantities of timber raw material by the year 2010. Indonesia also some 800,000 ha of Teak plantations in Eastern Java, some of which are over 80 years old and already yielding high value raw material for decorative veneers and other applications.
Other areas of industrial roundwood plantations include 190,000 ha in Thailand consisting of Eucalyptus, Casuarina, Acacia and some Teak; 108,000 ha in Malaysia consisting mainly of Acacia, Gmelina and Eucalyptus; and 600,000 ha of mixed industrial plantations in Vietnam.
5.3. The availability and use of mill residues
The majority of reconstituted wood based panels utilise a certain amount of mill residues, but these account for only a small proportion of the total potential available in the Asia Pacific region.

Assuming an average product recovery of 60% from all sawmills and plywood mills in the region (which is almost certainly not achieved in most countries), the total availability of wood residues from sawmilling and plymilling in 1995, around the region, would be as shown in Table A.4.
Even at a generous ratio of 1.5 m³ of wood residues to produce 1 m³ of reconstituted wood based panel, the availability shown in Table A.4 is sufficient to produce around 60 million m³ of particleboard, MDF or other fibreboard.
Yet the record shows that, in 1995, only some 15.5 million m³ of reconstituted wood based panels were produced in the Asia Pacific region, and quite a high proportion of that total was produced from small diameter roundwood, either from rubberwood clearances or thinnings from industrial timber plantations. A smaller but not insignificant proportion of the panels were also made from agricultural residues such as bagasse, wheat straw or cotton stalks.
Table A.5 below attempts to show the proportion of the Asia Pacific production of reconstituted wood based panels manufactured from mill residues in 1995.

The estimated figures in Table A.5 showing actual use of wood residues, are based on the author's experience and local knowledge of the region, and are probably generous, but even they indicate that there are unused wood residues in the mills of the Asia Pacific capable of producing around another 50 million m³ per year of particleboard, MDF or other fibreboards.
5.4. The availability and use of Rubberwood
Rubber plantations in South East Asia now total some 6.6 million hectares and, though declining in area in Malaysia, are increasing in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.
Under perfect conditions, with constant 28-30 year rotation, and an estimated per hectare yield of 70 m³ of small diameter sawlogs and 170 m³ of even smaller diameter roundwood residues, the rubber estates of the region could theoretically yield an annual total of some 15.4 million m³ of sawlogs and 37 million m³ of roundwood residues. The sawlogs, in turn, could yield about 5.4 million m³ of sawnwood plus 10 million m³ of sawmill residues, bringing the total available residue material suitable for reconstituted wood based panels to some 47 million m³ per year.
Reality, as usual, is a very different picture. A very high proportion of the planted areas of rubberwood are in the hands of smallholders, many of whom have only a few hectares of (usually) very over-mature trees (particularly in Malaysia and Thailand). The level of sawlog production achieved from smallholdings varies from a high of 45% of potential in Thailand to only 10% in Malaysia. Many large rubberwood estates in Malaysia have either been broken up into smallholdings or largely converted to oil palm plantations, which have yielded higher returns in recent years.
The estimated potential output of the rubberwood plantations in South East Asia over the coming twenty five years is given in Table A.6 below:

The figures in the above table are for possible potential yields of sawnwood (top half), and either particleboard, MDF or any other reconstituted wood based panel (bottom half).
Though it will continue to be an important ancillary raw material source for the reconstituted wood based panel industries of South East Asia, rubberwood supply is made extremely difficult by the severe fragmentation of estates into smallholdings and, as can be seen, rubberwood as a raw material is unlikely even to achieve 10% of its theoretical potential for the wood based panel industry.
5.5. The possible use of Oil Palm fibre residues
The use of Oil Palm fibre for reconstituted wood based panels has been the subject of many tests and trials over recent years, but with the apparent decline in the long term potential of rubberwood, these tests have assumed added urgency. Some very recent work has shown that acceptable board properties and economic advantages can be achieved with the fibre material in the rejected part of the bunch, after the oil has been squeezed out at the palm oil mill. The oil palm fronds which fall regularly from the palms are also showing promising results, but the probable cost of collection is thought to rule out any economic advantage.
There are currently some 4 million ha of Oil Palm estate in South East Asia and the research work is being watched with great interest by both potential producers and manufacturers of machinery. At a conservative estimate of 1 ton per day of used bunch fibre and fallen fronds per hectare, the total possible fibre availability in the Oil Palm estates of South East Asia is a staggering 1 billion tons per year. If the trials are successful and lead to full commercial production of wood based panels, the industry will quickly adapt to the new situation, as oil palm fibre from used bunches has the advantage over rubberwood that it is collected in small quantities every working day, on every oil palm estate, and is thus a much more regular raw material source.
5.6. The use of Agricultural residues
The history of the use of agricultural residues in particleboard and fibreboard is a long and well documented story, which includes successful trials and pilot plants using such materials as bagasse (de-pithed sugar cane), cotton stalks, wheat straw, rice husks and many other materials, in several Asian countries.
Partly because of quality control problems, but mainly because of the seasonal nature of agriculture, the really large scale successful panel plants using agricultural residues are few and far between. When cotton or sugar cane for example have only one cropping season per year, sufficient raw material has to be collected, treated, baled and stored in one short period to enable the panel plant to operate throughout the year.
There is no shortage of the various potential raw materials, but the economics of the plants will depend firstly on the cost of collecting the raw materials from, possibly, many small and scattered locations, with only rudimentary transport infrastructure. The second problem, referred to above, is the cost and practicality of storing and preserving a years supply of raw material in one (or perhaps two) short harvesting seasons.
The principle appears to work reasonably well with very small plants in rural locations (in say China or India), and where export standard product quality is not required. But recent efforts to utilise bagasse in larger scale MDF plants in the Guangdong province of China did not work well, and the plants reverted to wood waste raw material.
With the expansion of particleboard and MDF production in the Asia Pacific region to some 40 million m³ per year, over the next 15 to 20 years, more work will be needed in efforts to harness this abundant raw material to the needs of the modern, large scale wood based panel mills of the future.

6. FUTURE CONSUMPTION AND TRADE SCENARIOS TO 2010
6.1. General Overview
6.2. North Asia
6.3. South East Asia
6.4. Oceania
6.5. South Asia
6.1. General Overview
In Tables 26 to 50 attached to this report, we have presented our most probable scenario projections for the future consumption of wood based panels in the 25 principal countries of the Asia Pacific region, between 1995 and 2010. Table 51 presents a summary of total wood based panel consumption, actual and projected, between 1990 and 2010, and Tables 52 to 56 present the same periodic summary for the individual types of wood based panel, under the headings, 'Plywood & Veneer', 'Particleboard', 'MDF', 'Hard & Soft Fibreboard' and 'OSB & LVL'.
The total panel summary in Table 51 is based primarily on the relationship between the growth rates of GDP and wood based panel consumption, though the future projections are affected by current economic thinking in the region, which includes recent changes in economic outlook in China, Republic of Korea, Japan and Thailand.
The fact that total wood based panel consumption in the region has grown by over 10% per year over the last five years has, to some extent, been attributed to the effect of sudden changes in the deteriorating supply situation of hardwood sawlogs and veneer logs from South East Asia, which have stimulated a burst of activity in the production capacity of MDF in the region, affecting the substitution effects between thin MDF and thin plywood, primarily on economic grounds.
To simplify the study findings, only the most probable scenario of future economic growth rates and wood based panel consumption growth rates has been adopted in these tables, where several significant panel consuming countries in the region (the 'Asian Tigers') are achieving the coveted 'developed country' levels of per capita GDP, and are thus expecting slower economic growth rates in the future. Future regional economic and wood based panel consumption growth rates are forecast to level off at 5.5% per year from 1995 to 2000 and at 5.0% per year from 2000 to 2010.
The pessimistic and optimistic future growth scenarios are shown, region by region, in Tables A.7 to A.10 in this section, with corresponding decreases and increases in the forecast economic and panel consumption growth rates. In general, the pessimistic scenarios show a marked slowdown in the economies of the region, attributed to the imminent political changes in China, Republic of Korea and Thailand, and a continuation of the 'slow growth' scenario in Japan. The optimistic scenarios show a steady continuation of the trends observed during the 1990 to 1995 period.
6.2. North Asia
6.2.1. China
6.2.2. Japan
6.2.3. Republic of Korea
6.2.4. Taiwan Province of China
6.2.5. China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau
Table A.7 below shows the optimistic, most probable and pessimistic scenarios for wood based panel consumption in the countries of North Asia from 1995 to 2010.
6.2.1. China
The most probable scenario of growth is very similar to the one prepared by the Chinese Academy of Forestry in Section 2 of the Outlook Study, with growth rates slowing down from the hectic 20% per year level of the early 90's to 7.5% per year from 1995 to 2000, and a steady 6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (compared to the Academy's rather pessimistic forecast of a 5% growth rate). The optimistic scenario shown here is also a possibility, with a 10% growth rate to the year 2000, followed by a decade of 7% per year growth, which is similar to the average growth patterns in South East Asia over the last ten years. The argument for the pessimistic scenario, of a 6% per year growth rate, slowing down to 4% per year from 2000 to 2010, would be to reflect the effect of the growing problems of the loss-making and inefficient state sector enterprises, and the painful solutions that will have to be found to turn them around.
6.2.2. Japan
The most probable 3.5% per year growth rate scenario for Japan is a reflection of current economic growth rates of a more confident Japan that has weathered a long recession through the early 90's, with a series of property-related financial and banking disasters, hopefully now behind it. The country's continuing ability to post massive trade surpluses and expand its exports provides a solid basis for confidence in the future. The optimistic scenario with a 4.5% per year growth rate is not a serious possibility, as the per capita consumption of wood based panels of 130 m³/1000 capita is already above average for OECD countries. The pessimistic scenario of a 2.5% growth rate is similar to the performance of the last five years, which could continue if the banking and financial sector continue to stagnate or collapse, causing serious economic growth problems.

6.2.3. Republic of Korea
The economic growth rate of Republic of Korea has already slowed down from the 9% levels of the early 90's, and current political instability and financial problems are expected to bring growth rates back to a sustainable 5% per year for the foreseeable future. With a speedy (but unlikely) solution to the current political impasse, and a wood based panel consumption level of 83 m³ per 1,000 capita, the more optimistic scenario of 7% and 6% growth rates is a real possibility, but if the financial problems grow worse, the economy could conceivably slow down even further, with a possible 4% growth rate as a result.
6.2.4. Taiwan Province of China
The wood based panel consumption growth rate slowed down a little in the early 90's, but with a per capita consumption level of 88 m³ per 1,000, there is still room for growth, and with a current GDP growth rate of 6.5% per year, the most probable scenario for the future is considered to be a steady 5% per year growth rate in wood based panel consumption.
The optimistic scenario is based on a consumption growth rate of 7% from 1995 to 2000, declining to 6% from 2000 to 2010, and these growth rates are real possibilities in view of the increasing level of the island's investment in mainland China, including the forest industry sector. The pessimistic scenario assumes a steady consumption growth rate of 4% per year till 2010, though this is only likely if the political situation regarding the status of Taiwan Province of China deteriorates significantly in the near future.
6.2.5. China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau
China, Hong Kong SAR has reverted to Chinese control, and Macau will follow shortly, so a discussion of their prospective growth rates is probably quite meaningless. However it is relevant to note that, with almost the highest per capita incomes in Asia, the combined population of the two have a per capita consumption of wood based panels of only 63 m³^ per 1,000 capita, which is lower than expected, and probably due to a higher proportion of their GDP being attributed to financial services and other 'non-industrial' uses. Their consumption data will have little effect on future consumption data from China.

6.3.7. Vietnam
6.3.8. Myanmar, Laos & Cambodia
6.3.1. Indonesia
The growth in Indonesian wood based panel consumption between 1990 and 1995 shown in Table 51 appears to be almost 900%, but the data is probably affected by plywood stock balance changes, so that the 1990 consumption level is probably understated. The per capita panel consumption level in 1995 was still only 10 m³ per 1,000. An estimated growth rate of 15% per year is probably more realistic, and the most probable future growth scenario in Table A.8 below predicts a consumption growth rate of 7% till 2000, which is closer to estimated GDP growth levels, declining to 6% per year to 2010.
The optimistic scenario shows an initial growth rate of 10% per year, declining to 8% per year to 2010, and this scenario is quite possible, if the country settles down after the recent electoral and political turbulence. If the turbulence increases however, the pessimistic scenario shows a steady growth rate of 5% per year, which would be an excellent performance for many countries but, in South East Asia, would be considered disappointing.

6.3.2. Malaysia
The economic growth rate of Malaysia has slowed down slightly from the hectic pace of the early 90's, but is still around 8% per year. With a wood based panel consumption growth rate of 12% per year from 1990 to 1995, the per capita panel consumption level reached 58 m³ per 1,000, one of the highest in South East Asia. The most probable future scenario in Table A.8 below predicts a consumption growth rate steadying down to 7% per year till 2000 and declining further to 6% per year till 2010. With ample timber resources however, and major infrastructural projects in the pipeline, the optimistic scenario is eminently feasible, depicting a 10% growth in consumption per year till 2000 and a steady 8% per year till 2010. There are some concerns however about the long term financial stability of the Malaysian economy and if these fears are realised, the pessimistic scenario predicts a possible drop to a steady consumption growth rate of only 5% per year.
6.3.3. Thailand
Thailand has also had an excellent economic growth rate over the last seven years, and this is matched by the wood based panel consumption growth rate of 12% per year from 1990 to 1995, when per capita consumption levels reached 16 m³ per 1,000. The economy has slowed down however and the most probable growth scenario in Table A.8 therefore predicts a 7% growth rate till 2000, followed by a steady 6% per year growth rate till 2010. With mounting worldwide concern about the Baht, and the troubled financial sector however, the optimistic growth scenario of a 10% growth to 2000, followed by a growth rate of 8% per year to 2010, does not look to be a serious possibility. More likely is a continued downturn in the economy with a possible pessimistic consumption growth scenario of 5% per year.
6.3.4. Philippines
Despite a period of political stability through the early 90's, the economic growth rate of the Philippines has not matched that of its South East Asian neighbours, and is still just less than 6% per year. However, partly because it was starting off from the very low wood based panel consumption level of only 4 m³ per 1,000 capita, consumption growth rose at 10% per year from 1990 to 1995 and, at 6.5 m³ per 1,000, is still very low by regional standards. The most probable scenario in Table A.8. predicts a growth rate of 6% per year to 2000, followed by 5% per year to 2010. Given continued economic and political stability however, the optimistic scenario growth levels of 8% per year to 2000 and 7% per year to 2010 are reasonable possibilities. With possible problems following a new presidential election however, the pessimistic scenario depicts a lower growth rate of 5% per year to 2000 followed by 4% per year to 2010.
6.3.5. Singapore
Because Singapore is both a major importer and exporter of wood based panels, the apparent consumption levels vary widely due to opening and closing stock levels, and they varied from 78,000 m³ to 464,000 m³ per year during the period 1990 to 1995, averaging 250,000 m³ per year, and a growth rate of 5% per year. This represents a panel consumption level of 80 m³ per 1,000 capita, and the most probable growth scenario predicts a continuation of a steady 5% per year growth in consumption till 2010. The optimistic growth scenario assumes that Singapore can get back to its more normal GDP growth rates of 8 to 9%, with a panel consumption growth rate of 8% to 2000, declining to 7% to 2010. The pessimistic scenario assumes that the current economic stagnation continues, with a panel consumption growth of only 4% throughout the period.
6.3.6. Brunei
The panel consumption level of Brunei in 1995 was 9,000 m³, or the equivalent of 30 m³^ per 1,000 capita, but in volume terms it had varied from 2,000 m³ to 37,000 m³ per year from 1990 to 1995, and with a small, very rich country such as Brunei, averages and trends tend to be relatively meaningless. The three scenario calculations in Table A.8 are therefore rather academic and could be vastly exceeded by one major infrastructural project in the capital.
6.3.7. Vietnam
The past record of Vietnam is little guide to its future performance, and its wood based panel consumption stagnated at 36,000 to 40,000 m³ throughout the 1990 to 1995 period, which represented a per capita consumption level of only 0.5 m³ per 1,000.
The country undoubtedly has the potential for strong economic growth and parallel growth in wood based panel consumption, and with a current GDP growth rate of over 9% per year, the most probable growth scenario predicts a consumption growth of 7%, declining to 6% per year. If the political and bureaucratic obstacles to growth are removed, the optimistic scenario could be a consumption growth of 10% per year, declining to 8% per year, and a pessimistic growth rate of only 5% per year.
6.3.8. Myanmar, Laos & Cambodia
The comments made about Vietnam above apply equally to Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. The wood based panel consumption levels of these countries were low and stagnant throughout 1990 to 1995, and represented per capita consumption levels of only 0.4 m³ per 1,000, 1.4 m³ per 1,000 and 0.3 m³ per 1,000 respectively in 1995, virtually the lowest in the region.
Future predictions are difficult, but for the sake of consistency, we have used the same most probable, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios as for Vietnam. They all have strong economic potential, but there are no current signs of the political will and stability needed to start on the path of serious economic development.

6.4.5. Other Islands
6.4.1. Australia
The growth scenarios for the countries of Oceania are shown in Table A.9. below. Australian per capita consumption levels had reached 87 m³ per 1,000 in 1995, and the panel consumption growth rate had averaged 5.5% from 1990 to 1995. Influenced primarily by the slow recent and current economic growth rates of around 3% per year, the most probable panel consumption growth scenario predicts a steady growth of 4% throughout the 1995 to 2010 period.
The optimistic growth scenario is a growth rate of 5% per year and the pessimistic growth rate is 3% per year. The country is stable and already well developed, so no wild swings in economic or panel consumption growth are anticipated.

6.4.2. New Zealand
New Zealand currently has a per capita wood based panel consumption level of 200 m³ per 1,000, which is one of the highest levels in the world. The country is a major producer and exporter of MDF panels, and has shown itself to be very innovative in the utilisation and marketing of MDF. Nevertheless, its relatively low current GDP growth rate of 2.3% per year and its very high per capita consumption has influenced the most probable growth scenario, which predicts a steady continued consumption growth of 4% per year to 2010. As with Australia, the optimistic growth scenario is a steady 5% per year and the pessimistic growth scenario is a steady 3% per year. It is also a stable, highly developed country and wild swings or growth variations are not anticipated.
6.4.3. Papua New Guinea
The wood based panel consumption level of Papua New Guinea in 1995 was only 10 m³ per 1,000 capita, consisting mainly of domestically manufactured plywood. There had been no growth in consumption from 1990 to 1995, but the country's economy is growing steadily, and the most probable consumption growth scenario predicts a steady growth level of 5% year from 1995 to 2010, with an optimistic growth level of 6% per year and a pessimistic growth level of 3% per year.
6.4.4. Fiji
Fiji experienced a period of political turbulence in the early 90's and its total wood based panel consumption declined from 13,000 m³ in 1990 to 9,000 m³ per year in 1995, representing a drop from 16 m³ to 11 m³ per 1,000 capita. The political scene is now much calmer and the GDP growth rate is 4.4% per year, so the most probable consumption growth scenario predicts a panel consumption growth level of 5% per year, with an optimistic growth level of 5% and a pessimistic growth level of 4% per year.
6.4.5. Other Islands
The other Pacific islands are all minor panel importers, and the same growth scenarios have been used for them as for Fiji.

6.5.1. India
The steady economic liberalisation of India is continuing under the new coalition Government, and the GDP growth rates of 5% to 7% per year achieved since 1990 are continuing. The wood based panel consumption levels grew by 10% per year between 1990 and 1995, nearly reaching a per capita consumption level of 1.0 m³ per 1,000 by 1995. The most probable scenario for future consumption growth in Table A.10 above predicts a growth rate of 7% per year to 2000, declining to 6% per year to 2010. The optimistic scenario is a continuation of the 10% growth rate to 2000, declining to 8% per year to 2010. The pessimistic scenario is a relapse to previous steady growth rates of 5% per year.
6.5.2. Pakistan
The total wood based panel consumption in Pakistan grew only at 1% per year between 1990 and 1995, and the per capita consumption level in 1995 was only 0.7 m³ per 1,000. With GDP growing only at 6% per year, the most probable consumption growth scenario in Table A.10 predicts a 6% growth rate to 2000, declining to 5% per year to 2010. The optimistic growth rate is expected to be 8% per year to 2000, declining to 6% per year, and the pessimistic growth rate is shown as 5% per year, declining to 4% per year by 2010.

6.5.3. Sri Lanka
Despite the country's semi permanent civil war-footing, the economy of Sri Lanka continues to grow steadily, and wood based panel consumption grew by 10% per year between 1990 and 1995, reaching a per capita consumption level of 2.7 m³ per 1,000 by 1995. Table A.10 shows a most probable growth scenario of 6% per year to 2000, declining to 5% per year to 2010. The most optimistic scenario is an 8% per year growth, declining to 6% per year, and the pessimistic scenario is a 5% per year growth, declining to 4% per year to 2010.
6.5.4. Bangladesh
The wood based panel consumption level in Bangladesh was virtually stagnant through the early 90's, reaching a total volume level of only 10,000 m³ in 1995, which represented a per capita consumption level of only 0.08 m³ per 1,000, almost certainly the lowest consumption level in the region. Nevertheless, the current GDP growth rate is 4.7% per year and the most probable growth scenario in Table A.10 shows a 7% per year growth, declining to 6% per year. The optimistic scenario shows a 10% per year growth, declining to 8% per year, and the pessimistic scenario shows a steady 5% growth rate to 2010.
6.5.5. Bhutan
Tiny Bhutan in the Himalayas has the highest per capita wood based panel consumption in South Asia, with a 1995 level of 18.5 m³ per 1,000 capita, and a total volume of 13,000 m³^ per year. Table A.10 shows a most probable growth scenario of a continuation of the current 6% per year consumption growth rate, declining to 5% per year. The optimistic scenario is an 8% per year growth rate, declining to 6% per year, and the pessimistic scenario is a 5% per year growth rate, declining to 4% per year.
6.5.6. Maldives & Nepal
The Maldives & Nepal import small quantities of wood based panels and their consumption is expected to grow at the same general rate as the rest of South Asia.

The plywood industries of the Asia Pacific are not generally in expansion mode at present, as the supply of large peeler logs is steadily diminishing and many existing plywood applications are coming under intense competitive pressure from thin MDF and increasingly from OSB.
Nevertheless, there are a few new mills being implemented and new lines added to existing mills, as is seen in the list below:

7.2. Particleboard
The growth in planned particleboard capacity in the Asia Pacific region is shown clearly by country and by plant from 1994 to 1998, in Tables 62, 63, 64 and 65 attached to this report.
In summary, the total regional capacity is expanding as follows:
Year
Total Capacity
Growth
%/Year
10,468,000 m³
11,034,000 m³
566,000 m³
11,499,000 m³
465,000 m³
12,934,000 m³
1,435,000 m³
13,754,000 m³
820,000 m³
3,286,000 m³
It is interesting to compare the above capacity figures with the regional growth in consumption, from an actual consumption of 9,879,000 m³ in 1995 to a forecast of demand of 15 million m³ for the year 2000. The 1995 figures showed a net deficit of 755,000 m³, or 7.7% of demand. The demand forecast for 2000 shows the need for an additional capacity of over 1.3 million m³ between 1998 and 2000, which requires continued growth at the same levels as 1994 to 1998.
The major capacity increases by country between 1994 and 1998 are as follows:
Country
Capacity Increase
Thailand
1,030,000 m³
Malaysia
850,000 m³
China
360,000 m³
Japan
240,000 m³
Indonesia
240,000 m³
Philippines
207,000 m³
India
140,000 m³
Republic of Korea
135,000 m³
Pakistan
124,000 m³
With regional particleboard demand forecast to increase to 21.2 million m³ by the year 2005 and 29.6 million m³ by the year 2010, the particleboard industry should be planning for an average increase of 1.3 million m³ production capacity per year till the year 2010, which represents 13 plants per year at an average plant capacity of 100,000 m³ per year.
7.3. Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)
The detailed analysis of increasing MDF capacity in the Asia Pacific region is given in tables 59, 60 and 61, also on a country by country and plant by plant basis.
The total production capacity volume growth pattern is best illustrated in the table below:
Year
Total Capacity
Growth
%/Year
2,974,000 m³
4,091,000 m³
1,117,000 m³
5,316,000 m³
1,225,000 m³
6,826,000 m³
1,510,000 m³
7,561,000 m³
735,000 m³
4,587,000 m³
Comparing the above MDF production capacity figures with the consumption and demand volumes given in Table 54, it is apparent that with a 1995 demand level of 3,692,000 m³, the impending over-capacity situation was already apparent, and with 1998 capacity levels some 12.5% over the demand forecast for the year 2000, there were going to be problems ahead in the MDF sector.
The major capacity increase by country between 1994 and 1998 were as follows:
Country
Capacity Increase
China
1,021,000 m³
Indonesia
750,000 m³
Malaysia
653,000 m³
Australia
625,000 m³
Republic of Korea
419,000 m³
Thailand
381,000 m³
New Zealand
295,000 m³
Japan
283,000 m³
India
112,000 m³
With regional demand for MDF forecast to increase to 9.7 million m³ by the year 2005, and to 14 million m³ by 2010, an additional production capacity equivalent to 6 million m³^ per year will be required by 2010, at an average annual increase of 500,000 m³ per year.
7.4. OSB and LVL
The future growth prospects for OSB and LVL are still very debatable. There are reports of two OSB projects in China, one at Ganzhou with a capacity of 17,000 m³, and one at Yong'an with a capacity of 70,000 m³, but neither of these has been confirmed by the Chinese Academy of Forestry. There is also a report of a planned OSB project in Thailand with a capacity of 105,000 m³, but again there is no official confirmation from Government sources.
7.5. Other Fibreboard
Two small fibreboard projects were announced in 1996 but they have not been officially confirmed. One was a 32,000 m³ plant in China and the other was a 24,000 m³ plant in Thailand.

8. FUTURE REGIONAL WBP TRADE BALANCE FORECASTS FOR 2010
8.1. Trade Flows to the six major Importing Countries
8.2. Trade Flows from the six major Exporting Countries
8.1. Trade Flows to the six major Importing Countries
Forecasting future levels of demand for the various types of wood based panels is already a difficult exercise, but in Table 66 we have attempted to forecast the level of import dependency in the six major Importing Countries of the region in 2010.
The Outlook Study predicts that Japan will be 55% dependant on total panel imports in 2010 amounting to nearly 12.7 million m³ of wood based panels per year, of which 10 million will be plywood & veneer, 1 million m³ will be MDF, another 1 million m³ will be OSB and LVL and 0.5 million m³ will be particleboard.
The Study also predicts that China will be 27% dependant upon imports in 2010, requiring a total volume of 10.5 million m³ of wood based panels a year, of which 4.7 million m³ will be plywood & veneer, 3.3 million m³ will be particleboard, 2.2 million m³ will be MDF, 0.4 million m³ will be other fibreboards and 0.7 million m³ will be OSB and LVL.
Republic of Korea will be 50% import dependant, requiring 4.0 million m³ of wood based panels per year, of which 2.8 million m³ will be plywood & veneer, 0.5 million m³ will be particleboard and another 0.5 million m³ will be MDF.
Taiwan Province of China will be 91% dependant on wood based panel imports by 2010 with a total requirement of 3.5 million m³, of which 1.8 million m³ will be plywood & veneer, 1.0 million m³ will be MDF and 0.7 million m³ will be particleboard.
The China, Hong Kong SAR figures will be included in the statistics for China, and Singapore's continued existence as an importer and exporter of wood products may have been overtaken by the development of newer 'High-tech' manufacturing and trading trends.

In Table 67, we have attempted to forecast the possible levels of production, consumption and available exports from the six major, timber surplus, exporting countries of the Asia Pacific region in the year 2010.
Indonesia, despite a dramatic increase in domestic consumption, should still have an exportable surplus availability of 9 million m³ in 2010, of which 6.5 million m³ could be plywood & veneer, 1.2 million m³ could be MDF, 0.8 million m³ could be particleboard and 0.5 million m³ could be OSB and LVL.
Malaysia will also have increased its domestic consumption levels, but could have an exportable surplus of 6.9 million m³ of wood based panels, including 2.5 million m³ of plywood & veneer, 2.4 million m³ of Particleboard, 1.6 million m³ of MDF and 0.5 million m³ of OSB and LVL.
Thailand, despite a shortage of large diameter hardwood logs, could also be a major exporter of wood based panels, totalling 3.1 million m³ in 2010, of which 1.7 million m³^ could be particleboard, 0.8 million m³ could be MDF and 0.7 million m³ could be OSB.
New Zealand, with an abundant and growing resource of Radiata Pine, will increase its role as an exporter of high quality panels, and by 2010 it could be exporting a total of 1.2 million m³ of panels, including 600,000 m³ of MDF, 230,000 of plywood, 150,000 m³^ of particleboard and 150,000 m³ of OSB and Triboard.
Australia is also a significant potential exporter of wood based panels to the region, with a possible surplus of 660,000 m³ of MDF by 2010, plus 100,000 m³ of particleboard and 80,000 m³ of OSB or LVL.

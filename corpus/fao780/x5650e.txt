Introduction
This document comprises two parts:
Executive Summary
Project Profiles
The Executive Summary is based on that which was included in the main report of the Country Mission Team (CMT). It has been revised to include more factual background information so that this document can suffice as a working document for the Roundtable III meeting. Where necessary, reference should be made to the main report for further detail on specific points.
There are twenty seven Project Profiles proposed for implementation over a five year period at a total cost of US$ 7,238,660. Of this, the Government of St Kitts and Nevis will provide US$ 1,285,260 (EC$ 3,470,202) and donor funding of US$ 5,953,400 is being sought. It is recommended that a rolling format be used involving annual revision and updating of programmes and projects.
Great emphasis must be placed on institutional strengthening. In this respect, training has been identified as the most vital component of the NFAP. This will be pursued as a core project complementary to the list of priority projects.

Executive summary
Background
1. St Kitts and Nevis are two of the Lesser Antilles. St Kitts has a land area of 176km^2 and a population of 37,000; Nevis has a land area of 93km^2 and a population of 9,600. Population levels are not growing so population pressures on land resources, forests and water resources have been modest.
Climate
2. For both islands, the climate is tropical marine, heavily influenced by steady northeast trade winds. There are only small variations in temperature throughout the year, the average at Basseterre being 27.8°C with maxima ranging from 29°C in January to 32°C in July. Relative humidity averages 76%, ranging from 70% in March to 78% in September, October and November.
Rainfall
3. Annual average is 1,625mm for St Kitts and 1,170mm for Nevis. However, the Southeast Peninsula (SEP) of St Kitts is much drier. Rainfall in Nevis is lowest along the eastern side. For St Kitts, most rain falls from August to November; the most rain falls in Nevis from July to January.
Topography
4. St Kitts has a rugged backbone dominated by the Northwest Range which includes three linked volcanoes, the youngest (Mt Liamuiga) rising to 1,156m. The steep mountainous interior is surrounded by an upland forest belt extending down to fertile coastal plains. The coastline is dominated by cliffs, with narrow beaches of coarse 'black' (volcanic) sand. Coastal erosion is a problem which is addressed (for Nevis) in project 1.14.
5. The 1,600ha SEP recently became accessible by a new road. It is a cluster of seven older small islets tied together by plains and marshlands. It has rather more steep slopes than the rest of the island. The highest peak is St Anthony's Peak at 319m.
6. Nevis is approximately circular and dominated by the central Nevis Peak at 985m.
Geology
7. St Kitts is seismically active with a core of older (Eocene) volcanic material comprised largely of andesite. The present steep central cone of Mt Liamuiga is made up of andesite and basaltic lava flows, agglomerates and pyroclastics.
8. Nevis is primarily volcanic but the oldest rocks are of marine origin. Away from the volcanic centres, Nevis is formed of sediments derived from these centres but the nature of the sediments is variable.

Soils
9. The agricultural soils of St Kitts and Nevis have been used extensively and intensively for over 300 years. Although the lowland soils of Nevis in particular show the ill-effects of this and other uses, the soils of both islands have stood up well to this long use. This is probably because of the rapid rate of fertile soil formation from fresh volcanic ash soils.
Vegetation
10. There is evidence of much disturbance caused by human activity. Agricultural crops dominate the lowland areas. The mountain peaks are forested but mostly this is secondary growth. Undisturbed rain forest is relatively rare. Five vegetation zones are recognised for St Kitts and described in the main report. On the SEP, the forest has been replaced by dry scrub woodland vegetation.
11. The St Kitts forest/woodland cover is classified:
rain and cloud forest
2,300ha
moist forest
2,100ha
dry forest
2,100ha
6,500ha
This represents approximately 37% of the land area.
12. Up to nine vegetation zones have been recognised for Nevis and these are described in the main report. Trees tend to be small due to the steepness of mountain slopes and exposure to high winds. Species diversity of the humid and rain forest zones is low.
13. The forest/woodland area of Nevis is classified:
rain forest
450ha
moist forest
450ha
dry forest/bush
4,141ha
5,040ha
This represents 56% of the land area.
Agriculture
14. Sugar has dominated agriculture in St Kitts for over 300 years and is likely to remain as a significant part of the economy. However, there is a new policy of agricultural diversification. Sugar production in Nevis ceased in 1969 and generally agriculture is in decline, hindered by social, economic and environmental factors. The soil is very difficult to work.
Administration
15. Forestry activities fall within the departments of agriculture of each island. The Department of Agriculture for St Kitts contains a Forestry Division; that for Nevis does not have an operational Forestry Division. The Country Capacity Project (CCP - project 5.01) includes provision for institutional strengthening of the Forestry Division in order to achieve the NFAP objectives. Great emphasis on institutional strengthening is essential. The main report contains details of the subprofessional and professional staff, support staff and facilities that will be required for the implementation and continuity of TFAP projects.
The Economy
16. St Kitts and Nevis seems to have done better than most OECS countries over the last decade. From 1966-1986, average growth rate was 8.3% per year in real output per capita (GNP after deducting inflation). GNP grew by 6.3% 1980-1990, despite the volatility of the sugar market, the impact of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 and the drought of 1990-91. Growth of GDP is very dependent on agriculture (especially sugar) but also on manufacturing and tourism sectors. Inflation has been modest in recent years. The long-term prospects for St Kitts and Nevis, with some provisos, are favourable. Heavy foreign indebtedness has been avoided and at the end of 1991, external debt stood at US$44 million, 26.4% of GDP.
The Contribution of Forestry to the National Economy
17. Forestry's contribution to measured GDP is very low, about 0.1% (1991). However, many forest outputs are not included in GDP and are not marketable. The forestry contribution to watershed protection, erosion control and amenity services is significant.
Economic Development Strategy
18. The main thrusts are: to maintain the sugar industry in St Kitts, to diversify agriculture, to encourage tourism and to encourage export manufacturing such as electronic assembly and garments.
19. The NFAP can contribute to all the main thrusts of the economic development strategy. Forestry can contribute to agricultural diversification through tree crop and agroforestry programmes (see proposed projects 1.03, 1.04). Tourism expansion is catered for in project 4.03. Contribution to watershed management (project 1.10) impacts on all objectives. Maintenance of the sugar industry by diversification is addressed in projects 1.08 and 1.15.
Imports and Exports
20. St Kitts and Nevis imports nearly all wood and wood product needs and a substantial proportion of agricultural and agroforestry needs. Exports of wood and wood products are minuscule; those for agricultural and agroforestry products are greater. Proposed expansion of domestic production is addressed in projects 1.7 and 1.12 for industrial plantations, project 3.01 for fuelwood fencepost and fodder plantations, and project 3.02 for split fencing materials.
Tourism
21. This is a growing sector, with numbers increasing threefold between 1982 and 1991. Hotels provide a lot of local employment and purchase local agricultural produce, though there is the potential for increased sales (see project 1.03). Various suggestions are made to ensure that the projected tourism expansion is beneficial.
Forest Resources Policy
22. No forest policy has ever been approved for St Kitts and Nevis. Revised forestry, wildlife and national park policies have been prepared with FAO assistance (Gane, 1988). A policy based on these is recommended for early acceptance. 'Imperatives' on which this policy depends and a strategic programme are presented in the main report. If accepted, the policy will require appropriate legislative support.
Legislation
23. The legislation operates in the context of the federal division of power between the Government of St Kitts and Nevis, and the Administration of Nevis, which is the political administration. Considerable problems of uncertainty in the law flow from the federal division of power.
24. The National Conservation and Environmental Protection Act (NCEPA) 1987 is the centrepiece of the federal legislative regulation of forestry matters in St Kitts and Nevis. However, it has almost no application to Nevis. An existing Nevis ordinance, the Housing and Land Development Ordinance (HLDO) contains provisions which overlap with those of the NCEPA.
25. There are deficiencies in these and other enactments, and twelve recommendations to address these are made in the main report.
Forestry Staffing
26. In St Kitts, several subprofessional positions remain vacant. The technical staff have no formal training so the proposed regional projects 01, 02, 03 which all include some aspects of training are very appropriate for a small country such as St Kitts and Nevis. In addition, training has been identified as the most vital component of the NFAP. It is intended that 'training' will be pursued as a core project complementary to the priority projects.
27. The work programme prepared for the first five years of the NFAP is modest in recognition of the financial and staffing limitations. No forestry officer, either professional or subprofessional, has ever been appointed to Nevis. It is imperative that a Forestry Division be created and properly staffed in order to implement the proposed NFAP activities. Additional office accommodation will be required in both St Kitts and Nevis (see CCP, project 5.01).
Factors Affecting Land Use
28. The main part of St Kitts is well suited to mechanized agriculture because there are few boulder-rich soils. The SEP is better suited as a wildlife area or tourist attraction. Landslips are less likely than in most of the OECS as there are few naturally unstable slopes but injudicious road and house cutting present risks.
29. Nevis has a large proportion of badly eroded or otherwise degraded soils. Many have considerable physical limitations, being either heavy clay over a hard layer or sandy.
Present Land Use in St Kitts
30. Recent aerial photography (CIDA) should permit better estimates and proposed project 1.02 'forest Inventory' includes provision for aerial photographs, but it is reported that 25% is for forest (probably underestimated) and 28% is for sugar cane. For the past 60 years, forest has been moving back into abandoned or less economic lands mainly at higher altitudes. Land use estimated in 1992 is summarised:
Type
Area (ha)
Area (%)
Forest
Woodland & shrub
National Park
Sugar cane
Other crop pasture
Unused agricultural land
Built-up area
Other uses
New agricultural land
31. The area of sugar cane shows a gradual reduction since the 1960s. A further reduction in area coupled with an increase in efficiency is being investigated. An IBRO/FAO diversification project is planning to establish over 400ha of new model farms.
32. There are a few (perhaps 30) commercial small holdings working with the extension service and producing some crops for export. The rest are for subsistence and number about 3,000 covering about 900ha. They provide for the local market and home consumption. Livestock may be kept and fed from surplus vegetables.
33. Erosion levels from bare fields is high. Good husbandry needs to be emphasized as in proposed agroforestry/livestock project 1.09. The use of contour barriers and tree barriers along ghaut edges should be employed. It is important to conserve natural tree vegetation in the ghauts and project 1.10 'Ghaut protection and stabilization' aims to prevent further gully erosion. For upper slopes in particular, a change to agroforestry systems, especially alley cropping, will be beneficial.
34. Mining of sand from beaches, dunes and ghauts is not controlled adequately to avoid environmental damage. Recommendations have been made but not yet fully approved by the government.
Land Use Capability in St Kitts
35. It is suggested that most land is Class II land where it occurs on gentle slopes, and Class III or worse southeast of a line through Conaree Hill. The range of crops which can be grown is wide. With the now declining influence of the sugar monoculture and the withdrawal of the SSMC from some lands, the most promising means of developing a successful farmer group is by establishing farms of 3-5ha on long lease or freehold with covenants governing change of use.
36. A State Corporation has been set up to administer the development of tourist based facilities on the SEP which is mostly privately owned. Project 4.01 'SEP Environmental Project' proposes to protect the existing vegetation from fire and grazing and encourage landscaping when development plans for the area are processed. It is recommended that the costs of water supply, effective sewage and solid waste disposal and conservation of the environment be determined to ensure that development does not prove to be an expensive mistake.
Present Land Use in Nevis
37. Nevis is rapidly changing from an island of abandoned agriculture to one of growing tourism, retirement living and new enterprises including agriculture. 1986 interpretation of 1982 aerial photography is probably still appropriate:
Land use/vegetation type
Area (ha)
Area (%)
bushland (forest, woodland acacia bush)
bushed grassland (acacia savanna)
grassland (mainly grazed abandoned cultivation)
coconuts (50%) and other tree crops
arable cultivation
urban
38. There is no systematic forestry. Uncontrolled goats and donkeys have reduced some areas of the south to a desert-like appearance, while green monkeys are a problem in the upper forest land. Relevant proposed projects are 1.14 (for control of donkeys) and 4.02 (for control of the green monkey).
39. Few landholders are engaged in truly commercial agriculture. They produce vegetables, fruit and honey for the new tourist hotels using a marketing information scheme developed by the Department of Agriculture. The OECS Agricultural Diversification Coordination Unit (ADCU) may assist other such farmers to respond to market opportunities.
40. There is a noticeable dichotomy between the (few) young commercial farmers and the majority of farmers who are over 60 years old and who produce to eat, taking small quantities of surplus to market and owning livestock that wanders freely.
41. Husbandry is generally poor and the practice of letting sheep and goats roam, which has contributed greatly to the degradation of Nevis, must be controlled. A project is proposed (1.11 'South Nevis coastland rehabilitation^/) as a pilot for redeveloping at least some of the degraded land. It proposes to introduce agroforestry with a timber, fodder mixed crop system, for small farmers.
Land Use Capability in Nevis
42. The predominant soils have been rated (Lang and Carroll, 1966) as Class III, gentle to moderate slope with many physical problems in use in spite of good chemical characteristics. Crop development suggestions are more limited than for St Kitts, but the range is still wide.
43. The 1987 land zoning plan has the force of law but there seems to be no effective method of ensuring that it is adhered to. However, it is not necessarily the most suitable plan. There are ample possibilities for restoring relatively intensive mixed agriculture.
52. The natural forests perform both protective and productive functions. However, it is essential that Forest Reserves be identified, surveyed and mapped. This is addressed in proposed project 1.01 'Forest reserve boundary line survey, demarcation and mapping'. The absence of clearly defined forest reserves has resulted in uncontrolled forest exploitation for timber, poles, fuelwood and other produce. The licensing system must be re-introduced to control this exploitation. A royalty system is recommended to obtain revenue from forest products.
53. A forest inventory must be undertaken for both St Kitts and for Nevis (see project 1.02 'Forest inventory'). Then, detailed ten year management plans must be prepared for each forest reserve. There are suggested inclusions for these plans in the main report. It is imperative that reliable data on the actual quantities of wood used for activities such as firewood, charcoal, fencing, poles, furniture, fishpots and non-wood products is obtained for proper planning purposes. The need for technical assistance in the areas of forest reservation, inventory and management is addressed in the CCP.
54. There needs to be a programme of plantation and/or agroforestry on the estimated 1-2,000ha of abandoned cane lands. An incentive scheme directed towards private land owners should encourage them to establish forestry/agroforestry plantations. However, any programme of plantation must address the pressing problem of grazing animals which cause much damage. Protective fencing is essential in the establishment of industrial plantations (projects 1.07, 1.12).
Agroforestry
55. There is tremendous scope for agroforestry development. However, the land tenure system does not give farmers land rights, consequently they show little interest in soil conservation practices and tree planting. With the exception of sugar, there are no secure markets for agricultural produce. Long-term planning, market research and market intelligence (as proposed in project 1.03) will be essential to the development of a successful agroforestry sector.
56. The problem of the almost total absence of plant propagation facilities is addressed by nursery development projects at La Guerite, St Kitts (project 1.06) and at Prospect, Nevis (project 1.13). When these are on-stream, they could produce about 20,000 fruit trees per year and support project 1.03 for fruit tree based agroforestry. Fruit fly infestation remains a serious constraint to regional and international marketing of fruits.
57. Diversification of the agricultural sector has so far shown limited results. Agroforestry can contribute towards increased production levels for fruits and vegetables especially on marginal lands using spatial or temporal intercropping.
58. The ecozone agroforestry approach is considered to be the most appropriate for St Kitts and Nevis and this is described in detail in the main report.
59. Legume/tree based agroforestry should be encouraged amongst small farmers as a way of increasing productivity. This is proposed as project 1.04 and should lead to an increase in soil fertility and a reduction in erosion rates. Fruit tree based agroforestry (project 1.03) should be adopted as the preferred land use system for hillside land with slopes of 20-25° and minimum soil depths of 20cm. This project includes a training component and calls for the establishment of ten 4ha fruit tree based agroforestry orchards.
60. Honey production has potential on both islands though it seems to be more developed on Nevis.
61. Land is in short supply so livestock integrated with the recommended tree crop agroforestry system may provide the best land use. Historically, livestock production has been the neglected subsector of agriculture. There has been a steep decline in livestock numbers over the past decade. However, the current systems of livestock production may be inappropriate for the future development of this sector. Project 1.09 'Livestock production in agroforestry' will establish test and demonstration plots. Demonstration of fodder production and improved livestock rearing in tree crop production will be project outputs. Project 1.14 for Nevis, integrated agroforestry/livestock' allows for the vegetation to re-establish itself at one or more locations by the use of fencing to exclude animals.
62. Forage legumes, particularly Gliricidia, Leucaena and Erythrina should be exploited more widely to improve livestock production in an agroforestry set-up. Some fodder may also be produced from project 1.05 in return for care of the proposed coastal area plantations. There is scope for utilization of some byproducts of sugar manufacture as feed for ruminants. Project 1.08 'Sugar cane as livestock feed' envisages manufacture and demonstration feeding of molasses urea salt blocks in St Kitts, with a similar project (1.15) for Nevis. These projects offer the SSMC protection of its basis for existence i.e. sugar manufacturing but also diversification.
63. Uncontrolled grazing is a problem which reduces the productivity of land and animals. Fencing is essential and project 3.02 proposes to provide split fencing and fence posts at a reasonable cost for enclosing livestock. In Nevis, there is a serious problem of 'wild donkeys' estimated to number over 1000. These are destroying the environment and control is addressed in project 1.14.
64. Praedial larceny will only be addressed when more farmers actually reside and spend more time on the farm. A leasing and settlement programme for farmers is stipulated for the success of agroforestry projects such as 1.03.
Forest Based Industrial Development
65. Import of wood based products is high, valued at EC$30 million in 1990. Logging in St Kitts is minimal and inconsequential. No sawmills have been established on either island.
66. Unfortunately, in Nevis timber felling for charcoal production is unregulated and uncontrolled. Re-introduction of regulations and enforcement of control measures is of the utmost importance. Hotels and restaurants obtain their supplies for barbecues from Nevis and large areas have been over-exploited resulting in serious degradation. Project 3.01 aims to establish 12ha of fuelwood, forage and fencepost plantations.
67. There are approximately 12 secondary processing manufacturers mostly producing for the local market. Poor management leads to under-utilization and idle machines. The use of unseasoned untreated lumber has limited product design and generally the quality of products is low. Project 2.01 is for the development of solar drying kilns and will satisfy the need for seasoned lumber at a low cost.
68. The handicraft industry is in a state of malaise, although there is a National Handicraft and Cottage Industries Development Board. Project 2.02 is for the propagation evaluation of three relevant species to encourage their sustained propagation for the handicraft industry. A training component is included.
69. The proper completion of a forest resource inventory is a fundamental pre-requisite for determining the size and nature of existing forest resources, and for assessing potential production capabilities on a sustainable yield basis. Project 2.03 is for 'Documentation of commercial species'. Forest based industries cannot be developed until the resource base is established to supply the raw materials. This is proposed for St Kitts (1.07) and Nevis (1.12). 'Establishment of industrial plantations' is seen as a contribution towards making the country self-sufficient in timber as well as reducing soil erosion and environmental degradation.
70. A logical follow-up to this is project 3.02 for the production of split fencing from poles and thinnings obtained from these plantations established at 10ha per year. The fencing will help alleviate the problem of uncontrolled livestock grazing.
71. The importance of establishing small commercial plantations is stressed. Project 1.05 envisages such plantations as a way of utilizing unproductive land close to the circum-island road.
Forestry Research
72. The separate report (Buford Briscoe, 1991) details constraints and recommendations. There is a need for a continuous forestry inventory which is addressed in regional project 02. Rigorous selection of seed trees and establishment of windbreaks are recommended. Regional project 04 'Meeting research needs in forestry and related areas' is an ideal way for St Kitts and Nevis to benefit from the assistance of a Forest Research Officer.
Wildlife
73. The fragmented approach to environmental administration, which splits responsibility for the management of forests, wetlands, beaches and coral reefs among various state agencies or corporations is, unfortunately, a key factor in the mismanagement of the environment.
74. There is a need for a database for site specific wildlife resource information and initiatives by the SEP Board will address this. All natural ecosystems in St Kitts and Nevis are endangered especially the forested upper elevations. In the Northwestern Range of St Kitts, all zones are highly disturbed. Activities include tree felling, harvesting of non-wood forest products and deliberate burning of gommier bark. In Nevis, construction of large residences in secondary forests above 300m is becoming a cause for concern. The NIA is taking steps to safeguard the forest resources.
75. There are few major wetlands but they are coming under increasing pressure. Comprehensive land use maps would be of benefit in regulating activities in these wetlands. In Nevis, cutting of mangroves and solid waste disposal are the most severe forms of observed abuse.
76. The African Green Monkey, reportedly introduced as a pet in the 17th century, has reached such numbers that farmers complain about damage to crops. Quantitative data on population numbers is urgently required and project 4.02 addresses this.
77. In general, the public does not appear to be fully aware of the benefits of conservation and the role that careful management of the environment plays in national development. However, there are around six very active NGOs doing valuable work which is summarised in the main report. The previously mentioned NCEPA is a magnificent framework for reducing the existing muddled approaches to environmental management.
National Parks and Protected Areas
78. The Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park (BHFNP) in St Kitts is one of the region's most successful restoration efforts of a major historical site. Proposals have been made for nature trails through the wooded areas of the park and it is recommended that proposals for developing the natural attributes of BHFNP be given top priority.
79. The mix of wetland habitats in the SEP can be an important component of the ecotourism and recreation plan for this area. It is recommended that all remaining wetlands of the SEP be declared wildlife sanctuaries. Other general and site specific recommendations are made in the main report for forested lands, wetlands, forest ghauts and monuments.
80. Embracing these recommendations is a proposed project 'Development of a system of national parks and other protected areas' (project 4.03). This project is of the highest priority. In Nevis, the proposed areas are Coconut Walk Estate and New River, and supporting reasons are given in the main report. In St Kitts, development of Wingfield National Park is proposed.
81. Development of the regulations of the NCEPA will be required. Top priority should also be given to the establishment of a secretariat to support the work of the National Conservation Commission as this is the principal agent for the execution of the NCEPA.
82. Species diversity and ecosystem diversity are significant in both St Kitts and Nevis. Priority should be given to the collection of data on the status of rare and endangered plants. Thus project profile 5.01 includes provision for a plant ecologist. An associated key strategy is the provision of herbarium facilities; project profile 5.04 has been prepared to develop this facility.
Ecotourism
83. There is considerable potential for ecotourism and government policy is to support ecotourism. However, this support needs to be expanded into a management plan for all the elements of an ecotourism thrust. A study of park objectives and management activities is recommended in project 4.03 for each element of the national parks plan. In the interim, management of selected sites could be carried out by NGOs, and communities around ecotourism sites could be paid as wardens.
84. Wildlife surveys are essential with regular collection of data being the principal goal. Training of young volunteers is recommended.
85. The recommendation for St Kitts and Nevis to become a signatory of CITES (CEP, 1991) is endorsed. The country has been cited as an exporter of illegal turtle shell. St Kitts and Nevis should also make every effort to become a signatory to SPAW and RAMSAR.
Social Forestry
86. There is both a population and labour decline with a shift of workers from agriculture to tourism. Unemployment is not a problem in either urban or rural areas.
87. The development of ecotourism brings opportunities for more people to be nature trail guides. More forest products could be utilised, for instance for handicrafts or construction, which suggests there is the opportunity for investment in forest resources production.
88. Important nontangible products of the forest economy are watershed management, and wildlife and forest protection. Several organisations involved in rural development activities are listed in the main report.
89. However, a significant core of skilled forest workers or harvesters is lacking. There is a dearth of skilled operators involved in timber processing. There would be the opportunity for farmers and other rural peoples to be more involved in forest based activities especially during the low employment periods in agriculture.
90. More Forestry Division staff are needed in both islands to deal with social forestry activities (see project 5.01). Social forestry activities should be integrated with agroforestry projects and with activities under the UNDP/FAO St Kitts and Nevis Agricultural Diversification Project. Training will be essential.
Public Education
91. This has been well handled and the major actors are listed in the main report. There are some constraints such as a shortage of trained staff, equipment and vehicles as well as special places where environmental education can be taught. Proposed projects 5.02 and 5.03 have been put forward to address the need for trained staff, and to upgrade the facilities for public education in both islands. The expertise of forestry public affairs officers is lacking but is provided for in regional project 05 which is concerned with public education and awareness programmes.

BACKGROUND
The National Conservation and Environmental Protection Act (1987) provides for the Minister, charged with the subject of development, in consultation with the National Conservation Commission, to establish forest reserves. To date, no such reserves have been established. These reserves are areas of forest land kept permanently under forest cover in order to provide wood and wood products, prevent erosion and flooding, preserve water supplies and provide wildlife habitats. The absence of clearly defined forest reserves has resulted in the illicit felling of timber and unlawful grazing of livestock which have resulted in serious degradation of the forest.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To survey, demarcate and map those areas identified as Forest Reserves in St. Kitts and Nevis.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Gather all survey and legal data on Forest Reserves boundaries.
(b) Locate all Forest Reserves boundaries in the field.
(c) Plot the data and produce maps of the Forest Reserves.

PROJECT TITLE:
Fruit-tree-based Agroforestry Project
DURATION:
Five years
LOCATION:
Steep slopes of 20° - 25°
BENEFICIARIES:
Small farmers, general population
BACKGROUND
There is tremendous scope for the commercial growing of fruit trees as is evident by the common sight of wild fruit trees in the ghaut areas and the multi-storied home gardens mainly of fruit trees. Despite this potential, there is little commercial development of tree crops. A 17 ha mixed fruit tree orchard established along commercial lines by the SSMC in the Wingfield area has shown viable results. In support of this the agricultural diversification study estimated that a 2.8 ha mixed fruit tree/vegetable enterprise would generate a net income of EC$19,000 at full production. The recently concluded FAO/UNDP Upper Watershed Management Projects in Trinidad and Jamaica have concluded that agroforestry using fruit trees mixed with food crops is the best land use for marginal lands with slopes between 20°-30°. The Country Environmental Profile indicates that 23% of the land area of the country is under similar slopes. This represents a valuable resource which could be best
used to support the current agricultural diversification programme. This programme is committed to the development of strategies to meet the increasing demand for local fruits and food crops resulting mainly from the expanding local tourism sector and from the development of regional and extra-regional markets. The development of plant propagation facilities at La Guerite and Prospect will facilitate the availability of planting materials for the project.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To prevent environmental degradation by the development of the proper land use for steep hillside areas with slopes of 20°-25° using fruit-tree-based agroforestry systems.
(b) To contribute towards meeting the increasing demand for local fruits and food crops.
(c) To generate employment in rural areas. 27
(d) To contribute towards the creation of foreign exchange savings.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Develop the infrastructure necessary for the establishment of ten 4ha fruit-tree-based agroforestry orchards.
(b) Establishment of ten 4ha fruit-tree-based agroforestry orchards.
(c) Provide training for Extension Staff in fruit-tree-based agroforestry.
(d) Provide training for project farmers in fruit-tree-based agroforestry.
(e) Establish a revolving credit facility to provide loan funding for project farmers.
(f) Establish marketing contracts with CMC for the purchase of fruit and food crops.
(g) Develop grades and standards for fruit and food crops.

OBSERVATIONS
The Government will be required to take the necessary action to enable the farmers to have proper land tenure. This is considered essential for successful tree crop cultivation and to encourage farmers to adopt practices which conserve the soil. The control of the green monkey is considered as essential for fruit tree development. (Ref. project profile 4.02)

PROJECT TITLE:
Legume tree-based agroforestry for small hillside farmers.
DURATION:
Three years
LOCATION:
Hillside land with slopes between 10°-20° located at Mansion, Molineux, Fahies, Wingfield, New River, Gingerlands, Maddens.
BACKGROUND
The farming sector comprises mainly small farmers who cultivate marginal hillside lands with slopes of 10°-20° which are located above the sugar cane cultivation. 90% of these holdings are under 0.2ha and are intensively cultivated with annual vegetable and rootcrops. The soils on these holdings are mainly soils which are subject to sheet erosion even on gentle slopes. In both St. Kitts and Nevis the top soil in virtually all of these areas is lost due to the past cleaning of lands for cultivation causing the exposure of the less fertile sub-soil. In addition to these limiting soil factors, agricultural productivity is further reduced by the lack of moisture and high soil temperatures during the dry season.
There is the urgent need to improve the productivity of these areas in order to meet the increased demand for vegetables and food crops caused by the ever expanding tourist sector. In order to meet this demand, it is essential that farmers employ sustainable methods which do not degrade the environment. Research work at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has demonstrated conclusively that legume tree-based agroforestry using prunings of Gliricidia sepium and pigeon peas, Cajanus cajan, in alley cropping spatial arrangements can contribute significant amounts of nitrogen to companion annual crops resulting in higher yields. Moreover, the results show that alley cropping using Gliricidia sepium can substantially reduce soil erosion by as much as 97% over traditional systems. Gliricidia is commonly grown in the country as a live fence. The practice of using Gliricidia prunings as livestock fodder is well known by small farmers but they are unaware of its
soil restorative attributes. Extension officers are generally not aware of legume tree-based agroforestry practices for improving soil fertility and reducing soil erosion and are therefore unable to advise farmers about these practices.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To establish viability of legume tree-based agroforestry systems for annual cropping on small farmers'^ holdings located on hillsides with highly credible soils.
(b) To demonstrate the advantages of legume tree-based agroforestry with annual crops over the traditional farming practices.
(c) To increase productivity in the agroforestry sector.
(d) To increase soil fertility and reduce erosion rates on marginal hillside lands.
(e) To increase the incomes of small farmers.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Development of eight (8) legume tree-based agroforestry demonstration plots. Each plot 0.5ha in size, using double hedge rows of Gliricidia sepium and Cajanus cajan with annual crops in the alleys.
(b) Training for extension staff and farmers in legume tree-based agroforestry systems with annual crops (alley cropping).
(c) Measurement of soil erosion rates from demonstration plots and selected farmers holdings.
(d) The production of multi-media packages (video, slide/tape, and farmers bulletins) on legume tree-based agroforestry.
(e) Development of model agroforestry farm plans with costs and benefits, for use by Extension Officers.

Project number: 1.05
PRIORITY AREA:
Forestry in Land Use
PROJECT TITLE:
Coastal Land Rehabilitation
LOCATION:
Coastal areas of Windward and Leeward, St. Kitts
DURATION:
Five years
BACKGROUND
St. Kitts has no accessible areas of timber trees. It does, however, have unused or poorly used land close to the circum-island road, mostly poor grass. This could be used for a combination of timber and fodder for local farmers or other purposes desired by the local communities. The areas to be considered are:
(i) in close vicinity to the coastal road from near Ross University to Old Road Town (5ha)
(ii) from Con Phipps through New Guinea to Sandy Point Ghaut (10ha)
(iii) at the coast near St. Paul's and inland between Belle Vue and Tabernacle (area to be determined)
(iv) in large areas on the gentle slopes of Canada Hills (could exceed 20ha) where there are abandoned dry fields
(v) patches of extremely poor canefields on stony dry land behind La Valle and Newtons (5ha)
(vi) unattended coconut groves (15ha) immediately west of Dieppe Bay.
This amounts to at least 55ha of unproductive lands, some at present actual or potential informal dump sites. It is proposed to select areas which are not the subject of present demands nor likely to be sought for other developments and use them to provide accessible timber, livestock fodder and amenity as a landscaping feature. The proposed woodlands should be mixed stands (neem + leucaena + acacia) and instead of rectangular boundaries, they should be like English parkland, provide interesting shapes.
They might well be combined with avenues of flowering/fruiting trees, along the Leeward at least.
OBJECTIVES
(1) Expansion of the area of useful and accessible multipurpose timber trees in St. Kitts.
(2) Protection of abandoned low productivity (dry) former sugar land from abuse by roving animals and waste dumping.
(3) Provision of some animal fodder to local villages.
(4) Beautification of the coastal areas and the circum-island road.
ACTIVITIES
(1) Rapid survey, using simple methods to determine area actually available and not already put to some useful purpose (present coconut areas are presumed not to be in that category, as are extremely poorly producing sugar). Inspection of soil depth.
(2) Discuss with local village councils of NGOs and farmers
(a) any local needs
(b) possibilities of local supervision
(3) Acquisition, where necessary
(4) Make necessary arrangements with FAO to produce adequate timber seedlings for 10-12ha per year for 5 years (say 30,000 seedlings per year). Also sufficient ornamental seedlings to plant 4km per year.
(5) Landscape section, so that the shape of the woodland produces an attractive appearance.
(6) Make arrangements with local farmers with livestock so that they can care for the plantation in return for fodder cutting.
(7) Arrange for permanent and intensive inspection - preferably by arrangement with local village councils or NGO groups.
(8) Plant ornamental trees as an avenue along the circum-island road.

BENEFICIARIES:
Forestry workers, general public, forest industries sector
BACKGROUND
Although several attempts have been made to establish industrial plantations in St. Kitts, most of them have failed primarily due to livestock damage and the absence of post-planting care. During the period 1987-1989 the country spent approximately $10M on the importation of logs and lumber for the construction industry and the furniture trade. This trend is likely to continue in the future. In addition to meeting the local demand for swan lumber, these plantations will have a considerable environmental impact particularly with respect to reducing soil erosion, improving conditions for agricultural development and improving water supplies.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To contribute towards making the country self sufficient in its timber supplies.
(b) To generate employment in the rural areas.
(c) To make savings in foreign exchange.
(d) To prevent soil erosion and environmental deterioration.
(e) To improve water supplies.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Produce an average of 26,000 seedlings per year
(b) Plant 20ha of Tabebuia pallida. Swietenia mahagoni. Tectona grandis and Cedrela odorata per year

PROJECT TITLE:
Sugarcane as Livestock Feed
DURATION:
18 months
LOCATION:
Bourkes Government Station, Franklands Estate and two selected farmers, preferably already growing sugarcane.
BENEFICIARIES:
Pig and small ruminant farmers; consumers of pork; and indirectly the general public through improved sanitation, reduced straying of animals and less degradation of the environment.
BACKGROUND
Rearing systems are poor and result in low quality, tethered or straying pigs, that grow slowly and pollute the environment. Use of the cane as feed and recycling manure to the crop will help farmers' earnings and may enhance their cane production to more economic levels. An improved pig and small ruminant industry based on a local, renewable resource instead of imported feeds will be of national benefit. Molasses Urea Salt (MUS) Block manufacture and demonstration feeding to small ruminants to be done.
A brief description of the system of feeding is given. The cane is crushed in small farmer operated machines of capacity half ton or less per hour. 50% of the juice of the stalk is extracted and this is fed to pigs instead of imported maize. Pigs drink just over one gallon per day and with a protein supplement grow at 300 to 500 grammes (up to 1.1 lb) per day. The supplement may be soyabean or a similar seed, fish or abattoir offal, or, even hotel swill. The hardy Large Black pigs and other non-descript animals of the population are likely to do well on this feed.
The pressed cane stalk which still has 50 to 60% of the juice can be fed to sheep and goats with Gliricidia or Leucaena forage, bagasse-based poultry litter and MUS blocks. A small sugarcane farmer could then add pigs and ruminants to his activities. This system, already spreading in Latin America, is being used at the Sugarcane Feeds Centre in Trinidad and Tobago and is expected to be spread through the Caribbean by the Technical Cooperation Project mechanism. This is proposed for St. Kitts and it is in keeping with environmentally sound use of the renewable resource, the sugarcane plant. The purpose of re-integrating livestock and crop agriculture will also be served. If the mechanisms could be worked this solution can help with the Conarees problem.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE
Set up an FAO Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) at Bourkes with collaboration of CARDI, SSMC and the Department of Agriculture and farmers working with the Sugarcane Feeds Centre (SFC), Trinidad.
ACTIVITIES
Write up project document, contact organizations including Feed Resources Group, Rome, through FAO, Barbados. Department and the Chief Technical Officer (CTO), FAO/UNDP, to discuss with government.

Project number: 1.09
PRIORITY AREA:
Forestry in Land Use
PROJECT TITLE:
Livestock Production in Agroforestry
DURATION:
Five years
LOCATION:
The generalised location will be in the areas of land below the forest line released from sugarcane for cultivation of tree crops. Some such areas are of Guinea grass and where suitable conditions exist, will be redeveloped into agroforestry. Other sites will be at land settlement schemes such as Bourkes Estate.
BENEFICIARIES:
The farmers by spread of source of income, the livestock industry, the general public, the environment by accelerated tree growth by use of organic matter, the prevention of erosion and improved water retention in the soil.
BACKGROUND
Tree crop agroforestry is a suitable land use for the steeper erosion-prone slopes. Plans are to promote this activity in the diversification programme. Soils are low in organic matter and eroded. Erosion can be prevented by use of contour planting of trees and grasses that can provide stakes, fence posts and fodder. The fruit trees will not cover the ground properly for several years. While they are growing, farmers can plant vegetables and root crops. An animal component that utilises forage from the soil protection barriers and crop waste will also provide organic matter for the plants. Leucaena and Gliricidia grown in dense triple-row plantings on the contour can be multipurpose in use. In areas where the fruit trees may be too exposed to wind, the same trees can be planted as windbreaks.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To establish test and demonstration plots at a few locations with the associated activity above. One location, the tree crops/dairy farm of Mr. Rogers at Bourkes, is a good early prospect for this activity. Since it starts with livestock and some fruit trees already established, it will show the end results/benefits to animals, crops, soils and income in a shorter timeframe. Other farms/locations can be higher lands at Greenhills Estate.
To establish grass and legume contour fodder banks using the desired species to show the benefits to the soil, trees and animals and the intensification of production that is possible.
ACTIVITIES
Develop collaboration with the farmers and between the relevant divisions of the Ministry under the FAO/UNDP assisted diversification plans. SSMC must be involved for their expertise in soil conservation, drainage, etc. and especially to tap their experience in their effort to utilise the slopes in crop activity over the years. Clarify roles and responsibilities. Select sites and implement.
EQUIPMENT/INFRASTRUCTURE
These are either in place or to come out of the Department's budget. This will involve use of personnel for part-time supervision and guidance, and limited resources e.g. planting material, transport, etc.
OUTPUTS
(a) Demonstration of agroforestry/livestock harmony and productivity.
(b) Land rehabilitation at lower cost and with greater economic value to the farmer.
(c) Demonstration of fodder production and improved livestock rearing in tree crop production.
NATIONAL LEAD IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Department of Agriculture, the Crops, Forestry and Livestock Divisions.
OBSERVATIONS
Staff will be part-time on this particular project but will be fully involved in the national diversification programme.
PROJECT BUDGET
Government contribution will be out of the normal operations, eg. for staffing,. Funds at levels to be decided will come out of that approved for livestock or for tree crop farm establishment under the FAO/UNDP Programme. The exact source will depend on the major intended product of the farm, i.e. whether crop or livestock is the major emphasis.

BACKGROUND
In general practically all the ghauts in St. Kitts are well wooded above the 300m contour. Below this contour line, however, the vegetation has been removed on either side of the ghauts and this contributes to soil erosion and the widening of the ghauts. The project will establish a mixture of fruit and forest trees on either side of every necessary ghaut in the country to a width of twenty (20) metres. Work will commence from the upper reaches of the ghaut and will progress downhill towards the mouth.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE
To stabilize and protect the edges of the ghauts so that further gully erosion is arrested and remedial work will be successful.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Production of 20,000 seedlings of fruit and forest trees

PROJECT TITLE:
South Nevis Coastal Rehabilitation
LOCATION:
South Nevis
BENEFICIARIES:
Nevisians in general, some potential farmers in particular.
BACKGROUND
In South and South-west Nevis, large areas of abandoned agricultural land are occupied by cactus scrub and acacia maintained by large numbers of goats and donkeys. In the areas protected from these animals, grass grows profusely. At the coast a low sea cliff is cut in the fragile rocks and is retreating rapidly. (During Hurricane Hugo, major loss of land took place). Close to the coast there is virtually no vegetation and clear evidence of both rain and wind erosion. In other areas, the sea cliff is shallower or a gentler slope and maintained by sea grape.
It is proposed to improve the stability of coastline, provide a number of mixed farms and turn the area, which is an eyesore into a potential amenity.
OBJECTIVES
(a) Select land for development and acquire it.
(b) Determine how much water is available from the coastal area.
(c) Develop a coastal protection growth of sea grape and other protective native coastal species.
(d) Develop a series of near coast multi-purpose forests to act as windbreaks and preventers of surface flow.
(e) Adopt a suitable agroforestry model or models in consultation with chosen operators and plan individual holding.
(f) Develop irrigation system.
(g) Maintain continuous contact with the operators.
(h) Develop monitoring.
ACTIVITIES
1) Survey coast from Sulphur Ghaut to the Figtree - Gingerland boundary to determine quantity of sea grape needed.
(2) Propagate and plant sea grape.
(3) Maintain sea grape
(4) Use resistivity survey methods to determine, with cooperation of the Water Department, where water is potentially available.
(5) Dig/drill well (s), estimate water availability.
(6) Determine the limits of the areas expected to be used for a dump, oil storage, etc.
(7) Select and acquire land from 50m inland of the coast road/track to the sea, or, where the track is very close to the sea appropriately further inland. Also, investigate suitable blocks of 50m for model for development and negotiate.
(8) Plan a series of narrow (20-50m wide) strips, landscaped, in which mixed multi-purpose trees will be planted (probably neem, pencaena, acacia, annonas etc).
(9) Arrange production of seedlings sufficient to plant 5 strips (40m x 1.25km; say 12,000 seedlings) with the FAO project each year for 5 years.
(10) Attempt administrative and physical control measures for donkeys and goats (pounding, contraceptive shots, killing jacks if necessary).
(11) Determine how many potential small farm operators may be interested and select for discussion of probable farm type and size. (Coordinate with FAO project concerning choice and objectives with respect to farmers. Coordinate with Department of Agriculture Marketing Information over crops).
(12) Develop farm plans. The basic plan is intended to comprise Leucaena/Gliricidia hedges for fodder, mulch and poles, coal, etc., with necus/annona field boundaries, inside existing stone fences in some areas. Between hedges crops decided in consultation as described above, with the choice depending on the availability of water. Farm will probably rear sheep and will use and cut fodder.
(13) Determine a satisfactory rate of annual settlement. Arrange with farmers to protect and use fodder from coastal timber strip.
(14) Develop an intensive extension programme in cooperation with the existing FAO programme.
(15) Determine the most suitable area to commence settlement (probably determined by water availability) and acquire.
(16) Commence development.
(17) Develop monitoring system adequate for local problem solving and feeding to be proposed OECS Agroforestry Information Network System.
(18) Coordinate with ghaut improvement project.

PROJECT TITLE:
Establishment of Industrial Plantations
DURATION:
Five years (Phase I)
LOCATION:
Maddens, Nevis
BENEFICIARIES:
Forestry workers, rural population, forest industries sector
BACKGROUND
All the sawn lumber used in Nevis is imported. In order to reduce the dependence of the country on such a supply, to save foreign exchange and to improve the level of unemployment in the rural areas, a programme for the development of industrial plantations is to be undertaken. Such plantations will also provide considerable environmental impacts especially with respect to the reduction in soil erosion, improvement of conditions for sustained agricultural development and the improvement of water supplies. It is estimated that at least 300ha of plantations can be established at an annual planting rate of 10ha. Species to be used are Tabebuia pallida. Swietenia mahagoni. Tectona grandis and Cedrela odorata.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To contribute towards making the country self-sufficient in its timber supplies.
(b) To generate employment in the rural areas.
(c) To save foreign exchange.
(d) To arrest erosion and improve water supplies.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Plant 10ha of plantations per annum
(b) Tend and supply plants
(c) Protect plants from livestock damage

Project number: 1.14
PRIORITY AREA:
Forestry in Land Use
PROJECT TITLE:
Integrated Agroforestry/Livestock
DURATION:
Five years
LOCATION:
The generalised location will be in the south of Nevis where due to bad agricultural practice, the land is exposed and subject to wind, run-off and sea erosion. Some areas are bare of any vegetation or are under undesirable Acacia spp. The uncontrolled foraging of sheep and goats and the presence of wild donkeys adds to the denudation. The area extends from South of Charlestown in an arc to Indiana Castle in the East. It is proposed that this project be carried out in areas between Long Point and Whitehall Estates. Success there would have a demonstration effect for the rest of the area and the nearby villagers.
BENEFICIARIES:
The land owners and farmers by the increased economic use of the land. The livestock and orchard industries, the general public and Nevis through environmental upgrading and the possible increase in number and species of wild animals present as productivity of the land is improved.
BACKGROUND
Tree crop agroforestry is a suitable land use for the erosion-prone areas. Plans are to promote this activity in the diversification programme. Soils are low in organic matter and eroded. Erosion can be prevented by use of contour planting of trees and grasses that can provide soil cover, fruit, stakes and fodder. It is evident that small holdings that are fenced to exclude animals are well-grassed and have trees that are growing. In contrast, the unfenced land, where animals roam freely, is bare and eroding. Effort has been made to settle some livestock farmers in need of land in the Low Ground Settlement area extending towards the sea. As purely livestock farmers attempting to graze animals, it will be difficult to achieve a satisfactory production level to make the small units viable. However, with fruit trees this may be more attainable. An ecological approach to the land rehabilitation is taken which will achieve ground cover using a mix of forest, fruit and forage
species, in the total absence of, then the controlled presence of livestock. The donkeys are to be eliminated or controlled.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To allow the vegetation to re-establish itself at one or more locations by fencing an area from ghaut to ghaut (natural boundaries) to the sea to exclude animals. At about $4,000 to $5,000 per km, the area may be decided on this initial cost in addition to the ability to exercise reasonable control. The village communities should be sensitized to what is being attempted and any jobs created should be offered first to them. After the fence is complete and animals excluded, any found inside should be impounded and disposed of.
To establish trees, forestry species and fruit, soiling grasses and legumes on contours and to act as wind breaks. An ecological approach will be taken, making use of the varying ability of species to survive different circumstances. Planting will be in bands or zones:
- sea-blast tolerant trees eg. sea grape, almond, tamarind will be planted near the sea with casuarina. Acacia and forest trees.
- immediately behind can be hardier drought and sea-blast tolerant, unpalatable leaved sugarapple and soursop planted on small areas of collected soil.
- there should be interplanting between the undesirable prickly Acacia and this should not be removed until some grass cover is developed.
- in the meantime donkeys should be rounded up and by arrangement with Ross University tests done to confirm or refute the Eauine Viral Arthritis allegation. If it is a problem, then animals may have to be shot to control numbers and used as animal protein as it is unlikely any country will allow imports. A programme to sterilize males could be investigated for subsequent control.
- the livestock farmers at Low Ground Settlement should be encouraged to plant windbreaks, fruit trees and fodder crops and to control their animals behind fences.
ACTIVITIES
Develop collaboration between the private land owners and farmers and between the relevant divisions of the Government of Nevis. The new propagator at Prospect should be contracted to supply all planting material and the Prison Farm at Maddens the fence posts. If necessary the plantings around Maddens may be expanded for a longer term continuous supply.
EQUIPMENT/INFRASTRUCTURE
Use of mechanical equipment will be minimised. However transport for personnel will be needed. The project is likely to be labour intensive. At the senior level the Forester to be employed by the Division will head the project with a management/supervisory multi-disciplinary team.
OUTPUTS
(1) Demonstration of agroforestry/livestock harmony and productivity.
(2) Land rehabilitation at lower cost and with greater economic value to the farmer.
(3) Demonstration that fodder production and improved livestock rearing in conjunction with tree crops is a feasible option and will make much better use of resources than the current practices.
(4) Improvement in the value of land and upgrading of the environment.
NATIONAL LEAD IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Nevis Island Council and its divisions with conservationists groups.
OBSERVATIONS
Most staff will be part-time on this particular project but the Department of Agriculture personnel will be fully involved as part of the national diversification programme.
PROJECT BUDGET
Government contribution will be out of the normal operations, e.g. for staffing. For the farms, funds at levels to be decided will come out of that approved for livestock or for tree crop farm establishment under the FAO-UNDP Programme. The exact source will depend on the major intended product of the farm i.e. whether crop or livestock is the major emphasis. For the more generalised rehabilitative work, grant funds may have to be sought from an agency or individuals. Funding required is estimated as US$110,000 over the five years at a rate of US$22,000 per annum.

BENEFICIARIES:
Pig and small ruminant farmers; consumers of pork; and indirectly the general public through improved sanitation, reduced straying of animals and less degradation of the environment.
BACKGROUND
Rearing systems are poor and result in low quality, tethered or straying pigs, that grow slowly and pollute the environment. Sugarcane will be planted along with Gliricidia. The Gliricidia will be densely planted in stands of 3m x 3m. The latter will be used while the new cultivation is being established. An improved pig and small ruminant industry based on a local, renewable resource instead of imported feeds will be of national benefit. Molasses Urea Salt Block manufacture and demonstration feeding to small ruminants to be done.

BACKGROUND
One of the projects developed under the National Forestry Action Plan (Project 1.02) relates to the conduction of an inventory of the St. Kitts and Nevis forests. This is to determine the size and nature of the existing forest resources and assess potential production on a sustained yield basis.
Very little detailed information is available about the physical and mechanical properties, natural durability, permeability, working characteristics of species which may eventually become commercially available from the resource base.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To provide for market promotional activities and public information, the recommended end use application (s) of commercially available species harvested from the forest resources of St. Kitts and Nevis.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Two month visit to the United Kingdom to research data that is available at Kew Gardens - London, Commonwealth Forestry Institute - Oxford University, and the Building Research Establishment - Watford.
(b) Two month stay in St. Kitts and Nevis for the compilation of all research material, printing, publication and distribution of the information.

Establishment of fuelwood, fodder and fence posts plantations in Nevis
DURATION:

LOCATION:
Maddens, Nevis
BENEFICIARIES:
Farmers and the general public
BACKGROUND
Although there are no accurate records of the demand for fuelwood/charcoal in Nevis, this has been estimated to be approximately 450 tonnes per annum. The wood used in charcoal production is removed from the forests. This has resulted in large areas of the country being heavily over-exploited resulting in serious watershed degradation. Trials in Montserrat have shown that Azadiracta indica, Leucaena leucocephvlla, Tabebuia pallida and Gliricidia sepium can be grown successfully for fence posts and fuelwood.
Since the Government is pursing a policy of agricultural diversification with emphasis, inter alia, on livestock production, the provision of fodder is extremely important. Experiments at the Sugar Cane Feeds Centre in Trinidad have revealed the Acacia mangium is an excellent species for this purpose. Since this species grows well in a wide variety of soils and climates there is little doubt that it will perform well in Nevis.
With respect to fence posts, there is a chronic storage for the existing livestock levels even excluding the need to combat the widespread problem of uncontrolled grazing.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) Establish 12ha of plantations (3ha/annum)
(b) Protect plantations
(c) Tend and supply plantations during first three years

LOCATION:
Selected suitable sites in Nevis
BENEFICIARIES:
Farmers
BACKGROUND
One of the projects developed under the National Forestry Action Plan (project profile 1.12) relates to the establishment of 10ha of industrial plantations per annum. A logical follow-up of this is the production of split fencing from poles and thinnings obtained from these plantations in order to control the serious problem of uncontrolled grazing of cattle and goats in the country. Split fencing has been manufactured by the Forestry Division of Trinidad and Tobago for about 40 years using the first and second thinnings from the local teak plantations. The fencing is produced in heights of 3 feet, 4 1/2 feet and 6 feet and in rolls of 25 yards. It is sold "untreated" or "treated". The fencing is treated by dipping into a creosote/dieseline mixture in a "hot and cold tank" method. This procedure facilitates a good absorption of the preservative.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To provide split fencing and fence posts (both treated and untreated) for farmers at a reasonable cost in order to enclose their livestock.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Purchase of machine for manufacturing the fencing and wire/staples
(b) Purchase of saws, axes, debarkers, files etc.
(c) Purchase of truck and preservation plant

It is important therefore that the land be improved aesthetically so as to coincide with the type of development envisaged.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
To protect the existing vegetation from fire and grazing and to encourage landscaping.
ACTIVITIES
Liaison with the Planning Unit in order to encourage the landscaping of property when development plans are processed. Liaison also with private developers to encourage the protection of existing vegetation from fire and grazing.

Control of the green monkey
DURATION:
One year
LOCATION:
St. Kitts
BENEFICIARIES:
Agriculturalists and the general public
BACKGROUND
A common complaint made by farmers in St. Kitts is that their crops are regularly destroyed by the green monkey and even at high levels of Government, it is felt that some control over the monkey population must be enforced.
Estimates of the monkey population vary considerably, with some people stating that the number of monkeys has outstripped the human population of the island.
It is evident therefore, that quantitative data on the monkey population is urgently required and that methods/techniques be developed to control them in order to promote agricultural development.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) Collect data on the size of the monkey population.
(b) Develop techniques such as to keep the population within a reasonable limit.
OUTPUTS
(a) Reliable data on the population of the green monkey
(b) Efficient control of the population

PROJECT TITLE:
Country Capacity Project (CCP)
BACKGROUND
The future development of the forestry sector in St. Kitts and Nevis will depend upon the capacity of the country to formulate appropriate strategies, initiate policy reforms, identify policy instruments and implement the projects identified by the National Forestry Action Plan. It is to be noted that the Government of the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, in recognizing the importance of its forests and in preserving a high quality environment, has fully supported the National Forestry Action Plan. It is to be further recognized that the forestry sector can play a significant role in the socio-economic development of the country.
The principal objectives of the National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP) are as follows:
(a) the protection, conservation and rational development of the forestry resources to:
- safeguard agricultural production and prevent soil erosion
- guarantee the supply of potable water
- protect the country's biodiversity and scenic beauty
- promote ecotourism
(b) to contribute to the economic development of the country by optimising the yield of wood and non-wood products from the forest on a sustainable basis and by saving foreign exchange through the establishment of high value plantations
(c) through agroforestry techniques enhance the employment and social well-being of the rural population while at the same time make a significant contribution to the country's food security through innovative programmes of crop and livestock production
(d) to implement a rational public education/awareness programme geared to all age groups in the society in order to ensure that the forest resources are protected
(e) to facilitate the active collaboration of the Government, the private sector and Non-Governmental Organizations in optimising the diverse benefits which can be obtained from the forest resources
(f) to facilitate the institutional strengthening of the Forestry Division, to achieve the NFAP objective, through staff development, provision of adequate facilities and an effective training programme.
The National Forestry Action Plan for St. Kitts and Nevis has the potential to develop the forestry and other sectors in a manner which can be of enormous economic and social significance to the country. The twenty-seven projects prepared for the short-term programme have an estimated expenditure of US$7,238,600.
This CCP is the vehicle by which the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis can initiate action in making the NFAP a success by providing the prerequisites needed for the implementation of the projects. The main activities will be:

BACKGROUND
The database on the flora of St. Kitts and Nevis is limited. Native and introduced plant species are being targeted for use in the handicraft industry, for horticulture, and for folk medicines. Identification of these plants is critical if programmes for their sustainable use are to be promoted. Rare and endangered plants remain un-catalogued, and conservation programmes for forest ecosystems require proper floral identifications. Development of the country capacity to meet these needs is a priority as it is necessary for the successful implementation of projects in other areas such as national parks, handicraft and agroforestry.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
(a) To construct facilities at Prospect for preparing and storing a plant collection.
(b) To provide a service for identification of plants in St. Kitts and Nevis.
(c) To house a seed and plant collection representative of St. Kitts and Nevis.
(d) To provide opportunities for the study of botany by students.
(e) To provide support for programmes in forestry, agriculture and horticulture, including the proposed botanical gardens for each island.
(f) To provide an essential link in the management of national parks.
ACTIVITIES
(a) Develop a site and building plan for the erection of a herbarium, 10m x 12m.
(b) Train two persons to undertake the following:
- Collect representatives of the flora of St. Kitts and Nevis

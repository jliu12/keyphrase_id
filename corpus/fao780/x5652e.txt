<title>National Forestry Action Programme - St Lucia: Executive summary</title>
<section>1</section>
Introduction
This document comprises two parts:
Executive Summary
Project Profiles
The Executive Summary is based on that which is included in the main report of the National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP) for St Lucia. The main report was produced as a result of the visit of the FAO/TFAP Country Mission Team (CMT - Appendix I).
There are twenty three proposed projects under all five FAO TFAP priority areas. For four of these areas, charts are included which clearly summarise the associated problems and objectives.
In addition to these twenty three project profiles, three core projects have been formulated. These cover the areas of: management of critical watersheds, agroforestry development and natural resources conservation and development, and are available as a separate document. The five proposed regional projects which were formulated after this document had been prepared, are also of relevance and interest to St. Lucia.

1. Introduction
1. The full contribution of the forestry sector to the national economy is significant and broad. It touches many sectors of the economy and most St. Lucians. In measured value terms, however, it is very modest. Contributions such as erosion control, watershed value, tourist amenity and ecological diversity are not easily measured but are substantial in terms of benefits accruing to the users.
2. St. Lucia has numerous areas of outstanding natural value. However, its ecosystem is undergoing rapid changes and while there is no apparent danger of ecological catastrophe at the present time, the fragile nature of its environment means that the ecosystem must be protected. The growth of population and of the economy in recent decades has meant that the natural environment is coming under increasing pressure from human activities. The impact of these activities is accelerating, and their deleterious effects are to be found in the loss of forests and woodlands to agricultural and other uses, the reduction in stream flows, increasing soil erosion and landslides, the destruction of coastal features, the pollution of rivers and the sea and the loss of wildlife.
3. These important contributions of the forestry subsector are being reduced by degradation. The forests are disappearing at a rate of approximately 1-2% per annum.
4. The future of St. Lucia's economy will largely depend on putting a stop to deforestation and other forms of forest degradation. The forest resources must be put under proper conservation practices. Consequently, the Government of St. Lucia has prepared a National Forestry Action Plan which covers a five year period and focuses on the five priority areas of FAO's Tropical Forests Action Programme (TFAP) methodology (see overview document).
5. The total cost of the five-year National Forestry Action Plan is estimated at US$12,090 million. Implementation of this Plan will be the responsibility of mainly the Ministry of Agriculture through the Planning Unit and the Forest and Lands Department (Appendix II).
2. Overview of the forestry subsector
6. The total forest area of St. Lucia, approximately 8,000ha (13% of the land area) constitutes one of the main environmental benefits to the island. These forests and other areas of trees are slowly being eroded by encroachment and misuse.
7. Analysis of the status of Forestry in Land Use indicates inadequate land use planning and coordination of watershed protection. Insufficient soil and water conservation measures have led to stream pollution, soil erosion and reduction of water retention capacity in the watershed. Much of this is a result of cultivation on marginal lands, poor farming practices and lack of land use policy.
8. In the area of Conservation. St. Lucia is attempting to bring under protection sensitive areas of biodiversity and to establish national park land. There is, however, no set policy as yet to guide conservation of the forest ecosystems outside of the Forest Reserve. There is also insufficient institutional capacity for regulation. Public awareness needs to be strengthened with regard to the benefits of environmental conservation and its impact on economic development, particularly in the public sector.
9. The Fuelwood and Energy priority area is a major contributor to wood use in St. Lucia. Fuelwood and charcoal are used by approximately 83% of households. While the extent of this usage appears to be decreasing, it still accounts for pressure on the existing forest and needs to be controlled and augmented by the establishment of community-based fast-growing fuelwood sources, particularly in areas where pressure on the forest is greatest.
10. Forest based industries are limited to woodcutters producing wood for use by the local furniture and building industry. The sustainable capacity of the present resource is not sufficient to support medium-sized wood utilization plants.
11. In the priority area Institutions there is conflicting legislation and areas where inadequate or no legislation exists, which needs to be remedied. Institutional assistance is also needed in land use planning and upgrading of institutional capacity in the lead institutions. This is most needed specifically in the area of natural and environmental resources regulation (Appendix III).
12. The National Forestry Action Plan is designed to strengthen the subsector's contribution to St. Lucia's economy based on improvements ranging from legal reform and improvement of regulatory capacity to institutional support in land use planning, improvements in forest management, afforestation and ecological protection.
13. Investments in these should assist in improving the sustained economic growth in the subsector and improve the ability to maintain a stable resource base for the land-using sectors of the economy.
3. National forestry action plan
14. The St. Lucia National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP) was prepared through the combined efforts of the Government of St. Lucia, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), acting as the lead cooperating agency, and the Overseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom (ODA/UK) which provided most of the funding.
15. During the preparation of the plan, policies and conditions in the forestry and related subsectors beginning at the community level were studied and analyzed for use as guides to the preparation. Based on priorities and objectives, strategies and programmes were formulated or presented leading to the presentation of 23 project proposals in the NFAP.
16. Planning capability in land use and watershed protection as well as legal and regulatory frameworks need to be strengthened in order to support the continuation of the plan process and implementation of programmes along recommended lines.
4. National development policy framework
17. While the National Development Plan is stilt in preparation, the following statements expressed in the objectives of the National Physical Development Strategy (proposed 1990) are relevant to the protection, enhancement and development of the forestry subsector, and to its increased contribution to the nation's environmental well-being.
1) To conserve and protect all essential elements and processes in the natural environment.
2) To conserve and protect all areas of outstanding natural beauty.
3) To limit to a minimum the adverse effects of all forms of development on the environment.
4) To improve the functioning of the urban environment through zoning, land use conformity and other measures.
5) To develop to their full potential agriculture, fishing and other rural industries.
18. The NFAP has been prepared and should be implemented within this broad policy framework as part of the Government's official development policy.
5. Plan objectives
19. Study and analysis in the preparation of the NFAP indicated that substantial progress was being made in the areas of resource conservation and environmental preservation but that there were a number of constraints impeding progress to meet the economic and social needs. Removal of the constraints and improvement of the institutional and legislative requirements will allow for a stronger participation in the management and development of the natural and environmental resources of St. Lucia and provide for a more interactive role between the lead institutions and the rural population and other resource-related private and public agencies. This will also provide the required flexibility for the successful implementation of the plan.
20. To implement the NFAP the following objectives have been set:
Overall Subsector Objective
21. To conserve and manage the natural resources for the protection of the environment and to obtain maximum utilization consistent with sustainable development and with regard to the welfare of rural communities.
Priority Area Objectives
22. Forestry in Land Use: To allocate appropriate land to secure a resource base for sustainable forestry and allied activities to ensure the protection of the environment, particularly watersheds, and to provide diversity for opportunities to generate income for the rural population.
23. Conservation of Forest Ecosystems: To conserve biological diversity and natural forest ecosystems through the establishment of protected areas, and to maximize their contribution to national development.
24. Fuelwood and Energy: To sustain fuelwood resources and alternative energy sources within the constraints attendant on the preservation of the environment.
25. Forest Based Industrial Development: As far as possible develop the management of the limited forest resources for maximum social and economic benefit.
26. Institutions: To bring policies and laws in line with national natural resource policies, develop an institutional framework capable of carrying out development requirements and to ensure maximum participation of the public and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
6. Development programmes
27. Programmes are presented in each of the five priority areas within the framework of the objectives presented above. The programmes respond to problems identified in each of the priority areas and are composed of specific projects formulated as "project profiles".
28. In the field of Forestry in Land Use, there are four programmes with a total of eight projects.
Programme 1: Watershed Management Programme
29. This addresses problems of deterioration in upper watershed areas with a view to remedial action and preparation of a plan for watershed improvement on a sustainable basis.
Project 1.01 Sustained Redevelopment of Watersheds
Project 1.02 Fond St. Jacques Watershed Management Project
Project 1.03 Choiseul Watershed Management Project
Programme 2: Agroforestry Programme
30. This is intended to address the need for diversification in marginal agricultural areas, particularly on steep slopes and in areas where pressure is being placed on the forest by landless farmers. This programme comprises three projects.
Project 1.04 Agroforestry Development
Project 1.05 Beausejour Communal Pasture
Project 1.06 Honey Production
Programme 3: Intensive Forest Management
31. There is one project in this area which plans to address natural forest improvement for future production and to bring management information and plantation maintenance up to date.
Project 1.07 Forest Improvement and Plantation Maintenance
Programme 4: Land Use Programme
32. This comprises a single project to deal with the problem of the acquisition, consolidation and redistribution of Crown lands and unused lands.
Project 1.08 Development of a Land Bank
33. The priority area Conservation of Ecosystems contains seven projects which aim at improving the ecological data base and protection and ecological conservation with a view to the economic feasibility of nature tourism. These projects are:
Project 2.01 Coastal Resources Development
Project 2.02 Proposal for National Park Land Development
Project 2.03 Nature Trail Development
Project 2.04 Herbarium Expansion and Development
Project 2.05 Bois D'orange Wetland Bird Sanctuary
Project 2.06 Wetland and Waterfowl Conservation
Project 2.07 Study of Wildlife in St. Lucia
34. As there is a sufficient but declining demand for fuelwood/ charcoal, only two projects have been developed under the priority area Fuelwood and Energy. Project 3.01 (Pilot Establishment of Community Woodlots) is presented to relieve the pressure on the forest resource in those areas of greatest need, and Project 3.02 (Biogas Plant Development) looks at an alternative natural source of energy for the small landholder.
35. The Forest Based Industrial Development priority area is restricted to only one project owing to the fact that the sustainable productive quantity of timber from the existing forests will only support limited local part-time industry. Project 4.01 (Cooperative Forest Industry) proposes the organizing of woodcutters for sustainable annual production of sawn material from the forest under management.
36. Finally, the priority area of Institutions includes 5 projects under three programmes.
Programme 1: Public Education Programme is made up of Project 5.01 (Establishing/Strengthening Environmental Clubs in Schools), a natural resource education project.
Programme 2: Institution Building Programme
Project 5.02 Land Use Planning Model (an immediate priority which is already initiated by the Ministry of Planning).
Project 5.03 Training in Conservation, Training in Agroforestry-Techniques for the SLBGA
Project 5.04 Strengthening of the Information Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture
Programme 3: Legislation Programme Project 5.05 Natural Resource Legislation
This project is an immediate priority, an "imperative" before the land use and watershed projects can be initiated. This project financing has been agreed by CIDA and the Government of St. Lucia; all that remains is for this to be passed by Cabinet.

BACKGROUND
The six (6) locations identified represent important watersheds in differing ecological zones within St. Lucia (Map 2). They are characterised by steep slopes, unstable soils, high population densities, heavy rainfall during the wet season, and their close proximity to water sources utilised by the Water and Sewage Authority. During the last decade these lands have been placed under heavy pressure by landless farmers hungry for land to cultivate high value cash crops, in particular bananas. The 'banana boom' of the 1980s has resulted in the cultivation by farmers of steep slopes categorised as unsuitable for agricultural purposes. The simultaneous depletion of the forest cover and minimal application of conservation measures by the users have led to heavy top soil erosion and noticeable siltation of the important water sources. It is therefore imperative that conservation measures be applied in these areas to reverse the destructive trend of the past decade (s).

This project must be linked to follow the development of project No. 5.02 (Land Use Planning Model) since approved policy directives will form the basis for strategies adopted during its implementation.
OBJECTIVES
Immediate
To demonstrate to farmers in the identified locations the use and benefits of agroforestry techniques.
Long-term
(1) To phase out cash crop cultivation on highly degraded areas.
(2) Universal application of approved watershed management practices by both farmers and central authorities.
ACTIVITIES
1. Select 5-10 acres in moderately to steeply sloping lands within the targeted watersheds, probably occupied by bananas, and obtain agreement to use for a period of five (5) years.
2. Analyse agroecological environments within which the banana can be grown satisfactorily.
3. Produce plans for each banana site which include full conservation and the introduction of leguminous hedges on the contour, with or without drains and vetiver protection, for a mixture with bananas initially and subsequently complete removal of the banana crop (which seems desirable). Produce plans for other sites to include an agrosilvo-pastoral alternative.
4. Demonstrate phased replacement of bananas using alley cropping system and a variety of other crop/animal use and other levels of investigation as appropriate, including low levels for dry scrub woodland areas and show income attainable.
5. Investigate farmer problems of implementing agroforestry and solve.
6. Evaluate costs and benefits of alternative uses.
7. Complete land use planning model (Project 5.02) evaluate previous projects, strategy and policies developed.
8. Review possible combinations of development options (a) within catchments; (b) among parts of catchments and optimisation in relation to achievement of policy goals, and any other constraints. Prioritise group activities/projects in relation to available funds.
OUTPUTS
1. Agroforestry demonstration sites developed within the identified critical watersheds (ref: project location).
2. Detailed plans developed for rehabilitation of targeted watersheds.
3. Final project choices made in relation to capability, need and readiness of target group.
4. Problem watersheds redeveloped.

BENEFICIARIES:
Fond St. Jacques farmers
EXECUTING AGENCY:
Ministry of Agriculture - Forestry & Engineering visions/National Farmers Association
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
Fond St. Jacques, a rural community approximately four miles south east of Soufriere (Map 2), has a population in the region of 2, 000. Like all other rural communities in St. Lucia, farming is the main source of subsistence for the members of households. The natural attributes of the region, such as a moist humid climate, good vegetative cover and fertile soils, apart from its steep terrain, affords this region the potential for tremendous agricultural output. As such Fond St. Jacques has been traditionally known as the "Food Basket" of St. Lucia. However a number of interrelated problems inhibit the area's ability to measure up to expectations, in terms of potential agricultural output. Foremost among these is the continued degradation of steep slopes, which is the characteristic of the area, during cultivation of short term cash crops, such as bananas and dasheen. If not checked immediately, this situation could have irreversible effects both on the ecology and
agricultural potential of this area, and as a direct result the income and survival of its inhabitants.
Execution of the earmarked project is therefore justified for the following reasons:
1. To conserve the fertile land resources of the area for the benefit of present and future generations.
2. To preserve valuable watersheds.
3. To maintain and increase farmers' income and livelihood.
4. To enable the area to live up to its reputation of 'food basket' of St. Lucia.
PROJECT CONTRIBUTION TO ST. LUCIA'S DEVELOPMENT
The project will contribute to St. Lucia's development in the following areas:
1. Assist the island in its overall agricultural diversification effort, away from its almost total dependence on bananas.
2. Contribute to the government's agricultural import substitution programme.
3. Increased agricultural exports, other than bananas, and improved balance of payments.
4. Protection of valuable watersheds for present and future generations.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
To devise a long-term watershed management plan for the entire Fond St. Jacques area.
Immediate
(a) to identify and improve conservation farming practices on all watersheds in the area;
(b) to provide farmers with adequate financial and technical support in order to undertake major conservation measures.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project will consist of the following major components, selected on the basis of their potential to facilitate realization of the earmarked objectives over the planned period:
i. Watershed survey
It is proposed to thoroughly survey the Fond St. Jacques area during the first year of project implementation. With the assistance of aerial photo interpretation, all perilous areas will be identified, classified and mapped. Additionally research will be conducted on land use practices and the land ownership structure.
ii. Reforestation
Immediately following the completion of the survey and the submission of the report, activities will be directed towards the complete reforestation of severely damaged areas, areas where viable agricultural practices have become more or less impossible.
iii. Agroforestry
An important component of this project will be the implementation of an agroforestry sub-project, utilizing tree species with a strong root system - citrus etc. - on less steep parts of slopes, while forest trees are planted on the steep slopes.
iv. Improved Agronomic/Engineering Practices
Farmers will be introduced to improved conservation farming practices, such as inter-cropping, terracing, drainage and the use of stream banks. They will also be advised on the importance of continually adopting such practices in the interest of sustained income and output from their farms.
v. Social Forestry-Medicinal Plant Production
In seeking to minimise traditional/intensive farming in the area, farmers should be encouraged to extend their thoughts towards creative economic enterprises which do not degrade the environment. To this end, a pilot scheme will be implemented to encourage farmers to cultivate herbal plants on a commercial basis. The pilot scheme will serve to test marketing and processing possibilities before embarking on a large project.
vi. Technical and Financial Assistance
Farmers will be provided with technical and financial assistance and incentives to implement the desired programmes. For example in the area of agroforestry, inputs will be supplied by the executing agency at a drastically reduced cost. Also, some form of compensation will be paid for loss of income during the gestation period of certain tree crop species, planted on land previously under short-term cash crops.

PROJECT DURATION:
Two (2) years
ESTIMATED COST:
EC$ 1,309,000
BENEFICIARIES:
Choiseul farmers
EXECUTING AGENCY:
Ministry of Agriculture - Forestry & Engineering Divisions
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
Choiseul, located along the south-western coast of St. Lucia, has traditionally been the major and most important source of sweet potato production on the island, for both local consumption and export, while extensive cultivation of other vegetables is undertaken during the dry season. The terrain which farmers have to deal with is characteristically hilly, low in top soil and nutrients and highly prone to sheet erosion during the rainy season.
Most farmers in the Choiseul area have no 'direct' titles to the land they farm; farming is either done on 'family' land or on land rented from absentee land owners. Although efforts have been made in the recent past to rectify these land tenure issues, the situation remains more or less the same today. Only a small percentage of farmers actually farm land completely owned by them.
Due to this high level of 'tenure uncertainty' affected farmers have, over the years, tended to neglect the use of improved agronomic practices that would assist in conserving the land's potential. This, coupled with the high natural erodibility of the lands in question, has resulted in serious and continuous erosion of the area's agricultural land base.
In addition to exacerbating soil degradation, the land tenure problems of the area have militated against approaches to agricultural and natural development of the area. Attempts have been made at soil conservation and evidence of this is still apparent. Presently, efforts are being made with the assistance of the French Technical Mission for an Integrated Rural Development Project in an area adjacent to the target project area. This project will have spin-offs for the target area if approaches are found for the land tenure problem, for meaningful crop and livestock farming systems and rehabilitation of the area.
Unless appropriate remedial action is taken, the future of farming activities in Choiseul could well be doomed. This will result in disastrous socio-economic consequences as alternative areas of general employment and livelihood are relatively nonexistent within the area.
PROJECT CONTRIBUTION TO ST. LUCIA'S DEVELOPMENT
In accordance with the Government of St. Lucia's development strategy of diversifying the agricultural base of the economy away from total dependence on bananas, the implementation of a soil conservation, and related development programme, within the Choiseul area will enhance the probability of this goal's eventual achievement. As has been stated earlier, farmers from this area produce large quantities of sweet potatoes and to a lesser extent vegetables. Once the erosion and related problems are contained the scope for a substantial increase in production over present levels is enormous. It should also be mentioned here that the activities of the 'French Co-operation Mission on Agriculture' in the Choiseul area have been severely constrained to date, because of the problems outlined within the foregoing problem tree.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
The overall goal of the project is to reforest degraded areas within Choiseul and increase crop yields over present levels.
Immediate
(a) Establish baseline data
(b) Demonstrate improved soil conservation practices
(c) Demonstrate crop/livestock management system to rehabilitate area
(d) Rehabilitate water course for improved water availability
(e) Reforest degraded areas
(f) Management of improved crop and livestock systems, soil and water conservation.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project activities will be conducted within the following most critical areas within Choiseul, namely Delcer, Industry, La Points, Morn Sion and Le Riche. The major components of the project are as follows:-
1. Baseline Survey
Because of the complexity of factors affecting Choiseul, it is recommended that a base-line survey of the entire area be completed initially. Completion of the survey would reveal the exact nature of the socio-economic parameters of which to be aware during preparation of development plans for the area.
2. Integrated Watershed and Management Plan
Based on the results of the base-line survey a watershed management/development plan will be prepared for the area. Completion of this component is critical to the future of Choiseul, since farming activities there could well be doomed unless appropriate remedial action is taken.
3. Stopgap Activities
While components (1) and (2) are being completed, temporary measures will have to be adopted within the area to prevent further deterioration of the land. These activities will be as follows:-
(a) Reforestation; Planting of selected forest tree species on slopes deemed unsuitable for general agricultural purposes; planting of appropriate tree species on banks of streams to enhance the availability of water from these sources.
(b) Agroforestry; Planting of selected tree crop species on relevant and suitable areas.
(c) Soil Conservation; Application by farmers, with guidance from extension officers, of improved agronomic practices to curtail soil erosion; construction of simple, low cost, agri-engineering structures where appropriate; field trips/demonstrations for farmers and landowners to selected pilot areas demonstrating soil conservation measures.
4. Technical and Financial Assistance
Farmers will be provided with technical and financial assistance/incentives during implementation of activities at (3) above. For example, in the area of agroforestry, inputs will be supplied by the executing agency at a reduced cost. Additionally some compensation will be paid for loss of income during the gestation period for tree crop species planted on land previously under short-term cash crops.

BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
'Agroforestry' has been recognised in St. Lucia and the other OECS countries as having the potential to contribute significantly to on-going and planned agricultural diversification efforts within the region. Although the term 'Agroforestry' may be new to many farmers and agricultural technicians, most of the tree crop species emphasised under related projects/programmes have been planted by local farmers for decades now in most of the islands, though not on a commercial or project related basis, with the exception of coconut and cocoa.
Projects and programmes stressing the increased propagation of crops such as mangoes, cashews, pineapples etc., now form an integral part of St. Lucia's Crop and Livestock Development Programme and the overall OECS Agricultural Diversification Programme.
More recently and within the context of the FAO sponsored Regional Tropical Forests Action Programme, agroforestry has been recognised as having an important role to play in forest and land conservation and watershed management programmes and policies within the region. This situation has arisen due to the fact that in general, forestry and agriculture, are in direct competition for the identical scarce arable land resource base. Since both sectors' needs have to be accommodated, in the interest of sustainable development on the one hand and the livelihood of the rural agricultural population on the other, the 'agroforestry' concept has been accepted as a partial solution to this dilemma.
Agroforestry based development efforts, in St. Lucia and the rest of the OECS region, can therefore be justified for the following reasons:-
(i) to contribute to the OECS sub region's agricultural diversification programme;
(ii) to contribute to the rational use of the subregion's arable land resource base;
(iii) to maximise agricultural output and incomes from available land resources;
(iv) the need to protect and conserve available (and scarce) land resources and valuable watersheds; and
(v) general macro-economic objectives of sustained agricultural export earnings and a diversified economic base.
PROJECT CONTRIBUTION TO ST. LUCIA'S DEVELOPMENT
Execution of this project will contribute to St. Lucia's development in the following areas:
(i) Assist the island in its agricultural diversification programme.
(ii) Contribute to the conservation of the island's scare arable land resource base in the interest of sustainable development.
(iii) Maximise farmers' income by tapping the potential of available and familiar resources.
(iv) Assist in import substitution and reducing the food import bill, through the use of locally produced products such as fruit juices and concentrates, jams and jellies and coconut based products etc.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
The overall goal of this project is to facilitate and effectively support St. Lucia's agricultural diversification programme and forest/land conservation efforts.
Immediate
The purpose of the project is to increase propagation of a variety of tree crop species over the next five years on an islandwide basis. These should have the potential of providing farmers with a steady and reliable source of income and should furthermore be valuable for the conservation of forests and land.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project will consist of seven (7) major components, selected on the basis of their potential to facilitate the realization of the earmarked objectives within the shortest possible time period. These are detailed in the following:-
(i) Rehabilitation of Coconut Plantations
This component forms part of an overall coconut rehabilitation programme in St. Lucia to be executed over a five (5) year period. It will involve the propagation and distribution of approximately 15,000 coconut seedlings annually over the allotted period to major producing areas in the north and south of island. Fifteen thousand (15,000) acres (6,060ha) are targeted for rehabilitation. The use of improved varieties and technology will be an integral part of the programme in an effort to maximise output and reduce the incidence of pests and disease. The coconut is an excellent agroforestry crop since under proper management, it possesses the potential to provide a reliable source of income to farmers over an extended period and conserve land in the process.
(ii) Small Ruminants Integrated System
The aim of this component is similarly to increase farmers incomes, while simultaneously demonstrating the viability of activities combining tree crop propagation and sheep/goat husbandry. It is proposed to establish a number of such systems on coconut and mango plantations in the north and south of the island and extend the experiment to the other tree crop species such as cocoa, cashews, avocadoes, breadfruit etc. A two (2) year experimental period will precede a full scale gradual expansion of this activity.
(iii) Cocoa Propagation
Before the advent of bananas, cocoa was extensively cultivated in St. Lucia and generally it is an excellent agroforestry/agricultural diversification crop. It is targeted to increase the acreage under cultivation from the present 600 acres to three thousand (3,000) acres (240-1,200ha) by the year 1996, in major producing areas around Castries, Dennery, Micoud and Soufriere. Attention will also be directed towards increasing yield per acre by at least 60% from the prevailing 300 lbs wet cocoa per acre to 500 lbs/acre.
(iv) Re-establishment of 'Exotic' Tree Crops and Indigenous Timber Species (Arboretum)
'Exotic' tree crops such as sapodilla, sugar-apple and sour-sop, can be used as agroforestry crops and furthermore, if properly organised, can serve as the backbone of exotic fruit juice supplies to local hotels and consumers in general. It is proposed over the next five (5) years to establish approximately 300 acres (120ha) of such trees in areas experiencing serious erosion problems, to enhance soil conservation and supplement farmers' incomes. Indigenous forest tree species have literally disappeared from St. Lucia, therefore it is essential that these be reintroduced. Areas tentatively identified are those around Soufriere and Choiseul in the southern part of the island.
(v) Cashew and Macadamia Nuts
Following the completion of a cashew nut pilot project in 1992, it is proposed to fully implement a cashew and macadamia nut propagation programme on the island. This fruit tree possesses excellent conservation and marketing possibilities and it is expected that by 1995 approximately 200 acres would have been established in and around Dennery, Micoud, Choiseul and Soufriere.
(vi) Pineapple Propagation
Pineapples have been earmarked for increased propagation since marketing possibilities for the fruit are above average, both locally and overseas. It has also been stated that the pineapple plant is recommended for soil erosion control in certain instances especially in highly degraded areas.
It has therefore been proposed to establish 100 acres over the next two (2) years on private farms at Dennery, Jalousie and River Doree. The programme will be gradually intensified as the required planting material comes on-stream during the subsequent three (3) years i.e 1993-1995.
(vii) Nursery Rehabilitation and Upgrading
In support of the foregoing programme components, the Ministry of Agriculture's Plant Propagation facilities at Union, Barthe and Beausejour Agricultural Stations will have to be upgraded and rehabilitated. Facilities will be upgraded over the next two (2) years to produce an estimated 20, 000 fruit trees, 30, 000 coconut seedlings and 50, 000 cocoa seedlings annually.

PROJECT TITLE:
Beausejour Communal Pasture Project
PROJECT DURATION:
Three (3) years
ESTIMATED COST:
EC$1,408,000
BENEFICIARIES:
Livestock farmers of Vieux Fort
EXECUTING AGENCY:
Ministry of Agriculture/Members of Co-operative/Brazilian Agency for Technical Cooperation
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
Just after World War II, an initiative was taken to establish a Communal Pasture Programme (CPP) in the south of the island, which made 200 acres of pasture lands available to landless farmers for cattle grazing. However, the programme has not been able to generate the desired impact on increasing meat and milk production.
Additionally the programme has had a negative impact on the environment although communal grazing was intended to reduce this problem and also bring economic benefits to the farmers.
Over the years the pasture programme has been heavily subsidized by government. However, budgetary constraints in recent years have made the government unable to continue funding the programme at the required levels. The communal pasture system itself is now degraded and therefore as part of the TFAP and for its success, the whole area and its animal population needs an intervention.
One way to stimulate local beef and dairy production and simultaneously address environmental concerns would be by providing support to improve the CPP.
Farmers have been very enthusiastic about continuing the project and developing it into a viable entity. To this end, the thirty five (35) farmers who keep cattle in the pastures have formed a quasi-cooperative unit with assistance of the Co-operative Department and officers of the Livestock Division.
PROJECT CONTRIBUTION TO ST LUCIA'S DEVELOPMENT
This project will contribute to St. Lucia's development through the following:-
1. Improving the income and standard of living of poor and landless rural people.
2. By demonstrating the use of trees and grasses in animal production, during transformation of the area into a viable entity, thereby facilitating duplication elsewhere on the island. This will lead to increased milk/beef production locally.
3. By training and demonstrating to farmers ecologically sound production systems.
4. By reducing farmers' dependence on government for financial support, thereby releasing scarce resources for alternative and beneficial uses.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
To develop environmentally sound animal production in the area in keeping with both the aspirations of the local population for economic return and good environmental management.
Immediate
To rehabilitate and reorganize the Beausejour Communal Pasture Programme to make it an economically and ecologically sound system.
OUTPUTS
(1) Establish pasture lands
(2) Plant trees probably utilising about 30-50 acres of the land holding in the following modes:
- shelter belt/windbreak on Eastern boundaries
- "park land" shade for cattle in pasture and milking activity/other activities area
- live fences to be also used as animal fodder
- fodder banks of trees in pasture
- improved grasses for grazing and with proper rotation and maintenance, reducing the level of land erosion
- improved grasses for zero grazing along the wetter river bank areas on the west.
(3) Farmers and livestock officers trained, experienced in and willing to take the techniques and production systems into the community.
(4) Demonstration of a successful livestock cooperative based on communal lands.
(5) Output of over 200, 000 kg milk and about 100 animals for beef per year.
ACTIVITIES
(1) Establish co-operative legally with entitlement to land.
(2) Contact between interested parties, namely MOA, CARDI, STAFCO-OP, Forestry Extension, the Co-operative Department and the farmers.
(3) Discuss plans with UNDP and Brazil's EMBRADA representatives who are interested in technical cooperation and in the use of locally grown forages for feed.
(4) Selection and propagation of suitable tree species.
(5) Implement programme.

PROJECT TITLE:
Honey Production
PROJECT DURATION:
Two (2) years
ESTIMATED COST:
EC$150,000
BENEFICIARIES:
Honey producers
PROJECT EXECUTION:
'Zimbabwe Roots' Farm/Ministry of Agriculture
BACKGROUND
Low output of honey locally has resulted in the importation of an estimated two (2) tonnes of this commodity annually into St. Lucia. Also because of the varying quality of local production, exports have been restricted mainly to French speaking islands. The aerial spraying of bananas has also resulted in the reduced population of plant pollinators, thereby further constraining production.
OBJECTIVES
Overall Goal; To increase income generation of rural people through increased knowledge of honey production.
Specific Objectives
(a) To double the number of hives in two years with commensurate increase in production replacing imports.
(b) To increase and diversify the output of beeswax for the local batik industry, replacing imports.
(c) To provide jobs/income for rural women as bee keepers, honey packagers/processors, the latter as co-operative activity.
(d) To support the agroforestry thrust in wider utilization of fruit and other trees suitable for nectar/honey production.
(e) Bees would assist plant pollination particularly as banana cultivation retreats from the more marginal areas and is replaced by fruit trees.
(f) To discourage by education the continued cutting of the local logwood tree whose flowers are a very good source of feed but the tree is favoured for charcoal making.
Expected Output; Rural jcos and at least two additional tonnes honey; beeswax; increased awareness of tree planting, pollination and fruiting.
ACTIVITIES
(1) General education and support programmes about bees in forestry/agroforestry in conjunction with Mille Fleur Cooperative and Zimbabwe Roots Farm.
(2) Agricultural Extension training abroad for one apiarist who can return to the Ministry and be based either in Forestry or the Extension Division to train locally two officers to be stationed in the North and South, and to train bee keepers generally.
(3) Supporting the activities of Zimbabwe Roots Farm and the Mille Fleur Co-op and activities such as bee keeping at the Boys Industrial School.
(4) Financial incentives provided to youth groups.
Training of 3 to 4 months for one or more officers and their salaries for training activities over the two years working with the Co-op and other agriculturists. Educational/Extension efforts will be provided by the Ministry, and the Co-op members will invest in facilities etc. A Zimbabwe Roots Farm member should also be trained.

ESTIMATED COST:
EC$987,800
BENEFICIARIES:
Landless farmers and Staff of the Ministry of Agriculture
EXECUTING AGENCY:
Ministry of Agriculture/Ministry of Planning
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
St. Lucia is a small island state with limited land resources and a relatively high population growth rate. The need for the agricultural sector to provide food for the population and to export for the generation of foreign exchange is becoming more and more important from the people's increasing expectation for material benefits. Competition for land from the other sectors for tourism, housing and industrial development is pushing up the price of land. Farmers and aspiring farmers are finding it difficult to purchase lands and when they do, they generally do not have the capital to invest in production. This results in lands being left uncultivated awaiting the highest bidder and cultivated lands with low capital investment. The sector is therefore characterised by low production and productivity.
Development of a land bank will facilitate the placing of all government lands under one management entity; determine the use of the land based on principles that are environmentally sound and provide leases to prospective users that are mortgageable and transferable. The bank will also be the assured first buyer, by law, of all lands.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
To put on all privately owned and government lands a farming system that is environmentally and socially sound.
Immediate
To establish a Land Bank to acquire, consolidate and redistribute lands for productive purposes.
OUTPUTS
1. Legislation drafted to establish the Land Bank

BENEFICIARIES:
Tourism Industry, Fisheries and people of St. Lucia
EXECUTING AGENCY:
St. Lucia National Trust
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
St. Lucia is experiencing rapid economic growth, particularly in the area of tourism. The emphasis on coast-based tourism has traditionally had tremendous negative impacts on coastal ecosystems. There is a growing interest in nature-tourism as well as ecologically sensitive tourism.
1. Development of these areas while preserving or emphasising their ecological, aesthetic, cultural and economic significance.
2. Evaluating the economic value of the resources in these areas in terms of present and potential output.
One of the most important coastal regions remaining on the island is the southeast coastal belt extending from Pte Caille to Moule-a-Chique. This area contains a variety of features including the two most extensive mangrove forests remaining on the island; reefs, sea grass beds and beaches, as well as a number of archaeological and historical sites.
The southeast coast ecosystems have traditionally supported a range of economic activities including fishing, hunting and charcoal production. In addition, the region as a whole has supported some agriculture. The beaches in the area have served an important recreational purpose.
There is a tremendous diversity of flora and fauna along the coastal belt. A number of species have been discovered which are unique to St. Lucia including the Maria Island snake and lizard. The biological diversity and variety in topography and geomorphological features make the area very scenic and interesting.
PROJECT CONTRIBUTION TO ST. LUCIA'S DEVELOPMENT
The southeast coast has tremendous potential for tourism, especially ecotourism, because of its diversity of natural and cultural attractions. Already there is some such activity though on a relatively small scale.
Esperance Harbour - Comerette region on the north-east coast is comprised of three (3) bays. A healthy mangrove system exists at Esperance with smaller ones at Anse Lapin and Cas-en-Bas. The reefs and sea grass beds at Esperance and Cas-an-Bas support thriving traps and conch fisheries. Lapin Island is a wildlife refuge. There is also a diversity of flora and fauna, especially birds.
Development of these sites into bastions of nature tourism will significantly increase the income earning capacity of the local tourist industry. Additionally conservation of these natural attributes will result in direct spin-off benefits such as conserving the remaining mangrove forests and breeding grounds of marine species.
OBJECTIVES
Long-term
Development of southeast and northeast of St. Lucia while preserving their ecological, aesthetic, cultural and economic significance.

EXECUTING AGENCY:
St. Lucia National Trust/Forestry Department
BACKGROUND
In October 1988, the St. Lucia National Trust initiated a project to develop a System Plan for Parks and Protected Areas. This project is partially funded by the United States Agency for International Development and is due for completion in September 1991. The broad technical objectives of the project are to:
1. identify representative samples of all natural and cultural sites worthy of conservation and active management;
2. recommend the most appropriate legal and institutional framework required for protected areas management;
3. identify the resource management personnel required;
4. foster and facilitate networking among government departments and non-governmental organisations;
5. increase public awareness of conservation issues and ensure public participation in the development and implementation of the plan; and
6. encourage and undertake scientific studies.
Unlike several other systems plans developed in the Caribbean, the methodology and process adopted emphasizes participatory planning. As a complement to this and to ensure consensus at different stages in the project, the Trust established an Advisory Committee which comprises representatives from twelve (12) organizations. They are:
- The Central Planning Unit
- The Forestry Department
- The Fisheries Department
- The Crown Lands Department
- The St. Lucia Tourist Board
- The St. Lucia Hotels and Tourism Association
- The Private Sector
- The National Youth Council
- The Folk Research Centre
- Caribbean Natural Resources Institute
- Parks and Beaches Commission
- The National Trust
Such a committee provides the avenue for compromise and enables the Trust to address potential areas of conflict at the initial planning phase.
To enable public consultation, the Trust has also held a series of radio talks which were structured to ensure public input. Presently, the Trust is also engaged in developing a multi-media programme and community consultation meetings on the National Parks Project. This is critical as it is important to understand that although the Trust is emerging as the National Co-ordinator for Parks and Protected Areas in St. Lucia, there are still several issues to be addressed. To develop any concrete projects at this time without extensive consultation with the Advisory Committee, is to go against the very grain of the participatory planning process. A project idea is briefly outlined below which is subject to modification.
PROJECT SITES
Currently there are two sites for the establishment of National Parks. They are the southeast coast of St. Lucia and the Soufriere Region.
1. Southeast Coast
The area has offshore islands, coral reefs, mangroves, wetlands and sea grass beds. There are also endemic species of reptiles on two islands offshore. The area is another frontier for extensive development in the near future.
The southeast Coast has several cultural sites and has been the location of a most successful experiment in community based resource management. It is an area where pro-active planning and action is needed urgently because of the potential coastal zone impacts from future development projects.
2. The Soufriere Region
This area has the highest density of natural and cultural resources per unit area in St. Lucia and perhaps the Lesser Antilles.
Efforts are underway to procure Cabinet acceptance for submission of the Soufriere Region for consideration as a World Heritage Site.
It is also an area which is targeted for several development projects in the future. The Soufriere Region like the South East Coast requires urgent attention.
PROJECT GOAL
The goal of such a project should be to implement recommendations of the National Parks Project and establish two National Parks which shall seek to conserve the unique natural and cultural resources of the area while developing ways for direct and indirect socio-economic benefits.
More specific project objectives are not detailed here primarily because such a project will require input from numerous organizations, and the objectives will gradually be formulated.
ACTIVITIES
The project must include several activities aimed at ensuring a holistic approach in the establishment of National Parks. The major activities should be in the areas of:-
1. Institutional strengthening
- implementing agencies
- community organizations
2. Public Awareness and Participation
3. Integrated Rural Development
4. Nature Tourism
- infrastructure
- interpretation

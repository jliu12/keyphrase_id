<title>Compendium of Food Additive Specifications (Addendum 7)Joint FAO/WHO Expert </title>
<section>1</section>
INTRODUCTION
This volume contains specifications of identity and purity prepared at the fifty third meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Rome, 1-10 June 1999. These specifications should be considered only in conjunction with the Report of the above meeting which will be printed in the WHO Technical Report Series. Toxicological monographs of the substances considered at the 53rd meeting of JECFA will be published in the WHO Food Additives Series as No. 44.
The general principles applied in the elaboration of specifications established at the earlier JECFA sessions have been published in the Principles for the Safety Assessment of Food Additives and Contaminants in Food, WHO Environmental Health Criteria, No. 70, 1987. The specifications of identity and purity of food additives established by JECFA are meant to identify the substance that has been subject to biological testing, to ensure that the substance is of adequate degree of purity for safe use in food, and to reflect and encourage good manufacturing practices. These principles were last reaffirmed by the 39th session of JECFA in 1992.
The specifications are mainly established for the use of toxicologists and others concerned with the identity and purity of the substance. As agreed by JECFA at its twenty sixth meeting, specifications may also be established prior to the eventual completion of toxicological evaluation, in certain cases, when the available toxicological data are inadequate or incomplete, and do not permit the establishment of full or temporary acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). References are made in individual specifications to some of the criteria that may be of interest in commerce, but they do not necessarily include all the requirements of interest to the commercial user. These specifications are not more stringent than is necessary to accomplish their purpose and should easily be attainable by the producing industries. The report of the twenty third session gives the reasons why certain specifications are designated as "tentative".
There were a total of 222 specifications prepared at the 53rd session of which 190 were new. One hundred and ten specifications were designated as tentative and one, calcium hydrogen sulphite, was withdrawn. The specification for ferrous sulphate, dried was separated from that for ferrous sulphate, replacing the previous specification, which covered both of these substances.
Comments and suggestions regarding this Volume are encouraged. Please send to Chief, Food Quality and Standards Service, Food and Nutrition Division, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.
NOTE: Use of (FNP 5) in specifications refers to General Methods (Guide to JECFA Specifications), FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 5/Rev. 2 (1991).
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The Committee wishes to thank Drs B. Whitehouse, consultant, and A. Okiyama, visiting scientist, FAO, for their assistance in the preparation of the compendium.

-ACETOLACTATE DECARBOXYLASE FROM BACILLUS BREVIS EXPRESSED IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Prepared at the 53rd JECFA (1999) and published in FNP Add 7 (1999), superseding specifications prepared at the 51st JECFA (1998), published in FNP 52 Add 6 (1998). ADI "not specified" established at the 51st JECFA in 1998.
SOURCES
Produced extracellularly by submerged fermentation of Bacillus subtilis, which through recombinant DNA techniques contains the gene for -decarboxylase from Bacillus brevis. The strain of Bacillus subtilis is non-pathogenic and non-toxicogenic (e. g. UW193 (a dal-transformant strain of ToC46) ). When fermentation is complete, the broth is filtered then stabilised before further filtration.
ACTIVE PRINCIPLES
-ACETOLACTATE decarboxylase
SYSTEMATIC NAMES AND NUMBERS
(S)-2-Hydroxy-2-methyl-oxobutanoate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.5)
REACTIONS CATALYSED
Decarboxylation of -ACETOLACTATE to acetoin
DESCRIPTION
Brown liquid containing the active enzyme; Total Organic Solids approx. 2%
FUNCTIONAL USES
Enzyme preparation
Used in the brewing of beer and fermentation step of alcohol production
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
Must conform to the General Specifications for Enzyme Preparations Used in Food Processing (FNP 52 & Addendum 6)

See description under TESTS
TESTS
-ACETOLACTATE decarboxylase activity
Principle
The enzyme decarboxylates -ACETOLACTATE to produce acetoin. The resultant acetoin can be reacted with a mixture of naphthol and creatine, resulting in quantitative formation of a characteristic red colour.
Apparatus
1. Spectrophotometer or equivalent capable of measuring optical density (absorbance) at 522 nm
2. Water bath, held at 30±1º, containing test tube rack
3. Volumetric glassware
Reagents
1. MES buffer, 0.05M (pH = 6.0). Dissolve 9.76 g of MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid) in approximately 900 ml of deionised water. Adjust pH to 6.0±0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 1-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
2. Brij 35 solution, 15% w/v: Dissolve 15.0 g of Brij 35 (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, Atlas Chemie, BDH, or equivalent) in approximately 70 ml of deionised water, heating to 60º to aid dissolution. After cooling, transfer to a 100-ml volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution should be stored in a refrigerator, and can be kept for up to two months.
3. MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution. Dissolve 48.8 g of MES and 175.32 g of NaCl (AR grade) in approximately 4.5 litres of deionised water. Add 17 ml of 15% Brij 35 solution (see 2. above). Adjust pH to 6.0±0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 5-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
4. -ACETOLACTATE substrate, 0.2% v/v. Pipette 100 of ethyl-2-acetoxy-2-methylacetolactate into a 50-ml volumetric flask. Add 6.0 ml of 0.5 N NaOH to the flask and stir for 20 min. Add MES buffer (see 1. above) to bring the volume to approximately 40 ml. Adjust pH to 6.0±0.5 with 0.5 N HCl. Make to volume with MES buffer (see 1. above). This substrate should be made just before use.
5. Naphthol/Creatine colour reagent: Dissolve 5.00 g of 1-naphthol and 0.50 g of creatine in 1 N NaOH, make to volume with 1 N NaOH in a 500-ml volumetric flask. This colour reagent should be made fresh just before use and shielded from light as much as possible.
6. Acetoin stock solution, 1000 mg/l: Dissolve 0.100 g of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in deionised water in a 100-ml volumetric flask. Make to volume with deionised water.
7. Acetoin standards: Dilute 0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 ml of stock acetoin solution (see 6. above) to volume with deionised water in 100 ml volumetric flasks to give standard solutions of 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/l of acetoin. These solutions may be kept for two weeks stored in a refrigerator.
8. Enzyme solutions: Test samples of the enzyme are diluted with MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (see 3. above). The exact dilution will need to be determined by experience and experimentation to give an enzyme concentration, which produces a result within the range of the acetoin standards (see 7. above) under the conditions of the test.
Procedure
Preparation of standard curve: Prepare a standard curve by treating the acetoin standards (7.) in the following manner:
Pipette 400 of the acetoin standard solutions into 10-ml plastic test tubes. Add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.) to each test tube, mix, and let the test tube stand at room temperature for exactly 40 min. At the end of this 40 min period, place 0 mg/l acetoin standard in the spectrophotometer set to read absorbance at 522 nm and adjust absorbance reading to zero. Measure the absorbance of the remaining acetoin standards at 522 nm.
Determination of enzyme activity
Warm the enzyme solutions (see 8. above), MES buffer (see 1. above), and the substrate (see 4. above) in a water bath at 30±1º for approximately 10 min.
Four solutions must be prepared for each analysis:
Enzyme blank (B1). Pipette 200 of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 of MES buffer (l.) into a 10-ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube back into the water bath.
Sample value (H1). Pipette 200 of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 of substrate (4.) into a 10-ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
Buffer blank (B2). Pipette 200 of MES buffer (l.) and 200 of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) into a 10-ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
Buffer value (H2). Pipette 200 of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) and 200 of substrate (4.) into a 10-ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
For each enzyme determination the test tubes, are prepared in the order: B1, H1, B2, H2.
Exactly 20 min after mixing of each of solutions B1, H1, B2, and H2, remove from water bath, add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.), mix and leave at room temperature for exactly 40 min. At the end of this 40 min period measure the absorbance of the solutions at 522 nm on a spectrophotometer or equivalent, previously adjusted so that the 0 mg/l acetoin standard gives an absorbance reading of zero.
Calculation
The activity of the enzyme is defined in terms of activity units where:
One -ACETOLACTATE decarboxylase unit = the amount of enzyme which, by decarboxylation of -ACETOLACTATE produces 1 mmol of acetoin per min under the test reaction conditions.
Plot optical density values at 522 nm for the acetoin standards against acetoin concentration (in mg acetoin/L) of the standard and generate a standard curve. Use the standard curve to convert the optical density measurements for solutions H1, B1, H2, and B2 to mg acetoin/L.
Activity of enzyme (in -ACETOLACTATE decarboxylase units/g) =
{([H1] - [B1]) - ([H2] - [B2])} x 0.0011351 x F
W
where:
[H1], [B1], [H2], [B2] = the concentrations of acetoin in the respective solutions (mg/l)
F = the final volume of enzyme solution, after dilutions (ml)
W = weight of enzyme in volume F (g)
The factor 0.0011351 contains:
the conversion from mg acetoin/L to mmol acetoin/min
the conversion for the actual volumes of substrate and enzyme solution used in the analysis.

CAROB BEAN GUM
Prepared at the 53rd JECFA (1999) and published in FNP 52 Add 7 (1999), superseding specifications prepared at the 51st JECFA (1998), published in FNP 52 Add 6 (1998). ADI "not specified", established at the 25th JECFA in 1981.
SYNONYMS
Locust bean gum, carob gum, INS No. 410
DEFINITION
Primarily the ground endosperm of the seeds from Ceratonia siliqua (L.) Taub. (Fam. Leguminosae) mainly consisting of high molecular weight (approximately 50,000-3,000,000) polysaccharides composed of galactomannans. The seeds are dehusked by treating the kernels with dilute sulfuric acid at high temperature or roasting the kernels, followed by milling and screening of the seeds to obtain the endosperm. The gum may be purified by washing with ethanol or isopropanol or dispersing in boiling water, followed by filtering, evaporation and drying.
C.A.S. number
DESCRIPTION
White to yellowish white, nearly odourless powder
FUNCTIONAL USES
Thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier
CHARACTERISTICS
IDENTIFICATION
Solubility (FNP 5)
Insoluble in ethanol
Gel formation
Add small amounts of sodium borate TS to an aqueous dispersion of the sample; a gel is formed.
Viscosity
Transfer 2 g of the sample into a 400-ml beaker and moisten thoroughly with about 4 ml of isopropanol. Add, with vigorous stirring, 200 ml of water and continue the stirring until the gum is completely and uniformly dispersed. An opalescent, slightly viscous solution is formed. Transfer 100 ml of this solution into another 400-ml beaker. Heat the mixture in a boiling water bath for about 10 min and cool to room temperature. There is an appreciable increase in viscosity (differentiating carob bean gum from guar gum).
Gum constituents (FNP 5)
Proceed as directed under Gum Constituents Identification (FNP 5) using 100 mg of the sample instead of 200 mg and 1 - 10 µl of the hydrolysate instead of 1 - 5 µl. Use galactose and mannose as reference standards. These constituents should be present.
Microscopic examination
Disperse a sample of the gum in an aqueous solution containing 0.5% iodine and 1% potassium iodide on a glass slide and examine under microscope. Carob bean gum contains long stretched tubiform cells, separated or slightly interspaced. Their brown contents are much less regularly formed than in Guar gum. (Guar gum shows close groups of round to pear shaped cells. Their contents are yellow to brown).
PURITY
Loss on drying (FNP 5)
Not more than 14.0% (105º, 5 h)
Total ash (FNP 5)
Not more than 1.2% (800º, 3-4 h)
Acid-insoluble matter (FNP 5)
Not more than 4.0%
Test 1.5 g of sample, accurately weighed
Protein (FNP 5)
Not more than 7.0%
Proceed as directed under nitrogen determination (Kjeldahl Method). The percentage of nitrogen determined multiplied by 6.25 gives the percent of protein in the sample
Starch
Not detectable by the following method: To a 1 in 10 solution of the sample add a few drops of iodine TS. No blue colour is produced
Ethanol and isopropanol
Not more than 1%, singly or in combinationSee description under TESTS
Lead (FNP 5)
Not more than 2 mg/kg
Prepare a sample solution as directed for organic compounds in the Limit Test and determine by atomic absorption spectroscopy (FNP 5)
Microbiological criteria
Total plate count: Not more than 5,000 CFU/g
E. coli: Negative by test
Salmonella: Negative by test
Yeasts and moulds: Not more than 500 CFU/g
TESTS
PURITY TESTS
Ethanol and isopropanol
Principle: The alcohols are converted to the corresponding nitrite esters and determined by headspace gas chromatography (FNP 5).
Sample preparation: Dissolve 100 mg of sample in 10 ml of water using sodium chloride as a dispersing agent if necessary.
Internal standard solution: Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l of n-propanol.
Standard alcohol solution: Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l each of ethanol and isopropanol.
Procedure: Weigh 200 mg of urea into a 25-ml "dark vial" (Reacti-flasks, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, or equivalent). Purge with nitrogen for 5 min and then add 1 ml of saturated oxalic acid solution, close with a rubber stopper and swirl. Add 1 ml of sample solution, 1 ml of internal standard solution, and simultaneously start a stop watch (T=0). Swirl the vial and recap with an open screw cap fitted with a silicone rubber septum. Swirl until T=30 sec. At T=45 sec inject through the septum 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (250 g/l). Swirl until T=70 sec and at T=150 sec withdraw through the septum 1 ml of the headspace using a pressure lock syringe (Precision Sampling Corp., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA, or equivalent.
Gas chromatography: Insert syringe needle in the injection port; precompress the sample, then open the syringe and inject the sample.
Use the following conditions:
- Column: glass (4mm i.d., 90 cm)
- Packing: first 15 cm packed with chrompack (or equivalent) and the remainder with Porapak R 120-150 mesh (or equivalent)
- Carrier gas: nitrogen (flow rate: 80 ml/min)
- Detector: flame ionization
- Temperatures: injection port: 250º; column: 150º isothermal
Calculation: Quantify the ethanol and isopropanol present in the sample by comparing the peak areas with the corresponding peaks obtained by chromatographing the headspace produced by substituting in the procedure 1 ml of Standard alcohol solution for 1 ml of Sample solution.
Microbiological criteria
Total plate count: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample into 99 ml of phosphate buffer and use a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve. Limit dissolving time to about 10 min and then pipette 1 ml of the solution into separate, duplicate, appropriately marked petri dishes. Pour over the aliquot of sample in each petri dish 12-15 ml of Plate Count Agar previously tempered to 44-46°. Mix well by alternate rotation and back and forth motion of the plates, allow the agar to solidify. Invert the plates and incubate for 48±2 h at 35±1°.
After incubation count the growing colonies visible on each plate and record the number of colonies. Take the average of both plates, and multiply by the sample dilution factor, 100. Where no colonies are visible, express the result as less than 100 CFU/g.
E. coli determination: The use of cellulase to degrade the gum sample prior to analysis is essential in order to avoid gelling of the gum during its addition to the enrichment broth. Prepare a 1.0% cellulase solution (1 g cellulase to 99 ml water) and sterilize by filtration through a 0.45 µm membrane. (Cellulase solution may be stored at 2-5° for up to two weeks.) Into a sterile tube containing 9 ml of sterile lauryl sulfate tryptose (LST) broth, aseptically add 0.1 ml of the sterile 1% cellulase solution. Add 1g gum sample to the tube and vortex vigorously to disperse the sample. Incubate the tube for 24-48 h at 35±1°. After 24 h, gently agitate the tube and examine for gas production, i.e., effervescence. Reincubate for an additional 24 hours if no gas evolution is observed. Examine a second time for gas. Perform the following confirmation test on the presumptive positive (gassing) result.
Gently agitate the gassing LST tube and transfer one loopful of the suspension to a tube containing 10 ml of EC broth and a fermentation (Durham) vial. Incubate the EC tube for 24-48 h at 45.5±0.2°. After 24 h, examine for gas production; if negative, examine again at 48 h. Streak a loopful of the suspension from the gassing tube onto L-EMB agar. It is essential that one portion of the plate exhibit well-separated colonies. Incubate 18-24 h at 35°. Examine the plates for colonies typical of E. coli, i.e., dark-centered with or without metallic sheen. Select two presumptively positive colonies and transfer them to PCA agar slants for morphological and biochemical tests. Incubate PCA slants for 18-24 h at 35±1°, then perform a Gram stain on the culture.
If the culture is Gram-negative (short rods) perform either of the following two biochemical test schemes:
Scheme1. A. Tests for IMViC biochemical activity:
a. Indole production: Inoculate a tube of tryptone broth and incubate 24 h at 35°. Test for indole by adding 0.2-0.3 ml Kovacs' reagent. Appearance of a distinct red colour in the upper layer is a positive test.
b. Voges-Proskauer-reactive compounds: Inoculate a tube of MR-VP broth and incubate 48 h at 35°. Transfer 1 ml to a 13 x100 mm tube. Add 0.6 ml alpha-naphthol solution and 0.2 ml 40% KOH, and shake. Add a few crystals of creatine. Shake and let stand 2 h. Test is positive if eosin pink colour develops.
c. Methyl red-reactive compounds: Incubate the MR-VP tube from the Voges-Proskauer test an additional 48 h at 35°. Add 5 drops of methyl red solution to each tube. A distinct red colour is a positive test. A yellow colour is negative.
d. Use of citrate: Lightly inoculate a tube of Koser's citrate broth; avoid detectable turbidity. Incubate at 35° for 96 h. Development of distinct turbidity is positive reaction.
Scheme1.B. Using the growth from the PCA slants, re-inoculate a tube of LST broth containing a Durham vial and incubate at 35° for 48 h to verify that the isolate has the ability to produce acid and gas from the fermentation of lactose.
Interpretation: Cultures that (a) produce gas as a result of the inoculation of LST broth and subsequent incubation for 24-48 h at 35°, (b) appear as Gram-negative non-spore-forming rods, and (c) give IMViC patterns ++-- (biotype 1) or -+-- (biotype 2), are considered to be E. coli.
Scheme 2. Disperse any colony growth into a small volume of 0.85% saline. Confirmation of the identity of the bacterial growth by chemical tests is conveniently done using API 20E or Micro ID strips or equivalent systems. After completion of the tests, identify the organism from the Identification Manual of the system used and record the final result.
Salmonella determination: The use of cellulase to degrade the gum sample prior to analysis is essential in order to avoid gelling of the gum during its addition to the enrichment medium. Prepare a 1.0% cellulase solution (1 g cellulase to 99 ml water) and sterilize by filtration through a 0.45 µm membrane. (The cellulase solution may be stored at 2-5° for up to two weeks.) Aseptically weigh 25 g of sample into a sterile beaker (250 ml) or other appropriate container. Into a sterile, wide mouth, screw-cap jar (500 ml) or other appropriate container, introduce 225 ml of sterile lactose broth and 2.25 ml sterile 1% cellulase solution. While vigorously stirring the cellulase/lactose broth with a magnetic stirrer, quickly transfer the 25 g sample through a sterile glass funnel into the cellulase/lactose broth. Cap jar securely and let stand 60 min at room temperature. Loosen the cap and incubate the container at 35±1° for 24±2 h.
Tighten lid and gently shake incubated sample mixture; transfer 1 ml mixture to 10 ml Selenite cystine (SC) broth and another 1 ml mixture to 10 ml Tetrathionate (TT) broth. Incubate 24±2 h at 35°. Mix (vortex, if tube) and streak a 3 mm loopful incubated TT broth on Bismuth sulfite (BS) agar, xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar, and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar. (Prepare BS plates the day before streaking and store in dark at room temperature until streaked.) Repeat with a 3-mm loopful of SC broth. Incubate plates 24±2 h at 35°. Continue as indicated on pages 221-226 of the Guide to Specifications, FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 5 Revision 2, Rome 1991, "Examine plates for presence of colonies ...".
Yeasts and moulds: Weigh 25 g of sample and add to 2475 ml of sterile 0.1% peptone water (prepared by adding 1 g of peptone to 1 liter of distilled water, mixing to dissolve peptone, and autoclaving at 121° for 15 min) while vigorously stirring with a magnetic stirrer. Stir until the sample is completely dissolved. This is a 1:100 dilution. Aseptically pipette 0.1 ml to each of 10 pre-poured, solidified CCPDA-D plates (see below). Spread inoculum evenly over the surface of the plates using a sterile, bent glass rod. Incubate plates in the upright position at 25° undisturbed for 5 days.
After incubation, count the growing colonies on each plate using a colony counter and record the total number of colonies present on the 10 plates. Separate the yeasts from the moulds according to their morphology and count them separately. Take the total number of colonies present in all 10 plates and multiply by 100 to obtain the CFU/g of sample. If none of the plates shows growth, express the result as less than 100 CFU/g.
CCPDA-D medium: First, prepare a 2% dichloran (2,6-dichloran-4-nitroaniline) stock solution in 95% ethanol. Then, to PDA, add a quantity of the dichloran stock solution sufficient to give a concentration of 2.5 mg/l. Add chloramphenicol to a concentration of 50 mg/l and autoclave at 121° for 15 min. Cool medium to about 50° and just before pouring the plates, add sufficient filter-sterilized chlortetracycline to give a concentration of 50 mg/l.

Connect the injector outlet to the column inlet, and connect the column outlet directly to waste. Activate the pump and elute the system at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Set the pressure limit control to about 15 kgf/cm^2 above the normal operating pressure. Increase the flow rate by increments of 0.1 ml/min up to the operating rate, and elute the column for 2 hours. Connect the column outlet to the detector tube, flush both the reference and sample cells for 30 min, and then zero the refractometer and adjust the sensitivity
System Suitability Test
The area responses of triplicate 30-µl injections of the Standard Solution show a relative standard deviation (100 × standard deviation/mean peak area) of not more than 1.0%.
Procedure
Chromatograph triplicate 30-µl portions of the Standard Solution and record the mean of the erythritol peak areas as A. In a similar manner, chromatograph triplicate 30-µl portions of the Assay Solution and record the mean of the erythritol peak areas as a. Calculate the percentage of erythritol in the sample by the formula: % Erythritol = 100(W/w)(a/A).

SYNONYMS
Gum cyamopsis, guar flour; INS No. 412
DEFINITION
Primarily the ground endosperm of the seeds from Cyamopsis tetragonolobus (L.) Taub., (Fam. Leguminosae) consisting mainly of polysaccharides of high molecular weight (50,000-8,000,000), composed of galactomannans; mannose: galactose ratio is about 2:1. The gum may be purified by washing with ethanol or isopropanol or dispersing in boiling water, followed by filtering, evaporation and drying.
C.A.S. number
DESCRIPTION
White to yellowish-white, nearly odourless, free-flowing powder
FUNCTIONAL USES
Thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier
CHARACTERISTICS
IDENTIFICATION
Gel formation
Add small amounts of sodium borate TS to an aqueous dispersion of the sample; a gel is formed.
Viscosity
Transfer 2 g of the sample into a 400-ml beaker and moisten thoroughly with about 4 ml of isopropanol. Add, with vigorous stirring, 200 ml of water and continue the stirring until the gum is completely and uniformly dispersed. An opalescent, viscous solution is formed. Transfer 100 ml of this solution into another 400-ml beaker, heat the mixture in a boiling water bath for about 10 min and cool to room temperature. There is no substantial increase in viscosity (differentiating guar gum from carob bean gum).
Gum constituents (FNP 5)
Proceed as directed under Gum Constituents Identification (FNP 5) using 100 mg of the sample instead of 200 mg and 1 - 10 µl of the hydrolysate instead of 1 - 5 µl. Use galactose and mannose as reference standards. These constituents should be present.
Microscopic examination
Place some ground sample in an aqueous solution containing 0.5% iodine and 1% potassium iodide on a glass slide and examine under microscope. Guar gum shows close groups of round to pear formed cells, their contents being yellow to brown. (Carob bean gum contains long stretched tubiform cells, separated or slightly interspaced. Their brown contents are much less regularly formed than in guar gum).
PURITY
Loss on drying (FNP 5)
Not more than 15.0% (105°, 5 h)

Ethanol and isopropanol
Principle: The alcohols are converted to the corresponding nitrite esters and determined by headspace gas chromatography (FNP 5).
Sample preparation: Dissolve 100 mg of sample in 10 ml of water using sodium chloride as a dispersing agent if necessary.
Internal standard solution: Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l of n-propanol.
Standard alcohol solution: Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l each of ethanol and isopropanol.
Procedure: Weigh 200 mg of urea into a 25-ml "dark vial" (Reacti-flasks, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, or equivalent). Purge with nitrogen for 5 min and then add 1 ml of saturated oxalic acid solution, close with a rubber stopper and swirl. Add 1 ml of sample solution, 1 ml of internal standard solution, and simultaneously start a stop watch (T=0). Swirl the vial and recap with an open screw cap fitted with a silicone rubber septum. Swirl until T=30 sec. At T=45 sec inject through the septum 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (250 g/l). Swirl until T=70 sec and at T=150 sec withdraw through the septum 1 ml of the headspace using a pressure lock syringe (Precision Sampling Corp., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA), or equivalent.
Gas chromatography: Insert syringe needle in the injection port; precompress the sample, then open the syringe and inject the sample.
Use the following conditions:
- Column: glass (4mm i.d., 90 cm)
- Packing: first 15 cm packed with chrompack (or equivalent) and the remainder with Porapak R 120-150 mesh (or equivalent)
- Carrier gas: nitrogen (flow rate: 80 ml/min)
- Detector: flame ionization
- Temperatures: injection port: 250º; column: 150º isothermal
Calculation: Quantify the ethanol and isopropanol present in the sample by comparing the peak areas with the corresponding peaks obtained by chromatographing the headspace produced by substituting in the procedure 1 ml of Standard alcohol solution for 1 ml of sample solution.
Microbiological criteria
Total plate count: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample into 99 ml of phosphate buffer and use a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve. Limit dissolving time to about 10 min and then pipette 1 ml of the solution into separate, duplicate, appropriately marked petri dishes. Pour over the aliquot of sample in each petri dish 12-15 ml of Plate Count Agar previously tempered to 44-46°. Mix well by alternate rotation and back and forth motion of the plates, allow the agar to solidify. Invert the plates and incubate for 48±2 h at 35±1°.
After incubation count the growing colonies visible on each plate and record the number of colonies. Take the average of both plates, and multiply by the sample dilution factor, 100. Where no colonies are visible, express the result as less than 100 CFU/g.
E. coli determination: The use of cellulase to degrade the gum sample prior to analysis is essential in order to avoid gelling of the gum during its addition to the enrichment broth. Prepare a 1.0% cellulase solution (1 g cellulase to 99 ml water) and sterilize by filtration through a 0.45 µm membrane. (Cellulase solution may be stored at 2-5° for up to two weeks.) Into a sterile tube containing 9 ml of sterile lauryl sulfate tryptose (LST) broth, aseptically add 0.1 ml of the sterile 1% cellulase solution. Add 1g gum sample to the tube and vortex vigorously to disperse the sample. Incubate the tube for 24-48 h at 35±1°. After 24 h, gently agitate the tube and examine for gas production, i.e., effervescence. Reincubate for an additional 24 hours if no gas evolution is observed. Examine a second time for gas. Perform the following confirmation test on the presumptive positive (gassing) result.
Gently agitate the gassing LST tube and transfer one loopful of the suspension to a tube containing 10 ml of EC broth and a fermentation (Durham) vial. Incubate the EC tube for 24-48 h at 45.5±0.2°. After 24 h, examine for gas production; if negative, examine again at 48 h. Streak a loopful of the suspension from the gassing tube onto L-EMB agar. It is essential that one portion of the plate exhibit well-separated colonies. Incubate 18-24 h at 35°. Examine the plates for colonies typical of E. coli, i.e., dark-centered with or without metallic sheen. Select two presumptively positive colonies and transfer them to PCA agar slants for morphological and biochemical tests. Incubate PCA slants for 18-24 h at 35±1°, then perform a Gram stain on the culture.
If the culture is Gram-negative (short rods) perform either of the following two biochemical test schemes:
Scheme 1.1 Tests for IMViC biochemical activity:
a. Indole production: Inoculate a tube of tryptone broth and incubate 24 h at 35°. Test for indole by adding 0.2-0.3 ml Kovacs' reagent. Appearance of a distinct red colour in the upper layer is a positive test.
b. Voges-Proskauer-reactive compounds: Inoculate a tube of MR-VP broth and incubate 48 h at 35°. Transfer 1 ml to a 13 x100 mm tube. Add 0.6 ml alpha-naphthol solution and 0.2 ml 40% KOH, and shake. Add a few crystals of creatine. Shake and let stand 2 h. Test is positive if eosin pink colour develops.
c. Methyl red-reactive compounds: Incubate the MR-VP tube from the Voges-Proskauer test an additional 48 h at 35°. Add 5 drops of methyl red solution to each tube. A distinct red colour is a positive test. A yellow colour is negative.
d. Use of citrate: Lightly inoculate a tube of Koser's citrate broth; avoid detectable turbidity. Incubate at 35° for 96 h. Development of distinct turbidity is positive reaction.
Scheme 1.2 Using the growth from the PCA slants, re-inoculate a tube of LST broth containing a Durham vial and incubate at 35° for 48 h to verify that the isolate has the ability to produce acid and gas from the fermentation of lactose.
Interpretation: Cultures that (a) produce gas as a result of the inoculation of LST broth and subsequent incubation for 24-48 h at 35°, (b) appear as Gram-negative non-spore-forming rods, and (c) give IMViC patterns ++-- (biotype 1) or -+-- (biotype 2), are considered to be E. coli.
Scheme 2. Disperse any colony growth into a small volume of 0.85% saline. Confirmation of the identity of the bacterial growth by chemical tests is conveniently done using API 20E or Micro ID strips or equivalent systems. After completion of the tests, identify the organism from the Identification Manual of the system used and record the final result.
Salmonella determination: The use of cellulase to degrade the gum sample prior to analysis is essential in order to avoid gelling of the gum during its addition to the enrichment medium. Prepare a 1.0% cellulase solution (1 g cellulase to 99 ml water) and sterilize by filtration through a 0.45 µm membrane. (The cellulase solution may be stored at 2-5° for up to two weeks.) Aseptically weigh 25 g of sample into a sterile beaker (250 ml) or other appropriate container. Into a sterile, wide mouth, screw-cap jar (500 ml) or other appropriate container, introduce 225 ml of sterile lactose broth and 2.25 ml sterile 1% cellulase solution. While vigorously stirring the cellulase/lactose broth with a magnetic stirrer, quickly transfer the 25 g sample through a sterile glass funnel into the cellulase/lactose broth. Cap jar securely and let stand 60 min at room temperature. Loosen the cap and incubate the container at 35±1° for 24±2 h.
Tighten lid and gently shake incubated sample mixture; transfer 1 ml mixture to 10 ml Selenite cystine (SC) broth and another 1 ml mixture to 10 ml Tetrathionate (TT) broth. Incubate 24±2 h at 35°. Mix (vortex, if tube) and streak a 3 mm loopful incubated TT broth on Bismuth sulfite (BS) agar, xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar, and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar. (Prepare BS plates the day before streaking and store in dark at room temperature until streaked.) Repeat with a 3 mm loopful of SC broth. Incubate plates 24±2 h at 35°.

Yeasts and moulds: Weigh 25 g of sample and add to 2475 ml of sterile 0.1% peptone water (prepared by adding 1 g of peptone to 1 liter of distilled water, mixing to dissolve peptone, and autoclaving at 121° for 15 min) while vigorously stirring with a magnetic stirrer. Stir until the sample is completely dissolved. This is a 1:100 dilution. Aseptically pipette 0.1 ml to each of 10 pre-poured, solidified CCPDA-D plates (see below). Spread inoculum evenly over the surface of the plates using a sterile, bent glass rod. Incubate plates in the upright position at 25° undisturbed for 5 days.
After incubation, count the growing colonies on each plate using a colony counter and record the total number of colonies present on the 10 plates. Separate the yeasts from the moulds according to their morphology and count them separately. Take the total number of colonies present in all 10 plates and multiply by 100 to obtain the CFU/g of sample. If none of the plates shows growth, express the result as less than 100 CFU/g.
CCPDA-D medium: First, prepare a 2% dichloran (2,6-dichloran-4-nitroaniline) stock solution in 95% ethanol. Then, to PDA, add a quantity of the dichloran stock solution sufficient to give a concentration of 2.5 mg/l. Add chloramphenicol to a concentration of 50 mg/l and autoclave at 121° for 15 min. Cool medium to about 50° and just before pouring the plates, add sufficient filter-sterilized chlortetracycline to give a concentration of 50 mg/l.

SYNONYMS
Gum arabic (Acacia senegal), gum arabic (Acacia seyal), Acacia gum, arabic gum, INS No. 414
DEFINITION
Gum arabic is a dried exudate obtained from the stems and branches of Acacia senegal (L.) Willdenow or Acacia seyal (fam. Leguminosae)
Gum arabic consists mainly of high-molecular weight polysaccharides and their calcium, magnesium and potassium salts, which on hydrolysis yield arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid. Items of commerce may contain extraneous materials such as sand and pieces of bark, which must be removed before use in food.
C.A.S. number
DESCRIPTION
Gum arabic (A. senegal) is a pale white to orange-brown solid, which breaks with a glassy fracture. The best grades are in the form of whole, spheroidal tears of varying size with a matt surface texture. When ground, the pieces are paler and have a glassy appearance.
Gum arabic (A. seyal) is more brittle than the hard tears of gum arabic (A. senegal).
Gum arabic is also available commercially in the form of white to yellowish-white flakes, granules, powder, roller dried, or spray-dried material.
An aqueous solution of 1 g in 2 ml flows readily and is acid to litmus.

Viscosity, 100°
Use a viscometer of the glass capillary type, calibrated and capable of measuring kinematic viscosity with a repeatability exceeding 0.35% only in one case in twenty. Immerse the viscometer in a liquid bath at the temperature required for the test ± 0.1° ensuring that at no time of the measurement will any portion of the sample in the viscometer be less than 20 mm below the surface of the bath liquid or less than 20 mm above the bottom of the bath. Charge the viscometer with sample in the manner dictated by the design of the instrument. Allow the sample to remain in the bath for about 30 min. Where the design of the viscometer requires it, adjust the volume of sample to the mark. Use pressure to adjust the head level of the sample to a position in the capillary arm of the instrument about 5 mm ahead of the first mark. With the sample flowing freely, measure, in seconds (±0.2 sec), the time required for the meniscus to pass from the first to the second timing mark. If the
time is less than 200 s, select a viscometer with a capillary of smaller diameter and repeat the operation. Make a second measurement of the flow time. If two measurements agree within 0.2%, use the average for calculating the kinematic viscosity. If the measurements do not agree, repeat the determination after thoroughly cleaning and drying the viscometer.
Viscosity, 100° (mm^2/sec) = C x t
where
C = calibration constant of the viscometer (mm^2/sec^2)
t = flow time (sec)
Readily carbonizable
substances
Place 5g of the sample in a glass-stoppered test tube that has previously been cleaned with a chromic acid cleaning solution, rinsed with water and dried in an oven (105°, 1h). Add 5 ml of sulfuric acid TS, and place in a boiling water bath. After the test tube has been in the bath for 30 sec, remove quickly, and while holding the stopper in place, give three vigorous vertical shakes over an amplitude of about 10 cm. Repeat every 30 sec. Do not keep the test tube out of the bath longer than 3 sec for each shaking period. At the end of 10 min from the time when first placed in the water bath, remove the test tube. The sample remains unchanged in colour, and the acid does not become darker than a very slight straw colour (Matching Fluid E , see FNP 5). No black material occurs at the interface between the two layers.

Column: Capillary column, 16 m x 0.53 mm
Column film: Nonpolar (polydimethyldisiloxane), thickness 0.1 µm, e.g. OV-1, DB 1
Column temperature:
- initial: 35°, 1 min
- 35° - 50°, 5°/min

- 170° - 310°, 10°/min
final: 310°, 45 min
Carrier
- gas: Helium
- flow: 10 ml/min
Injector pressure: 1.5 psi at 35°, constant flow
Detector: FID
Injection temperature: 35°
Sample size: 2 µl
Calibration:
Calibrate the instrument using a solution with known composition containing about 1.0 % of n-tetradecane, 1.0% of n-hexadecane and 1.0% of squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl tetracosane) in pentane. The differences between peak areas of the compounds should be less than 10.0% and the resolution between tetradecane and n-hexadecane should be between 2 and 5. Calculate the resolution (R) from the distance between n-tetradecane and n-hexadecane peaks at the peak maxima (d) and the width of the peaks at the baseline (Y): R = [2(d[1] - d[2])/(Y[1] - Y[2])].
Sample preparation:
Take a small amount of the sample into an automatic pipette. Place a drop of the sample in 1.00 ml of pentane, and mix well. Record the chromatogram for about 45 min.
Retention times:
The retention times for C[20], C[30], C[40], C[50] and C[60] are usually about 10.5, 16, 20, 23 and 26 min.
Calculation:
Calculate the level of hydrogenated decene dimer and the oligomer distribution by the method of area percentages (area normalization).
Calculate the percentage of hydrogenated poly-1-decene in the sample taken by the formula:
100 A/T
where
A = the sum of peak areas for C[30], C[40], C[50] and C[60]
T = the sum of all peak areas eluting in 45 min

Buffer solution A: In a 1000-ml volumetric flask dissolve 74.5 g of potassium chloride in 500 ml of water, add 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and dilute to volume with water.
Buffer solution B: Dissolve 171.0 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, K[2]HPO[4]^.
H[2]O, in 1000 ml of water, and add potassium dihydrogen phosphate, KH[2]PO[4], until the pH is exactly 7.0.
Maxima suppressor: Dissolve, with the aid of a magnetic stirrer, 1 g of gelatin in 65 ml of hot, boiled water. After cooling, add 35 ml of ethanol as a preservative.
Standard solution: Weigh out accurately about 20 g of the sample, 200 mg of fumaric acid and 10 mg of maleic acid, both of the highest purity available, and transfer into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Add 300 ml of sodium hydroxide TS, a few drops of phenolphthalein TS and continue adding sodium hydroxide TS to a faint pink colour that persists for at least 30 sec. Dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Sample solution: Transfer about 4 g of the sample, accurately weighed, to a 100-ml volumetric flask and dissolve in 25 ml of water. Add phenolphthalein TS, and neutralize with sodium hydroxide TS as directed for standard solution. Dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Procedure: Transfer two 25-ml portions of the "Sample solution" into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Dilute one flask (Sample A) to volume with "Buffer solution A". To the other flask (Sample B) add 50 ml of "Buffer solution B" and dilute to volume with water. Rinse a polarograph cell with a portion of "Sample A", add a suitable volume of the solution to the cell, immerse it in a water bath regulated at 24.5-25.5º, add 2 drops of the "Maxima suppressor", and then de-aereate by bubbling nitrogen through the solution for at least 5 min. Insert the dropping mercury electrode (negative polarity) of a suitable polarograph, adjust the current sensitivity as necessary, and record the polarogram from -0.1 to -0.8 volt at the rate of 0.2 volt per min, using a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. Transfer 25 ml of the "Standard solution" into a 100-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with "Buffer solution A". Obtain the polarogram of this solution (Standard
A) in the same manner as directed for "Sample A". In each polarogram, determine the height of the maleic acid plus fumaric acid wave occurring at the half-wave potential near -0.56 volt, recording that for sample as i[U] and that for the standard as i[S]. In the same manner, obtain polarograms from "Sample B" and a "Standard B", except record the polarogram from -1.05 to -1.7 volts at the rate of 0.1 volt per minute. In each polarogram, determine the height of the maleic acid wave occurring at the half-wave potential near -1.33 volts, recording that for the sample as i[U]' and that for the standard as i[S]'.
Calculation
Calculate the weight in mg, p, of combined maleic acid and fumaric acid in the sample taken by the formula:
500C x [i[U]/(i[S ]- i[U])]
where
C = the concentration, in mg per ml, of combined maleic acid and fumaric acid in the Standard solution.
Similarly, calculate the weight in mg, q, of maleic acid in the sample taken by the formula:
500C' x [ i[U]'/(i[S]' - i[U]')]
where
C'= the concentration, in mg per ml of maleic acid in the Standard solution.
Calculate the weight of fumaric acid in mg, r, in the sample taken from the difference in these values, i.e. (r = p - q).
Finally, calculate the percentage of fumaric and maleic acids present by multiplying r and q, respectively, by 0.025.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Dissolve about 2 g of the sample, accurately weighed, in 40 ml of recently boiled and cooled water, add 2 drops of phenolphthalein TS and titrate with 1 N sodium hydroxide to the first appearance of a faint pink colour which persists for at least 30 sec. Each ml of 1 N sodium hydroxide is equivalent to 67.04 mg of C[4]H[6]O[5].

Maltogenic amylase activity
The method is based on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze maltotriose to maltose and glucose. The reaction is stopped by raising the pH of the reaction medium to about 11. The formed glucose is converted to gluconolactone by glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD^+ , which is converted to NADH. The change in the concentration of NAD^+ is measured photometrically at 340 nm. One enzyme unit (Maltogenic Amylase Unit, MAU) is defined as the amount of enzyme, which, under standard assay conditions, cleaves 1 mmol of maltotriose per minute. Assay conditions being as follows: Substrate concentration 10 mg/ml; temperature 37º; pH 5.0; incubation time 30 min.
Preparation of 20 mg/ml-maltotriose substrate:
Dissolve 1000 mg maltotriose (e.g. Sigma M8378) in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0, making a total volume of 50 ml (to be prepared each day of analysis).
Preparation of glucose dehydrogenase (GluDH) reagent:
Add buffer solution (Merck No. 14051 or equivalent) to the enzyme mixture (Merck No. 14055, bottles "1" and "2", or equivalent). Allow the mixture to stand for 15 min. Transfer the solution to a 500-ml volumetric flask, containing 200 ml of 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0. Fill the flask to the mark with the same buffer. This solution can be stored for two weeks at room temperature (not in a refrigerator).
Preparation of standard enzyme solutions:
Dilute a maltogenic amylase standard with known activity in 10 mM NaCl to give the following enzyme units per ml: 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, 0.060 and 0.075.
Measurement of enzyme activity:
Add 500 ml of substrate solution (20 mg/ml maltotriose, prepared in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0, pre-warmed to 37º) to an equal volume of enzyme solution also pre-warmed to 37º. Mix the resulting solution thoroughly and transfer to a water bath maintained at 37º. After 30 min remove the test tube from the water bath, and add 1000 ml of the stop reagent (0.06N NaOH) and shake vigorously. Add 3 ml of GluDH reagent and mix again. Leave the test tube at room temperature for exactly 30 min and measure optical density (OD) at 340 nm. Prepare a blank in a similar manner except that the stop reagent is added before the substrate.
Calculation of enzyme activity:
Draw the enzyme standard curve in a coordinate system using enzyme activity (MAU/ml) as the abscissa and DOD (sample - blank) as the ordinate. Calculate the activity of the sample by reading DOD of sample dilutions on the standard curve and then multiplying by the corresponding dilution factors. The standard curve is a straight line passing through the origin and linear regression can therefore be applied.
Basic standardisation:
Glucose solutions:
a) Stock solution: Accurately weigh 1.60 g of glucose, analytical grade, in a 1000-ml volumetric flask and make up to volume with demineralised water.
b) standard solutions: Dilute 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 ml of stock solution to volume with deionised water in 100-ml volumetric flask to give standard solutions of 88.8, 178, 266, 355, 444 and 533 mmol/l.
Standard curve:
Prepare the glucose standard curve by mixing 2.0 ml glucose solution with 3.0 ml GluDH reagent and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. Read OD at 340 nm. Prepare a common blank using demineralised water instead of glucose solution. Plot glucose concentration (µmol/l) versus DOD.
Calculation:
Calculate the enzyme activity by reading the equivalent glucose concentration on the standard curve and inserting it in the following formula:
where:
A = reading on the standard curve, mmol/l
F = dilution factor of the enzyme solution, ml/g
4 = the ratio between amount of enzyme dilution in sample and amount of glucose solution in standard
30 = incubation time, 30 min

Oxygen in the sample gas produces variation in the electrical signal recorded at the outlet of the cell that is proportional to the oxygen content.
Calibrate the analyzer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Pass the gas through the analyser using a suitable pressure regulator and airtight metal tubes and operating at the prescribed flow-rates until constant readings are obtained.
Carbon monoxide
Pass 1050 ± 50 ml of the gas sample through a carbon monoxide detector tube at the rate specified for the tube. The indicator change corresponds to not more than 10 µl/l.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Determine by Gas chromatography using the following conditions:
Column:
- material: stainless steel
- length: 2 m
- internal diameter: 2 mm
- packing material: appropriate molecular sieve capable of absorbing molecules with diameters up to 0.5 nm.
Carrier:
- gas: helium (not less than 99.995 % (v/v) of He)
- flow: 40 ml/min
Detector: thermal conductivity detector
Injector: loop injector
Column temperature: 50°
Detector temperature: 130°
Reference gas (a): ambient air
Reference gas (b): Nitrogen (not less than 99.999 % (v/v) of N[2], less than 1 ppm CO, less than 5 ppm O[2])
Procedure: Inject reference gas (a). Adjust the injected volumes and operating conditions so that the height of the peak due to nitrogen in the chromatogram is at least 35 % of full scale of the recorder. The assay is not valid unless the chromatograms obtained show a clear separation of oxygen and nitrogen.
Inject the gas to be examined and the reference gas (b). In the chromatogram obtained with the gas to be examined, the area of the principal peak is at least 99.0 % of the area of the principal peak in the chromatogram obtained with reference gas (b).

Carefully open the container valve to produce a moderate flow of gas. Do not direct the gas stream toward the face, but deflect portion of the stream toward the nose: no appreciable odour is discernible.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Place a sufficient quantity of ammonium chloride-ammonium hydroxide solution, prepared by mixing equal volumes of water and ammonium hydroxide and saturating with ammonium chloride at room temperature, in test apparatus composed of a calibrated 100-ml burette, provided with two-way stopcock, a gas absorption pipette, and a levelling bulb, both of suitable capacity and all suitably interconnected. Fill the gas absorption pipette with metallic copper in the form of wire coils, wire mesh, or other suitable configuration. Eliminate all gas bubbles from the liquid in the test apparatus. Activate the test solution by performing two to three tests that are not for record purposes.
Fill the calibrated burette, all interconnecting tubing, both stopcock opening, and the intake tube with liquid. Draw 100.0 ml of oxygen into the burette by lowering the levelling bulb. Open the stopcock to the absorption pipette, and force the oxygen into the absorption pipette by raising the levelling bulb. Agitate the pipette to provide frequent and intimate contact of the liquid, gas, and copper. Continue agitation until no further diminution in volume occurs. Draw the residual gas back into calibrated burette, and measure its volume: not more than 1.0 ml of gas remains.

Weigh 600 mg of the sample to the nearest 0.1 mg and dissolve in sufficient water to make 100 ml. Transfer 10.0 ml of the solution into a 50-ml glass-stoppered flask. Pipette 20 ml of N hydrochloric acid into the flask, weigh the flask, and reflux for 3 h, taking precautions to prevent loss of vapours. Cool to room temperature, and add water to make up for any weight loss during refluxing. Pipette 1.0 ml of a 1 in 200 solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 N hydrochloric acid into a 30-ml separatory funnel, then add 2.0 ml of the sample solution, mix, and allow to stand at room temperature for 5 min. Extract the mixture with 5 ml of ethyl acetate, and discard the aqueous layer. Extract the hydrazone from the ethyl acetate with three 5-ml portions of sodium carbonate TS, collecting the extracts in a 50-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with sodium carbonate TS and mix.
Standard preparation
Weigh 45 mg of pyruvic acid, to the nearest 0.1 mg, and transfer into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water, and mix. Transfer 10.0 ml of this solution into a 50-ml glass-stoppered flask, and continue as directed under "Sample preparation", beginning with "Pipette 20 ml of N hydrochloric acid into the flask".
Procedure
Determine the absorbance of each solution with a suitable spectrophotometer in 1-cm cells at the maximum of about 375 nm, using sodium carbonate TS as the blank. The absorbance of the "Sample preparation" is equal to or greater than that of the "Standard preparation".
Ethanol and isopropanol
Principle
The alcohols are converted to the corresponding nitrite esters and determined by headspace gas chromatography (FNP 5).
Sample preparation
Dissolve 100 mg of sample in 10 ml of water using sodium chloride as a dispersing agent if necessary.
Internal standard solution
Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l of n-propanol.
Standard alcohol solution
Prepare an aqueous solution containing 50 mg/l each of ethanol and isopropanol.
Procedure
Weigh 200 mg of urea into a 25-ml "dark vial" (Reacti-flasks, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, or equivalent). Purge with nitrogen for 5 min and then add 1 ml of saturated oxalic acid solution, close with a rubber stopper and swirl. Add 1 ml of sample solution, 1 ml of internal standard solution, and simultaneously start a stopwatch (T=0). Swirl the vial and recap with an open screw cap fitted with a silicone rubber septum. Swirl until T=30 sec. At T=45 sec inject through the septum 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (250 g/l). Swirl until T=70 sec and at T=150 sec withdraw through the septum 1 ml of the headspace using a pressure lock syringe (Precision Sampling Corp., Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA), or equivalent.
Gas chromatography
Insert syringe needle in the injection port; precompress the sample, then open the syringe and inject the sample.
Use the following conditions:
- Column: glass (4mm i.d., 90 cm)
- Packing: first 15 cm packed with chrompack (or equivalent) and the remainder with Porapak R 120-150 mesh (or equivalent)
- Carrier gas: nitrogen (flow rate: 80 ml/min)
- Detector: flame ionization
- Temperatures: injection port: 250º; column: 150º isothermal
Calculation
Quantify the ethanol and isopropanol present in the sample by comparing the peak areas with the corresponding peaks obtained by chromatographing the headspace produced by substituting in the procedure 1 ml of Standard alcohol solution for 1 ml of Sample solution.
Microbiological criteria
Total plate count: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample into 99 ml of phosphate buffer and use a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve. Limit dissolving time to about 10 min and then pipette 1 ml of the solution into separate, duplicate, appropriately marked petri dishes. Pour over the aliquot of sample in each petri dish 12-15 ml of Plate Count Agar previously tempered to 44-46°. Mix well by alternate rotation and back and forth motion of the plates, allow the agar to solidify. Invert the plates and incubate for 48±2 h at 35±1°.
After incubation count the growing colonies visible on each plate and record the number of colonies. Take the average of both plates, and multiply by the sample dilution factor, 100. Where no colonies are visible, express the result as less than 100 cfu/g.
E. coli determination: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample in 99 ml of Lactose broth using either a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve the sample. Limit the dissolving time to about 15 min and then lightly seal the container and incubate the broth for 18-24 h at 35±1°. Using a sterile pipette, inoculate 1 ml of the incubate into a tube containing 10 ml GN broth. Incubate for 18-24 h and then streak any GN broths showing positive growth or gas production onto duplicate plates of Levine EMB agar. Incubate the plates for 24±2 h at 35±1° and then examine for colonies typical of E. coli i.e. showing strong purple growth with dark centre and a green metallic sheen sometimes spreading onto the agar. Record any typical E. coli colonies as presumptive positive, otherwise negative.
Streak any well isolated suspect colonies onto a plate of PCA and incubate for 18-24 h at 35±1°. Perform a Gram stain on any growth to confirm it is Gram negative. If so, disperse any colony growth into a small volume of 0.85% saline and perform chemical tests to confirm the identity of the bacterial growth. This can most conveniently be done by using API 20E or Micro ID strips or equivalent systems.
After completion of the tests, identify the organism from the Identification manual of the system used and record the final result.

Yeasts and moulds: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample into 99 ml of phosphate buffer and use a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve. Limit dissolving time to about 10 min and then pipette 1 ml of the solution into separate, duplicate, appropriately marked petri dishes. Pour over the aliquot of sample in each petri dish 15-20 ml of Potato dextrose agar (either acidified or containing antibiotic) previously tempered to 44-46°. Mix well by alternate rotation and back and forth motion of the plates, and allow the agar to solidify. Invert the plates and incubate for 5 days at 20-25°.
After incubation, count the growing colonies visible on each plate using a colony counter and record the number of colonies. Separate the yeasts from the moulds according to their morphology and count them separately. Take the average of both plates and multiply by the sample dilution factor, 100. Where no colonies are visible, express the result as less than 100 cfu/g.

ORGANIZATION OF THE SECTION FOR SPECIFICATIONS OF FLAVOURING AGENTS
At its 44th meeting JECFA considered a new approach to the safety evaluation of flavouring agents. This approach incorporates a series of criteria whose use enables the evaluation of a large number of these agents in a consistent and timely manner. At the current session of the Committee specifications of identity and purity were prepared for 187 flavouring agents. These specifications are documented on the following pages.
The specifications are presented in a tabular formal because with the number of flavouring agents now being evaluated, the method of presentation becomes a matter of efficiency. Some of the substances have uses additional to that of being a flavouring agent, for example also serving as a carrier solvent. For these substances the specifications are presented both in the traditional format in Section A and in the tabular format in Section B. Section B, in some cases, contains a reference back to Section A so as to avoid repeating some tests which apply to all uses.
Information on specifications is given under the following headings, most of which are self-explanatory: Name; Chemical name; Synonyms; Flavour and Extract Manufacturer's Association of the United States (FEMA) No; Council of Europe (COE) No; Chemical Abstract Service Registry (CAS) No; Molecular weight; Chemical formula; Physical form/odour; Solubility; Solubility in ethanol*, Boiling point (information only); Identification test (ID), IR infrared spectrum; Assay min%**; Acid value max'; Refractive index (at 20º, if not otherwise stated)*; Specific gravity (at 25º, if not otherwise stated)*; Other requirements, e.g. additional tests*; and last column indicates the JECFA Session at which the specifications were prepared. A means "also used as an acidity regulator, E means " also used as extraction solvent, C means "also used as carrier solvent", P means " also used as preservative", (See Section A, above). R means "specifications revised", S means "existing specifications
maintained, S,T means "existing tentative specifications maintained", (further information ), N means "new specifications", and N,T means "new tentative specifications, ( further information required).
Flavouring agents listed as "Tentative" at the 53^rd meeting of JECFA, are given in the next Section (Section C).
NOTE: Many of the spectra are of unsatisfactory editorial quality. The FAO JECFA Secretariat is exploring ways and means to produce satisfactory and consistent spectra when these specifications are printed again. As it is important in preparing spectra to know the operating conditions to be used; organizations may wish to request details appropriate to an individual flavouring agent from FEMA:

GAS CHROMATOGRAPHIC (GC) ASSAY OF FLAVOUR CHEMICALS
This procedure applies both to the assay of flavour chemicals and to the quantitation of minor components in flavour chemicals. Analysts following this procedure and performing the test, should obtain sufficient resolution of major and even trace components of a mixture to calculate accurately the concentration of the desired component. They should be familiar with the general principles, usual techniques, and instrumental variables normally met in gas chromatographic analysis. They should pay particular attention to the following:
1. Stability of baseline, return to baseline before and after each peak of interest, and minimum use of recorder attenuation.
2. Any incompatibility between a sensitive sample component and column support, liquid substrate, or construction material.
3. The response to different components of the same or different detectors. Since sizeable errors may be encountered in correlating area percent directly to weight percent, the methods for calculating response factors should be known.
4. Where limits for minor components are specified in the column entitled Other Requirements in the above tabular specifications for flavour chemicals, analysts should use authentic materials to confirm the retention times of minor components. Determine the quantity of components following the instructions below under Calculations and Methods.
GC CONDITIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Column: open tubular capillary column of fused silica or deactivated glass 30 m long x 0.25 to 0.53 mm id
Stationary phase:
1. For a non-polar column: methyl silicone gum, or equivalent (preferably a bonded and cross-linked dimethyl polysiloxane)
2. For a polar column: polyethylene glycol, or equivalent (preferably a bonded and cross-linked polyethylene glycol)
3. The stationary phase coating should have a thickness of 1 to 3 µm
Carrier gas: helium flowing at a linear velocity of 20 to 40 ml/s
Sample size: 0. 1 to 1.0 µl
Split ratio: (for 0.25 mm to 0.35 mm id columns only) 50:1 to 200:1, typically. Make sure that no individual component exceeds the capacity of the column
Inlet temperature: 225 to 275º
Detector temperature: 250 to 300º
Detectors: use either a thermal conductivity or flame ionization detector operating both as recommended by the manufacturer
Oven program: 50 to 240º, increasing the temperature by 5º/min, hold at 240º for 5 min
Analysts can also use any GC conditions providing separations equal to (or better than) those obtained with the above method, but in the case of a dispute, the above method must stand.
CALCULATIONS AND METHODS
A. Peak area integration with total area detected normalized to 100%, using electronic integrators: Use an electronic peak integrator in accordance with the manufacture's recommendations. Ensure that the integration parameters permit proper integration of the peaks of a variety of shapes and magnitudes and do not interpret baseline shifts and noise spikes as area contributed by the sample. Use internal or external standards as needed to confirm that the total GC peak area corresponds to 100% of the components present in the sample.
B. Results obtained as described above are based on the assumption that the entire sample has eluted and the peaks of all of the components have been included in the calculation. They will be incorrect if any part of the sample does not elute or if all the peaks are not measured. In such cases, and in all methods described above, the internal standard method may be used to determine percentages based on the total sample. For this method, measurements are required of the peaks of the component(s) being assayed and of the internal standard.
An accurately weighed mixture of the internal standard and the sample is prepared and chromatographed, the area ratio(s) of the component(s) to the standard is computed, and the percentage(s) of the component(s) is calculated.
If this calculation is to be applied, the substance used as the standard should be one that meets the following criteria:
a. Its detector response is similar to that of the component(s) to be determined. In general, the more nearly the chemical structure of the component resembles that of the standard, the closer the response will be.
b. Its retention time is close to, but not identical with, that of the component(s).
c. Its elution time is different from that of any other component in the sample so that its peak does not superimpose on any other.
The weight ratio of the internal standard to the sample should be such that the internal standard and the component sought produce approximately equal peaks. This is not possible, of course, if several components of interest are at different levels of concentration.
If the internal standard method is applied properly, it may be assumed that the ratio of the weight of component to the weight of internal standard is exactly proportional to the peak area ratio, and under these conditions no correction factor is needed. The sample is first run by itself to determine whether the internal standard would mask any component by peak superimposition. If there is no interference, a mixture is prepared of the sample and of the internal standard in the specified weight ratio, and the percentages of the internal standard and of the sample in the mixture are calculated. The mixture is chromatographed, and the areas of the component peak and the internal standard peak are calculated by one of the methods described above.
The calculations are as follows:
1.1. % Component in Mixture/ %Internal Standard in Mixture = Component Area/Internal Standard Area, or
1.2. % Component in Mixture = % Internal Standard in Mixture x (Component Area/ Internal Standard Area)
2. % Component in Sample = (%Component in Mixture x 100) / %Sample in Mixture
Should calibration be necessary, mixtures should be prepared of internal standard and component, of either 100% or of known purity. The number of mixtures and the weight ratios to be used depend on the component being analyzed. Usually, three mixtures will be required. The weight ratio of one is chosen so that the heights of component and standard are equal. The ratios of the other two may be two-thirds and four-thirds of their value. Each mixture should be chromatographed at least three times, and areas calculated. The factor for each chromatograph should be calculated as specified below, and the averages taken for each mixture. An overall average factor is calculated from them. The calibration should be performed periodically.
1. Factor = [(Weight of Component x % Purity) / (Weight of Internal Standard x % Purity)] x [(Internal Standard Area) / Component Area]
2. % Component in Sample Mixture = (Component Area x Factor x % Internal Standard in Sample Mixture) / Internal Standard Area
3. % Component in Sample = (% Component in Sample Mixture x 100) / Sample in Sample Mixture
GC SYSTEM SUITABILITY TEST SAMPLE
The GC system suitability test sample consists of an equal-weight mixture of food-quality acetophenone, benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, linalool, and hydroxycitronellal.
Using the test sample described below, periodically test the performance of and resolution provided by the gas chromatograph employed. The test sample must display results comparable in quantitative composition, peak shape, and elution order to those specified below. The quantitative composition should not deviate from the results listed below by more than 10%. Analyze the GC test sample using the GC Conditions for Analysis given above.

Section C. Principles governing the establishment and revision of specifications
Residual ethanol
Extraction solvents are used in the production of various food additives, and among these solvents is ethanol. Where solvents are employed, the specifications for those additives usually include limits for the residues of such solvents. The Committee was requested to consider whether a requirement for a limit for residual ethanol should also be included in such cases. It concluded that from the point of view of good manufacturing practice, ethanol should not be considered differently from other extraction solvents, and it reaffirmed the requirement for residue limits to be specified for all such solvents, including ethanol. The Committee noted, for instance, that the existing specifications for cochineal extract and xanthan gum indicate that ethanol is used as a solvent in their production, but that their specifications do not contain criteria for residual ethanol. An ethanol limit was included in the specification for xanthan gum which was revised at the present meeting.
Heavy metals (as lead) limit test
The Committee agreed to implement the decisions taken at its forty-ninth and fifty-first meetings to review and replace the heavy metals limit test with limits for individual metals of concern in all existing specifications as appropriate. In order to accomplish this, the Committee decided to review systematically the existing specifications on the basis of functional use (e.g. antioxidants, preservatives) and set a target of five years for completion of the task.
The call for data for future meetings will include requests for suggested limits for individual heavy metals in a group of additives together with supporting data. Once the Committee has considered the submissions, proposals will be submitted for consideration by the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants for adoption by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
The Committee reaffirmed its earlier conclusions that it would usually set a maximum level of 2 mg/kg for lead and 1 mg/kg for cadmium and for mercury, except when there were good reasons for setting a lower or higher maximum level. The Committee also reaffirmed its earlier decision to include limits for arsenic only when the source from which the additive is prepared, or the nature of the manufacturing method, indicated that such a limit was necessary.
The Committee reaffirmed the point made at earlier meetings that, when the heavy metals limit test is replaced by specific limits, the intention is not to weaken the specifications but to ensure that limits are placed on the levels of those elements that are likely to be of potential concern.
Citation of microbial strains
At its fifty-first meeting, the Committee revised an addendum to the general specifications for enzyme preparations used in food processing which addressed preparations from a genetically modified organism, originally published in FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 52 as Appendix B to Annex 1, and published in Addendum 6. At the present meeting, the Committee further reviewed the specifications for numbering microbial strains in the light of comments received by the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants at its thirty-first meeting.
The Committee reaffirmed that the requirement for identification of a strain number in the source section of monographs on enzymes prepared from genetically modified organisms might impose unnecessary constraints on the development of production organisms for food-grade enzymes. The Committee concluded that the source section of the monograph on an enzyme derived from a non-pathogenic, non-toxicogenic strain that belongs to a species that includes pathogenic and toxicogenic strains should include the statement that 'the strain is non-pathogenic and non-toxicogenic', and citation of a suitable strain number could be included by way of example.
The Committee, therefore, amended the requirement for microbial strain numbers in the specifications section of Appendix B to Annex 1 as follows (new text in quotes):
Microbial strain numbers - Any microbial strain that meets the considerations described above should be a safe and suitable host for the introduced DNA. Citation in the monograph of the genus and species of the host organism is usually adequate for those that have been determined to be safe and suitable. Identification at the strain level may impose unnecessary constraints on the development of production micro-organisms used to produce food-grade enzymes. "In the case of a non-pathogenic, non-toxicogenic strain that belongs to a species that includes pathogenic and toxicogenic strains (e.g. Escherichia coli), there should be a requirement in the monograph that the strain be non-pathogenic and non-toxicogenic. Citation of a suitable strain number may be included by way of example."
The Committee further decided that lack of pathogenicity and toxicogenicity was a general requirement that should apply to all micro-organisms used to produce food-grade enzymes. It also agreed to the addition of the following text to the end of the section on source materials of the General specifications for enzyme preparations used in food processing published as Annex 1 to FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 52.
" When a non-pathogenic, non-toxicogenic strain belongs to a species that includes pathogenic and toxicogenic strains, the source section of the monograph for the enzyme should include a requirement that the strain be non-pathogenic and non-toxicogenic. Citation of a suitable strain number may be included by way of example."
The Committee further agreed that the source section of any monograph for a food additive that has been prepared from a micro-organism that belongs to a species that includes pathogenic and toxicogenic strains should include a requirement that the strain be non-pathogenic and non-toxicogenic. Citation of a suitable strain number may be included by way of example.
Tentative specifications for food additives
The Committee noted that many of the specifications for food additives (other than flavouring agents) published in the FAO Compendium of Food Additives Specifications and its addenda are designated as 'tentative', indicating that some information or data were missing or incomplete at the time the specifications were prepared. Some of these specifications have been designated 'tentative' for more than 30 years and often do not indicate why the designation was given. Newer specifications include the reasons for the designation.
The Committee prepared two lists that encompass all of the existing tentative specifications except those for flavouring agents. List 1 comprises older tentative specifications that do not include reasons for the tentative designation. List 2 contains the remaining tentative specifications, for which reasons are given for the designation.
Information on the present uses and the technical data on the additives in the list, will be requested if no data are received. If the substance is no longer used in foods, the tentative specifications will be withdrawn. Information will also be requested on the listed reasons for those substances in List 2 so the Committee can review the available information and data submitted to decide if the tentative specifications should be withdrawn.
Specifications for flavouring agents designated as 'tentative'
Between 1996 and 1998, the Committee developed specifications for the purity of 449 flavouring agents, of which 111 were designated as 'tentative' because certain necessary information was lacking. In making these designations, the Committee relied on its judgement rather than on a carefully defined system. The present Committee agreed that it was important to be consistent in applying tentative designations and agreed that specifications submitted for consideration at the present meeting should be designated as tentative if information had not been provided on:
* chemical formula and relative molecular mass
* identity test and
* minimum assay value
and on the additional purity-related criteria:
* boiling-point (for liquids)
* melting-point (for solids)
* refractive index (for liquids) and
* specific gravity (for liquids).
The Committee will, however, consider full specifications when the absence of one or more of the last four purity-related criteria can be justified.
Using this approach, the Committee designated 110 of the 187 specifications submitted for consideration at the present meeting, as tentative. In order to ensure consistency, the Committee agreed that the specifications for the 449 flavouring agents evaluated at the forty-sixth, forty-ninth, and fifty-first meetings should be re-examined by the same approach. As a result, the tentative designation for one of the specifications (No. 8, allyl sorbate) was removed, and 54 other specifications were given a tentative designation. Although some of the flavouring agents are well-characterised substances, e.g. acetaldehyde and acetic acid, they are included because not all of the information required to satisfy the criteria set out above regarding their use as flavouring agents was included in the material submitted.
Overall, 164 out of the 449 specifications set at the previous three meetings are now designated as tentative, making a total of 277 designated as tentative out of the 636 specifications for substances considered between 1996 and the present meeting. The Committee agreed that flavouring agents submitted for evaluation at future meetings would not be considered for specifications unless the minimum information set out above was provided.
The Committee concluded that its first priority is to seek further information on these tentative specifications; however, it also intends to re-examine the specifications that may not be designated as tentative but for which the minimum assay values are less than 95%, and data will be called for review at its fifty-fifth meeting in 2000. If these data are not supplied, the specifications will be withdrawn.

Section D. Test for gluconate
Dissolve a quantity of the sample in water to obtain a solution containing 10 mg/ml, heating in a water bath at 60º, if necessary. Similarly, prepare a standard solution of potassium gluconate in water containing 10 mg/ml.
Apply separate 5-µl portions of the test solution and the standard solution on a suitable thin-layer chromatographic plate coated with 0.25-mm layer of chromatographic silica gel, and allow to dry. Develop the chromatogram in a solvent system consisting of a mixture of ethanol, water, ammonium hydroxide, and ethyl acetate (50:30:10:10) unti1 the solvent front has moved about three-fourths of the length of the plate. Remove the plate from the chamber, and dry at 110º for 20 min. Allow to cool, and spray with a reagent, prepared as follows: Dissolve 2.5 g of ammonium molybdate in about 50 ml of 2 N sulfuric acid in a 100-MI volumetric flask, add 1.0 g of ceric sulfate, swirl to dissolve, dilute with 2 N sulfuric acid to volume, and mix. Heat the plate at 100º for about 10min. The principal spot obtained from the test solution corresponds in colour, size, and retention to that obtained from the standard solution.
Note: This test will be included in General Methods (Guide to JECFA Specifications), FNP 5/Rev 3.

Compendium of food additive specifications Addendum 7 Food and Nutrition Paper 52 Add.7
This document is one of the three publications prepared by the fifty-third session of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Rome, Italy, in June 1999, and dedicated to the evaluation of food additives and contaminants in food.
The report of the meeting will be published in the WHO Technical Report Series and the toxicological monographs as No. 44 in the WHO Food Additives Series. Specifications of certain food additives in this document provides information on their identity and purity. The three main objectives of these specifications are to identify the substance that has been subject to biological testing, to ensure that the substance is of the quality required for safe use in food and to reflect and encourage good manufacturing practice (GMP). This publication will be useful to all who work with or are interested in food additives and their safe use in food.

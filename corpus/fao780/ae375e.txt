Agribusiness Handbooks.
Sunflower / Crude and Refined Oils.
This publication was prepared by the FAO Investment Centre under the FAO/EBRD cooperation agreement to provide quick technical and economical reference material to EBRD's agribusiness team in sub-sectors where they often work. Focus was given to the Bank's countries of operation in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with indicators of technical and economical performance in other regions of the world noted for comparison. The series of handbooks contained in this publication cover specific agribusiness sub-sectors, with information on production and processing techniques, costs and margins, world production, prices and trade trends. Data were collected from a number of official and unofficial sources as indicative information that should be interpreted with caution, and do not imply the expression of any opinion by FAO concerning the economic situation of countries mentioned.

FAO / EBRD Agribusiness Handbooks vol.2 - Sunflower / Crude and Refined Oils.
1- SUNFLOWER CULTIVATION.
Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is a composite annual plant. It probably originated in the south-west United Sates-Mexico area. It was introduced into Europe in the 16th century and became established as an oil-seed crop in Eastern Europe. The discovery of cytoplasmic male sterility in 1968 made possible the efficient production of hybrid sunflowers with high oil content. Biotechnological advances also increase productivity significantly.
Key production parameters.
· · Mainly produced in warm temperate regions, Frost will damage sunflower at all stages of growth. The plant grows well within a temperature range of 20-25°C; temperatures above 25°C reduce yields and oil content of the seeds. It is drought resistant, but yield and oil content are reduced if plants are exposed to drought stress during the main growing and flowering periods. Sunflower will produce moderate crops with as little as 300 mm of rain, while 500-750 mm are required for better yields It adapts to a wide variety of soils, but performs best on good land with high levels of management inputs. Good maize or wheat land is ideal. The average fatty acid composition of oil from temperate sunflower crops is 55-75% linoleic acid and 15-25% oleic acid. Protein content is 15-20%. Planting in the Eastern Europe and FSU takes place during March and April. Sunflower has one of the shortest growing seasons of the major cash crops of the world. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting 90 to 120 days after planting and late maturing varieties 120 to 160 days. Delayed harvesting causes unwelcome changes in oil quality with an increase in free fatty acid content. The seeds are ready to harvest when the heads turn black or brown and the seed moisture content reaches 10-12%. Grain combines are fairly easily adapted for the harvesting of sunflowers by the addition of a head snatcher. The average global yield is1210 kg/ha. However, depending on climatic and cultivation conditions, specific yields can vary as much as between 600 and 3,000 kg/ha; irrigation under certain conditions contributes substantially to increased output.

Key production costs.
For an average yield of 2.8 ton/ha obtained in Romania in good cropping condition with availability of all necessary good quality inputs, the variable costs per ha are roughly as follows:.
Seeds US$ 30 Fertilisers US$ 70 Sparys US$ 55 Fuel US$ 35 Machinery US$ 190 Land Rent US$ 100 Salaries US$ 30 Others US$ 10 TOTAL US$ 520.
On the top of those costs must be added operative costs for machinery and its depreciation. Drying cost are rather high, approximately US$ 80 / ha or US$ 50 / ton seeds.

Average margins for producers.
Average margins for producers highly depend on the level of subsidies for sunflower cropping. In the UK for example, the subsidies amount up to US$ 460 / ha. At a seed sale's price of US$ 290 per ton and a yield of 1.7 ton / ha, the general output is (290 x 1.7) + 460, i.e. US$ 950. Gross margin for production of dried ready to store sunflower seeds is 950 - (520+80) = US$ 350 / ha.

2- SUNFLOWER SEEDS PROCESSING: CRUDE & REFINED OILS.
Process description.
a) Drying and storage · · Seeds dry easily and once dried (i.e. with less than 9% moisture content) store well. Storage time increases with seed dryness. It is liable to damage by insects and other storage pests. On-farm storage must take these factors into account, otherwise losses can be extremely high. Drying temperatures of 50-70°C are suitable and do not affect the oil content. Because of its light weight, sunflower seed requires more storage volume than heavier crops. For the same reason, transportation equipment must be voluminous enough, in order to achieve economic transport in bulk. (A truck holding 24 tons of wheat, for example, will hold only 14 tons of sunflower seeds.).
b) Crude oil extraction · Cleaning and drying in large dryers/coolers, which reduce moisture content to about 9% and cooling.
Shelling and separation of shells in a series of crackers and bed screens, leaving about 8-12% shells in the kernels and a maximum of 1.5% kernels in the shells. Shells are generally compacted and used as fuel for boilers. Secondary drying, after which the kernels are flaked in order to break the seed cells and increase the oil extraction yield. Crude oil can be obtained through pressing only (mechanical), or by solvent (hexane) extraction. In the practise, the combination of those two methods exits, but tends to disappear. Pressing is effected in an expeller or a large screw press, which extracts up to 80% of the oil, while through solvent, extraction reaches up to 99%. Pressing, as well as solvent extraction, can be practised either on decorticated or non decorticated seeds. The meal which is the by-product of the extraction process, is constituted of the defatted matter and is fairly rich in protein: 30 to 40 %. In the case of a solvent extraction, it contains less than 1% residuaI oil, while it is much fatter when resulting from pressing. The meals are used in animal feed to balance the proteïn content. To this purpose, they are generally pelletised and named sunpellets.
c) Refining · Sunflower seed oil obtained by solvent extraction is easy to refine; the basic refining steps are: degumming, neutralising, drying, bleaching, deodorising and dewaxing. Oil obtained only through pressing just needs dewaxing. Degumming is effected by the addition of hot water and centrifugation. Sunflower oil is commonly neutralised by addition and mixing of caustic soda under controlled conditions, which neutralises the free fatty acids. Bleaching (colour removal and purification of the oil) is usually achieved with neutral clay or bentonite (acid-activated earth), while deodorisation consists of a steam-stripping of the oil at high temperature and under high vacuum. Dewaxing is made by a winterisation process which cools the oil to crystallise the wax and removes the wax crystals by filtration. If not dewaxed, the oil may appear cloudy and wax may settle out. For consumer-grade cooking and the manufacture of food products oil must be fully refined and winterised.

Key processing costs.
The following economic considerations are for illustrative purpose only (European standard plant). · A 1000t/day sunflower oil extraction plant costs approximately US$ 50 million; it represents a relatively high capital investment because highly explosive hexane vapours, always present in the process area, require that all electrical equipment be of explosionproof design. Key factors that will affect profitability of the operation are: price of sunflower seeds and cost of fuel.
The average toll fee for crushing non decorticated seeds in the E.U. is about 30 US$/ton, of which 7 US$ are for variable costs (salaries, depreciation, operation & maintenance).

· A 50 t/day sunflower oil refinery costs approximately 20 cents/kg of product (annual capacity); it also represents a relatively high capital investment, because most of the equipment is of sanitary, stainless steel construction, and requires a building designed to meet high standards of hygiene. It also requires trained operators and good quality control to ensure a product of acceptable flavour, stability, odour and colour. For example, the average toll fee for fully refined and winterised sunflower crude oil in EU ranges between 80 and 100 US$/ton (refined oil).

As an example, sunflower seed oil exported from the USA is traded under the American Fats and Oils Association Rule No. 14, which provides that: "Crude Sunflower seed oil shall be pure and produced only from sunflower seed of fair and average quality by mechanic or solvent extraction processes. The buyer shall receive an allowance of 0.1 per cent of the invoice value for each 0.1 per cent of free fatty acid in excess of 2 per cent; fraction in proportion".

Sunflower seed meal values are mainly classified by their protein content. The Grain and Free Trade Association (GATFA) Trading Rule No. 100 is the rule most frequently applied in the world trade in sunflower seed meal; it specifies a minimum protein-plus-fat content, with the specific level of protein/fat designated at the time of sale. Other characteristics are negotiated on an individual contract basis.
Average margins for processors.
It is not very meaningful to calculate average margins for processors, since margins vary a lot from case to case. For the purpose of that calculation, the following price data should be collected: · · · · seed delivered to the factory the crude oil ex tank factory the meal ex factory the refined oil.
Once these data are collected, one should apply the following yields: · · · 42.5% of crude oil in the seeds 56% of meal in seed loss of 5% of crude oil for refining.
World production & main processors.
More than 90% of sunflower seeds produced are processed into edible oil. Nevertheless, one type of edible sunflower seed is used directly for confectionery purposes. This seed is usually black with white stripes and is larger than the seed cultivated for oil extraction; the hull is heavier and less firmly attached to the kernel, and its oil content rarely exceeds 35%. In Eastern European countries as well as in FSU, edible seeds are used in the manufacture of a large number of food products, including desserts, cereals, ice creams, salad toppings and snacks. Part of the production of confectionery sunflower seeds (25% in the USA) is used as birdfeed.

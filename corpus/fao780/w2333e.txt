<title>LIST OF ANIMAL SPECIES USED IN AQUACULTURE</title>
<section>1</section>
1. INTRODUCTION
The number of animal species suitable for aquaculture is steadily increasing worldwide. As new techniques for artificial breeding, rearing and feeding are developed, many species previously only available through capture fisheries are now under culture or experimentation. Notwithstanding this effort of researchers and farmers, most of the world aquaculture production is based on a relatively limited number of species.
According to the latest official aquaculture production statistics (FAO, 1996), production data for 103 fish species, 21 crustacean species and 43 mollusc species were reported for 1994. These 167 species accounted for 15,369,861 metric tons of production, or 82.8% of the total aquaculture production (18,555,115 mt) reported to FAO for the three major animal groups. The other 3,185,254 mt of production (17.1% of the total) were not identified to species and were reported by member countries to FAO using genus, family or less specific taxonomic levels. Other animal resources, such as frogs, turtles, crocodiles and alligators, sea-squirts and tunicates, and sponges, have not been included in this list because production data at the species level have been reported to FAO (1996) only for one species (Chelonia mydas). Species cultivated only for larval feeding, such as Artemia salina, have not been included.
Other species, selected from recent literature (consulted through ASFA, 1996) and literature reviews (see References) or from previous lists (Pillay, 1990), have been added to those reported in FAO (1996), resulting in a total number of 262 species including 151 fish species, 39 crustacean species and 72 mollusc species. Although Pullin (1996) puts the number of fish species used in aquaculture slightly higher at 178, only species cultured commercially and with a relevant production in some country have been considered here, thus excluding species under experimentation and those animal produced by inter-species hybridization.
The purposes of this preliminary list of aquaculture species are: i) to document, to the extent possible, the number of animal species currently cultured by region and worldwide; ii) to facilitate communication of accurate information on species names and production, and iii) to assess contribution of introduced species to aquaculture production.
Since this list is provisional it is hoped that this Circular will provoke comments and suggestions from researchers and farmers alike. Persons finding mistakes or omissions are kindly requested to send comments to:

2. STRUCTURE OF THE LIST
The information provided for each species includes: family, scientific name, common name, environment, total production as reported by FAO (1996), geographical distribution and production by continent. The species are listed, inside each group, by the phylogenetic order of the families (Eschmeyer,1990, for fish classification; Bowman and Abele, 1982, for crustacean classification; Turgeon et al., 1988, for mollusc classification) and in alphabetical order inside each family.
In some cases, the scientific names listed with production data in FAO (1996) have been amended to conform to recent taxonomic revisions. Difficulties in species classification and lack of specificity in the data supplied by Members Countries are limitations in the quality of aquaculture statistics and need improvement (FAO, 1995b). Scientific names, common names, data production and geographical distribution needing explanations are marked with an asterisk (*). Additional information is given for each * entry in the Notes paragraphs following the list of each major group.
In the Common name column, the FAO English name (FAO 1994a, 1995c, 1996) for each species is listed; if it does not exist, other sources (CEC, 1993; Robins et al., 1991a,b; Turgeon et al., 1988; Williams et al., 1988) have been utilized. In a few cases, if an English name is missing or is rarely used because the species is mainly cultivated in non-English speaking countries, the common name in the local language has been listed (e.g., cachama blanca, Spanish and commonly used name for Piaractus brachypomus).
Environmental information is restricted to the salinity level of the water, divided into three categories: FreshWater, Brackish Water and Salt Water. Either the complete life cycle or successful adaptation trials have been taken in account to categorize the species. For example, anadromous and catadromous species belong to all the three categories and species such as Dicentrarchus labrax (European seabass), a eurhyhaline marine species which also lives in brackish water but which, as demonstrated in experimental aquaculture trials (Cataudella et al., 1991), can be reared also in freshwater, is also classified as a freshwater species.
For the geographical distribution by continent, the division by major fishing areas used in the FAO Yearbook of Fishery Statistics (1995c) for inland waters has been followed (Figure 1). North America is extended down to Panama and includes also the Caribbean countries. Marine species have been considered to be distributed in the continents which coasts lie along the oceans where the species are found (e.g., a species found in the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea is considered as present in Africa, Asia, Europe and Former USSR).
In light of the fact that the use of introduced species has significantly contributed to aquaculture production, as they have in terrestrial-based agriculture, and because aquaculture was the primary motivation for the introduction of exotic species into inland waters (Welcomme, 1988), the list designates species as native (N) or introduced (I), in regards to the continent where they are cultured. Note that when a species is listed as native (N) to a continent it should not be interpreted as being native to the entire continent. Information about introductions have been mainly taken from Welcomme (1988) and Courtenay et al. (1991) for fishes, Lee and Wickins (1992) for crustaceans, and from several sources for molluscs (Carlton, 1992; Moyle, 1991; Utting and Spencer, 1992).

3.2 NOTES ON FISHES
SCIENTIFIC NAMES
* In Robins et al. (1991b), Catla catla is listed as Gibelion catla because Gibelion Heckel, 1843, predates Catla Valenciennes, 1844 (Eschmeyer, 1990). Catla catla has been used here because it is more commonly used in the literature.
* Cirrhinus mulitorella used in FAO (1996) is a mispelling of C. molitorella (Robins et al., 1991b).
* In the synopsis on Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Jennings, 1988) and also in Eschmeyer (1990) and Robins et al. (1991a), Hypophthalmichthys is considered as the correct genus name and Aristichthys (used in FAO, 1996) a subjective synonym.
* Colossoma bidens is a synonym of Piaractus brachypomus (Hernandez, 1989; Robins et al., 1991b); Piaractus brachypomum and Colossoma brachypomum are also used for this species but are incorrect.
* Colossoma mitrei is considered a synonym of Piaractus mesopotamicus (Hernandez, 1989).
* Oncorhynchus mykiss is the widely accepted valid name for the rainbow trout, previously named Salmo gairdneri.
* The figures reported by Bolivia from 1989 to 1991 to FAO (1996) as Basilichthys bonariensis refer to Odontesthes bonariensis which is the actual valid name for the species that was introduced in Bolivia (Welcomme, 1988).
* The genus Fluta is a synonym of Monopterus (Eschmeyer, 1990).
* Acanthopagrus macrocephalus used in FAO (1996) is not listed in Japanese books (Masuda et al., 1984; Shirai, 1986); in Robins et al. (1991b), Mylio macrocephalus is considered a synonym of Acanthopagrus schlegeli.
* In this list the subspecies level is not considered, therefore Diplodus sargus sargus, for which Turkey reported statistics (FAO, 1996) from 1986 to 1993 (33 t) but not for 1994, is listed only at the species level (Diplodus sargus).
* Chrysophrys major and Sparus major are two synonyms still in use for Pagrus major (Robins, 1991b); anyhow the correct taxonomic name for this species is not still completely clearified because what should be the same species is called Pagrus auratus in some countries (e.g., Australia, in Kailola et al., 1993).
* Cichlasoma maculicauda is used in Ross and Martinez Palacios (1990) and in Robins et al. (1991b) instead of C. maculicaudum listed in FAO (1996).
* Trewavas (1983) considered Oreochromis urolepis a single species with two subspecies, Oreochromis urolepis urolepis and Oreochromis urolepis hornorum, but in current literature authors often refer to Oreochromis hornorum as a valid species. The information regarding the two subspecies have been here gathered under Oreochromis urolepis.
* Mugil capito is a still in use synonym of Liza ramada (Whitehead et al., 1984-86).
* Mugil brasiliensis is a synonym of Mugil liza (Fischer, 1978) that is still used.
* According with Kottelat (1989) and Robins et al. (1991b), striata is the correct species name for Channa instead of striatus.
* As already said above, the subspecies level is not considered here so Psetta maxima maxima is listed as Psetta maxima.
* Solea solea is synonym of Solea vulgaris still in use (Fischer et al., 1987).
COMMON NAMES
* Bocachico is a common name used in Latin America for species belongig to the family Curimatidae; it is applied also to Ichthyoelephas humeralis in the only reference (Cadena, 1981) found on this species in ASFA (1993,1996) records from 1978 to 1995.
* Dorada is a FAO Spanish name for Sparidae species but it is also used as common name for Brycon moorei (Otero, 1989).
* Colossoma macropomum is called cachama or cachama negra in Spanish speaking countries (Hernandez, 1989) and tambaqui in Brazil (Araujo, 1989).
* Pirapitinga is the vernacular name used in Brazil for Piaractus brachypomus (Araujo, 1989).
* Pacu is the Brazilian name for Piaractus mesopotamicus (Araujo, 1989).
* For Heterobranchus bidorsalis no more specific common name has been found than African catfish used in the literature (ASFA, 1996).
* Sampa, probably a local name, is listed in Robins et al. (1991b) as common name for Heterobranchus longifilis.
* South American catfish, although very generic, is the common name used for Rhamdia sapo in the literature (ASFA, 1996).
* In current literature (ASFA, 1996) the vernacular name atipa is used for Hoplosterum littorale instead of the name hassar listed in FAO (1996).
* Whitefish (CEC, 1993) and European whitefish (FAO, 1994a) are other common names used for Coregonus albula.
* Powan and pollan are others common names in English used for Coregonus lavaretus (CEC,1993).
* Barramundi, listed in FAO (1996) as the English FAO name for Lates calcarifer is mainly used in Australia, while in Asia this species is called Asian seabass or Giant seaperch (Robins, 1991b).
* Murray cod, the vernacular name used for Maccullochella peeli in Australia, has been preferred to Murray perch listed in FAO (1996).
* Areolate grouper is the English FAO name used in the FAO groupers catalogue (Heemstra and Randall, 1993) and is less generic than brown spotted grouper listed in FAO (1996).
* Snubnose pompano is the common name used in Fischer and Bianchi (1984) and Robins (1991b) for Trachinotus blochii and is less generic than Asian pompano used in FAO (1996).
* Red seabream is the common name used in the literature (ASFA, 1996) for Pagrus major; instead, the name silver seabream, listed in FAO (1996), is often used as common name for Rhabdosargus sarba.
* Tilapia is a common name used for all Oreochromis, Sarotherodon and Tilapia species; no more specific name has been found in use for Oreochromis spilurus and Tilapia guineensis.
PRODUCTION
* The total production of 202 t reported by Mali (2 t) and Nigeria (200 t) in FAO (1996) as Heterotis spp. probably refer to Heterotis niloticus.
* The single ton reported in 1994 (9 t in 1993) by Kazakstan to FAO (1996) as production of Aspius spp. should belong to Aspius aspius: in fact, all the articles consulted through ASFA (1996) regarding aquaculture of Aspius spp. in that area deal with Aspius aspius.
* The 2,500 t reported by France as production of Rutilus spp. should belong to Rutilus rutilus: in fact, all the articles consulted through ASFA (1996) regarding Rutilus spp. cultivated in France deal with Rutilus rutilus.
* Production figures reported by Ukraine (1 t) as Ictiobus spp. could belong either to Ictiobus cyprinellus or to Ictiobus niger, both species being introduced in the country (Welcomme, 1988).
* Production figures (27 t) reported by Peru as Colossoma bidens in FAO (1996) have been added to those of Colossoma brachypomum under the correct name of Piaractus brachypomus (see Taxonomy notes).
* Production figures (13,189 t) reported by Thailand for Pangasius pangasius could also refer to Pangasius sutchi which is commonly cultivated in Thailand.
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
* Geographical distribution of Abramis brama and Aspius aspius in Asia is restricted to a small area in Turkey (Blanc et al., 1971).
* According to Hecht et al. (1992), Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Mylopharyngodon piceus and Salmo salar have been imported in South Africa to experiment their culture.
* Clarias gariepinus has been introduced in Asian countries as described in Rahman et al. (1992).
* Clarias macrocephalus is listed in Nelson (1989) as cultured commercially in Guam: it has probably been introduced in the island but no record has been found.
* The native range of Oreochromis aureus in Asia is restricted to Israel and Jordan (Trewavas, 1983).
* An introduced population of Anabas testudineus was recorded in Florida (Courtenay and Robins, 1973) but it was later considered as extirpated (Courtenay et al., 1986).

4.2 NOTES ON CRUSTACEANS
SCIENTIFIC NAMES
* Penaeus orientalis is often used in place of Penaeus chinensis but is recognized as a synonym (Holthuis, 1980).
COMMON NAMES
* Black tiger shrimp is another name often used for Penaeus monodon (ASFA, 1996).
* Swimming crab is the most common name for Portunus trituberculatus (ASFA, 1996), but it is too generic.
* Indo-Pacific swamp crab has been chosen to replace mud crab as FAO English Name for Scylla serrata (FAO, 1994a).
* Chinese mitten crab is another name often used for Eriocheir sinensis (ASFA, 1996).
PRODUCTION
* In FAO (1995d) the production previously reported by Philippines as Peneaus indicus (FAO, 1994b) was moved under Metapenaeus endeavouri but this species, according to Holthuis (1980) and Dore and Frimodt (1987) is distributed only along the west, north and east coasts of Australia where is a fisheries resource but is not cultured (Kailola et al., 1993). No one report of its introduction in the Philippines has been found in ASFA (1996) nor M. endeavouri is mentioned as one of the marine shrimp species (Penaeus monodon, Penaeus indicus, Penaeus merguensis, Metapenaeus ensis) commercially cultivated in the Philippines (Rabanal and Soesanto, 1987). Then, the 1,843 t reported for Metapenaeus endeavouri in FAO (1996) could still probably belong to Penaeus indicus. In this case Metapenaeus endeavouri should be cancelled from this list.
* The production of 12,500 t reported (FAO, 1996) by Viet Nam under the item "Freshwater crustaceans not identified" should belong to Macrobrachium rosenbergii which is the most important freshwater crustacean cultivated in Vietnam (Lin and Lee, 1992, Hung, 1992).
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
* Geographical distribution of Metapenaeus endeavouri is reported as restricted to west, north and east coasts of Australia (Holthuis,1980; Dore and Frimodt, 1987) but statistics for this species has been reported by Philippines (FAO, 1995d and 1996). See above, under Production, for other details.
* Geographical distribution of Homarus gammarus in Asia is restricted to a small area of Turkey (Holthuis, 1991).
* Eriocheir sinensis was introduced in Europe (Welcomme, 1988) and in North America (Willams et al., 1989) probably in the ballast water of ships (Moyle, 1991). The species, considered a delicacy in China, is a pest in Europe (Welcomme, 1988).

5.2 NOTES ON MOLLUSCS
SCIENTIFIC NAMES
* The taxonomy of Haliotis discus is very confused (Hahn, 1989). A subspecies, H. discus hannai, is recognized in Japanese waters, but H. discus hannai is morphologically, ecologically and genetically different from H. discus (Ino, 1980).
* Haliotis tuberculata (Fischer et al., 1987) is the correct species name instead of Haliotis tubercolata listed in FAO (1996).
* Mytilus chilensis is often considered as a local form of Mytilus edulis (De Franssu, 1990).
* Mytilus crassitesta (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Mytilus coruscus (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Mytilus planulatus is treated as a subspecies of Mytilus edulis by some authors (Mytilus edulis planulatus in Kailola et al., 1993).
* Mytilus canaliculus (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Perna canaliculus (Paul, 1986; Poutiers, 1993a).
* Mytilus smaragdinus and Mytilus viridis (FAO, 1996) are synonyms of Perna viridis (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Arca granosa and Tegillarca granosa are synonyms sometimes used instead of the correct Anadara granosa (Poutiers, 1993a)
* Anadara broughtonii and Arca inflata are synonyms sometimes used for Scapharca broughtonii (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Anadara subcrenata and Arca subcrenata are synonyms sometimes used for Scapharca subcrenata (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Pinctada vulgaris is a synonym of Pinctada fucata (Alagarswami, 1991; Poutiers, 1993a). Japanese taxonomists recognized Pinctada fucata martensii as a subspecies of P. fucata (Wada, 1991).
* Chlamys opercularis (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Aequipecten opercularis (Fischer et al., 1987; Poutiers, 1993a).
* Argopecten circularis, listed in FAO (1996), is considered by Waller (1991) and Poutiers (1995) a synonym of Argopecten ventricosus but most of mexican papers (Felix-Pico, 1991; ASFA, 1996) consider Argopecten circularis as a valid species.
* Pecten yessoensis (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Patinopecten yessoensis (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Crassostrea (or Saccostrea) lugubris is a synonym of Crassostrea belcheri (Poutiers, 1993a).
* Crassostrea angulata (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Crassostrea gigas (Fischer et al., 1987; De Franssu, 1990; Poutiers, 1993a).
* Crassostrea commercialis (FAO, 1996) is treated by some authors (De Franssu, 1990; Poutiers, 1993a) as a synonym of Crassostrea cucullata but in Australia, where it is extensively cultured (6,378 t in 1994), it is considered as a valid distinct species belonging to the genus Saccostrea (Kailola et al., 1993).
* Cardium edule (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Cerastoderma edule (Tebble, 1966).
* Tapes pullastra (FAO, 1996) is a synonym of Venerupis pullastra (Fischer et al., 1987; De Franssu, 1990; Poutiers, 1993a).
COMMON NAMES
* Ormer is another common name often used for Haliotis tuberculata (ASFA, 1996).
* Common periwinkle used in Turgeon et al. (1988) is a bit more specific than periwinkle used in FAO (1995c).
* Queen conch is another name often used for Strombus gigas (Appeldoorn and Rodríguez, 1994).
* The Australian name for Mytilus planulatus is blue mussel (Kailola et al., 1993).
* Perna canaliculus is called green mussel in New Zealand (Paul, 1986).
* Another English common name often used for Anadara granosa is granular ark (De Franssu, 1990).
* Pinctada maxima is also called gold-lip pearl oyster (Alagarswami, 1991; Gervis and Sims, 1992).
* Great Atlantic scallop used in De Franssu (1990) is less generic than common scallop used for Pecten maximus in FAO (1996).
* American sea scallop has replaced sea scallop as the FAO English name for Placopecten magellanicus (FAO, 1994a and 1996). Probably, the common name Atlantic deep-sea scallop used by Abbott (1968) would define still better this species.
* Slipper cupped oyster (De Franssu, 1990) is more used than Philippine cupped oyster (FAO, 1996) in papers dealing with Crassostrea iredalei (ASFA, 1996).
* Sidney rock oyster is the Australian vernacular name for Saccostrea commercialis (Kailola, 1993; ASFA, 1996).
* Northern quahog has replaced hard clam as the FAO English name for Mercenaria mercenaria (FAO, 1994a and 1996).
* Japanese carpet shell is the FAO English name for Ruditapes philippinarum (De Franssu, 1990; FAO, 1996). Other names often used are Manila clam and Japanese littleneck.
* Pullet carpet shell is used as FAO English name in Fischer et al. (1987) and De Franssu (1990) instead of the less precise carpet shell listed in FAO (1996).
* Sand gaper (De Franssu, 1990) is the most definite name for Mya arenaria. Other names such as soft clam, soft shell and soft shell clam are also used but are too generic.
PRODUCTION
* Production of 1,048 t of Haliotis spp. listed in FAO (1996) under Other Asia could belong to Haliotis diversicolor (Hahn, 1989).
* Being Littorina littorea the only Littorina species of commercial importance in France (Poutiers, 1993b) the production (1,110 t) of Littorina spp. reported to FAO (1996) by France should belong to Littorina littorea.
* Production of 6 t of Strombus spp. reported to FAO (1996) by Netherlands Antilles (5 t) and Turks and Caicos (1 t) should belong to Strombus gigas (Hensen, 1991; Appeldoorn and Rodríguez, 1994).
* According with Menzel (1988) and Nie (1991) the three most important mussel species cultivated in China are Mytilus edulis, Perna viridis and Mytilus coruscus. The production of 415,222 t reported by China as Mytilidae to FAO (1996) probably belong to these three species.
* The production reported to FAO (1996) as Mytilus smaragdinus (38,582 t) and Mytilus viridis (969 t) have been merged under Perna viridis (see Scientific names above).
* The production of 13,646 t reported by Korea Rep. as Arca spp. (FAO, 1996) should belong to one or more of the three Arcidae species listed (Anadara granosa, Scapharca broughtonii and Scapharca subcrenata).
* Statistics for pearl oysters are not reported to FAO (1996) at the species level and are grouped under the name "Ex Pinctada spp.". The most part (93% of 17,351 t) of the total production is reported by Japan where all four the species listed are cultivated; according with figures on spat production in Japan (Wada, 1993), other sources such as Gervis and Sims (1992) and the number of records in ASFA (1996), the species which probably gives the highest contribution to the production figures is Pinctada fucata .
* Chlamys farreri is an important species in Chinese aquaculture. Rucai and Lian-chen (1991) reported a production of about 7,500 t for each year from 1983 to 1985 in the Changdao County and Shandong Province.
* Production reported for Crassostrea angulata (15,000 t by France and 1,063 t by Portugal) have been merged with those of Crassostra gigas (see under Scientific Names above).
* In Nie's revision (1991) on bivalve aquaculture in China no Solen species is included, while it is stated that "Over half of the total yield of cultivated species of bivalves in the Provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang is of this species [Sinonovacula constricta]." This quotation and also the number of papers dealing with Sinonovacula constricta in China (25 papers listed in ASFA, 1996, compared to only 2 about Solen spp.) indicate that the production figures (252,886 t) reported by China to FAO (1996) as Solen spp. should instead belong to Sinonovacula constricta which is also similar in shape to Solen spp.
* Part or all the production (11,147 t) reported for Corbicula japonica by Other Asia and grouped under the category Freshwater molluscs in FAO (1996) could probably belong to Corbicula fluminea: in fact, C. fluminea is a freshwater-brackish water species while C. japonica is a marine-brackish water species and C. fluminea seems also more common as cultured species in Asia, in particular in Taiwan (Lovatelli, 1988; Liao, 1990) while C. japonica is a major commercial species in Japan (Poutiers, 1993a). The commercial culture of C. fluminea has been considered in the U.S. (Phelps, 1992) where the species has been introduced by Asian immigrants in the 30's but its release in the environment has affected local mussel populations in streams (Neves and Williams, 1994).
* There are also 19,587 t reported for Mercenaria mercenaria to FAO (1996) as Other Asia, but this production can not belong to this species because it is distributed only in Central and North Atlantic and has been introduced in Europe (Utting and Spencer, 1992); no record has been found of any introduction in Asia. The production reported probably belong to Meretrix lusoria which is called hard clam as Mercenaria mercenaria (see Common Names above).
* The production reported by Italy (27,000 t) under Tapes spp. (FAO, 1996) could either belong to Ruditapes decussatus or Ruditapes philippinarum.
ENVIRONMENT
* Sinonovacula constricta occurs in estuaries and bays with little freshwater inflow, at salinities of 4 to 29U, optimum 7 to 26U (Nie, 1991).
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
* Argopecten irradians is present in South America with the subspecies A. irradians amplicostatus (Abbott, 1968, Cervigon et al., 1992).

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Data on production, number of species and introduced species from the three major animal groups have been summarized in Table 1. As it is shown in Figure 2, Asia produces most of world's aquaculture (84.9% of the total production reported at the species level to FAO, 1996). Europe is the second continent in quantity of aquaculture production but produces only 8.2% of the total. This striking difference from Asia and the other continents is not so evident in the number of species: in fact, the Asian production of more than 13 million of tons comes from the culture of 75 species while Europe produce ten times less using more than half the number of species used in Asia (Table 1).
Regarding introduced species, Asia, together with the Former USSR, is the continent in which introduced species give the lowest contribution to the total production of the continent (Figure 3). In Asia there are many important cultivated species native of the continent and then only four species have been introduced from other continents. Introduced species form a very important part of aquaculture production in other continents: 97.1% of crustaceans production in Europe, 96.2% of fishes production in South America, 84.7% in Oceania. Overall, 9.7% of aquaculture production comes from introduced species.
Although this list shows that world animal aquaculture is mainly based on about 260 species, the bulk of the production comes from a much more limited number of species. In fact, 31 species account for 95% of the total production reported to FAO (1996) (Table 2). Pullin (1995), using FAO and Taiwanese official statistics, made an estimate much higher: 105 finfish, 43 molluscs, 27 crustaceans and 6 seaweeds species would produce the 95% of farmed aquatic production. A similar exercise has been done for agriculture (Prescott-Allen and Prescott-Allen, 1990) and it demonstrated that 103 species of plants contribute 90% of the world's plant food supply and 95% of livestock production comes from 5 species of animals.
Among the three major groups, 17 finfish species constitute 95% of the total fish production reported to FAO at the species level: between these, the first five and a total of eleven are cyprinids (Figure 4). Crustaceans have the smallest number of species reported, but the highest percentage of species contributing to the 95% of total production which means that the bulk of production is distributed on a higher number of species in proportion (Table 2). On the total, about one fifth (18.9%) of the species reported produce the 95% of the total production at the species level.
The number of species important to aquaculture is steadily increasing but not at the rate that was expected as a consequence of the effort of researchers and farmers in experimenting new species suitable for aquaculture: considering a period of eleven years from 1984 to 1994, the total number of reports to FAO, at the species and at other taxonomic levels, has increased by 24.6%, respectively 39.1% at the species level and 18.5% at less defined taxonomic levels (Table 3). This could indicate a slight increase in the accuracy of the reporting of production data by Member countries but many problems still remain to be solved to improve the quality of aquaculture statistics (FAO, 1995b).

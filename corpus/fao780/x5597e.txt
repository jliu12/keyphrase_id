<title>CIFA Occasional Paper No. 22 CIFA/OP22. Support Aquaculture Development in Africa: Aquatic Farming Systems Information </title>
<section>1</section>
1. ORIGIN, ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES OF THE MISSION
As a follow-up to the Study on International Fisheries Research (SIFR,1989-91), FAO in collaboration with the Economic Commission for Africa and the European Union, launched in 1992 a regional study on aquaculture development and research in sub-Saharan Africa.
The resulting synthesis of the information presented in 12 national reviews on development and research needs provided the basis for proposing an indicative action plan for aquaculture research in sub-Saharan Africa (CIFA Technical Papers 23 and 23 suppl., 1994) .
Nine priority areas were identified among which information collection, storage and dissemination through networking was considered as an essential and top priority programme.
As follow-up, and using the Partnership Programme Scheme, the Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service of the FAO Fisheries Department, organized in October 1996 a project identification/formulation mission in sub-Saharan Africa with the following objectives:
* to visit some of the existing institutions previously identified as potential contributors to an information network on aquatic farming systems;
* to evaluate the resources (infrastructure, trained staff, equipment, collections and network-ing activities) available at each of these institutions to contribute to such a network;
* to ascertain existing interest and willingness to do so;
* to identify possible ways for activating this new information network at the sub-Saharan African level;
* to formulate a project to support the initial implementation of the network;
The identification/formulation mission was composed as follows:
- André G. Coche Mission leader, Consultant, Rome, Italy
- Jean Collins (Ms.) Librarian, FAO Fisheries Department, Rome, Italy
- Antoinette Ziehi (Mrs.) Aquaculture Researcher, IDESSA, Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire
This mission visited various institutions in Western, Eastern, Southern and Sahelian Africa between October 24 and November 20, 1996 as follows:
* from 24 to 29 Oct., Côte d'Ivoire (Coche and Collins)
- Centre de Recherches Océanologiques and future RECOSCIX-CEA, in Abidjan;
- Institut des Savanes (IDESSA), in Bouaké;
- West African Rice Development Association, in Bouaké;
- INFOPECHE, in Abidjan;
* from 30 Oct. to 1 Nov., Mali (Collins and Ziehi)
- Institut du Sahel/RESADOC, in Bamako;
- Ministère du Développement Rural et de l'Environnement, in Bamako;
- Institut d' Economie Rurale, in Bamako;
* from 4 to 12 Nov., Nigeria (Ziehi)

- Ministry of Agriculture, Central Library, in Harare;
* from 18 to 20 Nov., South Africa (Coche)
- J.L.B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology, in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape;
- Rhodes University, Department of Ichthyology and Fisheries Science, in Grahamstown;
- Rhodes University, main library, in Grahamstown;
A more detailed schedule of the mission together with a list of people met are provided in Annex 1.
The mission was planned with the following set of guiding principles in mind:
* coverage of as many of the five sub-Saharan agroecological regions as possible;
* coverage of both francophone and anglophone regions;
* emphasis on existing institutions;
* emphasis on existing databases;
* emphasis on existing information networks;
* interest in information related to:
- aquatic farming systems;
- research aspects; and
- development aspects;
with the central focus on fish production through small to medium-scale freshwater aquaculture and the management of small water bodies.
With reference to this last point, in addition to information sources on the biological and technical aspects of fish production, it was considered as essential also to access information related to all the other components of the production system, such as the producers themselves, their crops and animal production, and the external factors influencing development in general (e.g. markets and government support). Information, for example, related to rural sociology, agricultural economics, human nutrition and food security, environmental impact, water conservation, and rural extension methods/services were as far as possible included in the survey. Multidisciplinary libraries were therefore considered as being particularly well suited to participate in the envisaged information network.
A standardised questionnaire was developed in order to assist in the collection of relevant data from each institution and library visited. The format is a modified version of the one developed by EURASLIC to produce the Directory of European Aquatic Sciences Libraries and Information Centres.
The completed questionnaires in Annex 3 provide data on the libraries visited, together with an overview of their information activities, services and the networks in which they participate.
The observations on the libraries visited relate only to the possibilities for collaboration and their strengths and/or constraints are considered only in the context of an information network for aquatic farming systems. There is no intention of evaluating the libraries per se, nor of commenting on their primary role or activities within other areas.

2. OVERVIEW OF INFORMATION RESOURCES FOR AQUATIC FARMING SYSTEMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
2.1 Côte dIvoire
2.1.1 Centre de recherches océanologiques (CRO), Abidjan
Created in 1958, this research centre was managed by ORSTOM until 1991 when it was reorganised as a National Public Institution. It consists of four Research Departments: Environment, Aquatic Living Resources, Aquaculture and Scientific Information/ Documentation. Programmes are defined and carried out by Ivorian scientists in partnership with researchers from other organizations, ORSTOM remaining a privileged partner.
Aquaculture research concentrates on three fish species: Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Heterobranchus longifilis and Sarotherodon melanotheron. The fields of research include controlled reproduction, nutrition/feeding, genetics, parasitology and development of intensive culture systems. The use of acadjas in lagoon enclosures has also been recently studied.
The library has a large well organized collection and professionally qualified staff to provide information services to its primary users, i.e. the researchers of CRO. Subscriptions to several current journals are maintained from CRO programme budgets, including aquaculture. The library is accessible for external users and responds to requests for photocopies and bibliographic searches. The library catalogue is a Micro CDS/ISIS database and records are provided to the REDACI network, and subsequently transmitted to AGRIS. In 1993 CRO was selected by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission to be the regional despatch centre for the RECOSCIX-CEA network. The latter, modelled on the Western Indian Ocean network, has completed its pilot phase and IOC is seeking a donor in order for the network to become operational. During the pilot phase the ASFA CD ROM (1978-1981 and 1982-1992) was donated by CSA, but no further updates have been obtained. The RECOSCIX-CEA network will
use ASFIS as the methodology for database construction and indexing. The librarian has been trained in the use of ASFISIS for input to the ASFA database but is not yet using the software. It was stated that the conversion of records from the ASFISIS format to the REDACI format is not expected to cause problems.
2.1.2 Institut des Savanes (IDESSA), Bouaké
Created in 1982, this institute focuses its research on crop and animal production best adapted to savannah conditions. Its sub-Direction of Scientific and Technical Affairs consists of three departments: Industrial Crops, Cash Crops and Animal Resources (Livestock and Pisciculture). This last department is organized into three Research Units:
* Animal Production: pathology, ichthyology, genetics/conservation, nutrition/feeding;
* Animal Production Systems: production techniques/systems, socio-economics/statistics;
* Management/Enhancement of Rearing Environments: aquatic and terrestrial.
Aquaculture activities are concentrated in Kokondékro, 5 km from Bouaké, at the research and training centre established in 1955 by CTFT Pisciculture Division. Apart from earthen ponds, offices, laboratories and class rooms, this centre includes also a small specialised library.
Specialised 9-month training courses for medium-level technicians have been organised at national and international level for many years, depending on available external funding.
Aquaculture research has been focused on four species: Oreochromis niloticus, Heterobranchus isopterus, Lates niloticus and Labeo coubie. Both extensive (in small water reservoirs) and semi-intensive (in earthen ponds) culture systems have been investigated. Actual lack of funds hamper research efforts.
The library has a very large and comprehensive collection up to 1982 when four French research stations, including the Centre de Recherches Piscicoles of Centre Technique Forestier Tropical (CTFT), were merged and IDESSA created. Since then the library budget has been negligible and the collection now depends upon donations or exchange publications or upon donor organizations. However, the older collections are well organized and accessible and still heavily used by the researchers at IDESSA. The former CTFT Centre de Recherches Piscicoles library forms the major part of the specialised collection at Kokondékro. This library, which mainly serves the aquaculture researchers at the Station, the students and staff of the Centre de Formation Piscicole at Bouaké and participants attending IDESSA regional training courses for francophone Africa, has no current periodical subscriptions and is presently housed in a very small, overcrowded room. Thanks to funding from the Caisse
Francaise de Cooperation, a bigger and more suitable building nearby is in the process of being renovated and the library should move early next year. Again the collection is well organized, catalogued and indexed in a Micro CDS/ISIS database and a full-time library assistant looks after registration of incoming material and loans. The same donor has provided the PC, printer and CD ROM reader, unfortunately for the library they are being used by researchers and very little disk space is left.
The librarian has a first degree in agronomy and has taken supplementary modules in documentation. She is responsible for the IDESSA main library and four specialised branch libraries, of which the Station Piscicole is one. A library clerk is responsible for the routine operation of each unit. The survey form on IDESSA refers only to the Station Piscicole library and does not reflect the very large collection held in the main library. Again, this is mainly the collections of the four French research stations and the only substantial new additions are donations. These include a consignment of approximately 200 new scientific monographs obtained through the DORA scheme of CTA.
The library has no CD ROM databases but the librarian periodically travels to WARDA in order to do bibliographic searches on behalf of users.
The library is a member of the national agricultural documentation network, REDACI, coordinated at the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in Abidjan, which is also the national AGRIS input centre. IDESSA is also listed as one of the participants in the RECOSCIX-CEA network.
2.1.3 West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA), Bouaké
Situated in Mbe, 25 km from IDESSA north of Bouaké. Visited for the purpose of seeing the facilities available for the IDESSA librarian to do database searches and also to hear of developments in telecommunications and Internet connectivity. The library of this CGIAR Institute has an extensive collection, excellent facilities and a large number of agricultural CD ROM databases. They have E-mail but as yet the Internet connection has not extended beyond Bouaké. For this reason WARDA as decided to implement satellite connection to the Internet.
2.1.4 Infopêche, Abidjan
The regional inter-governmental fish marketing and trade organization, Infopeche, is based in Abidjan and has national partners in 14 West African countries. The library of Infopêche is rich in FAO fisheries publications and in the grey fisheries literature of its member countries. The collection totals some 8 000 documents, the library maintains several current periodical subscriptions and includes a substantial amount on aquaculture. The librarian was trained originally in Aquaculture at Bouaké and subsequently took modules of para-professional documentation courses. The library catalogue is computerised using DBASE which means that it is not compatible with the libraries of other institutions and its records are not available to EDACI.
2.2 Mali
2.2.1 Institut d'économie rurale (IER), Bamako
IER was created in 1960 and comes under the Ministry of Rural Development and the Environment and is responsible for agricultural research in Mali. The Institute has a total of 400 staff, of which 100 are researchers, and it conducts 14 research programmes including 5 research projects in fisheries and aquaculture. The fisheries projects are based at Mopti and the funds for research are provided from the national budget, the Projet National de Recherches Agronomiques /Banque Mondiale (PNRA) or ORSTOM. In the latter case, the research is carried out in collaboration, for example research on the Niger Delta. IER is also involved with the EU coordinated Network for Humid Zones and in joint projects with ICRAF and CETAGRI.
The Library of IER covers the rural economic aspects of all sectors at institutional and national level. It has a very large collection, particularly of grey literature, and includes 26 current periodicals, over 1200 monographs, 7500 reports and over 8500 microfiche.
The condition of the library is somewhat overcrowded and the organization of the collection probably daunting for most users. However, there are plans to re-organize and they have started computerization of the catalogue using Micro CDS/ISIS. The librarian has an MA in library science and is actively involved in information activities at national and regional level. IER coordinates the national agricultural documentation network, REMADOC, which has input centres in all of the agricultural research centres in Mali. It is also the national RESADOC partner for Mali and the national input centre for AGRIS/CARIS. They have, however, not provided input to the latter since 1994, at the time when IER started to use Micro CDS/ISIS using the BABINAT format.
2.2.2 Institut du Sahel (INSAH), Bamako
INSAH is a specialised institution of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), responsible for coordinating, harmonising and promoting scientific and technical research in the nine Sahelian countries (Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad). The strategy employed to reach these objectives is to strengthen national research capacities and to promote regional cooperation and collaboration.
INSAH has two major programmes:
* Population and Development: demographic policies, sub-regional cooperation; research, training, technical assistance, information activities;
* Agro-socio-economic research: appropriate technologies, socio-economic research, food security, natural resources management; support to a network of national documentation centres (RESADOC) and training of its staff.
Although none of the CILSS institutions has fisheries or aquaculture as priority areas, they do cover the related environmental, socioeconomic and rural development aspects important to aquatic farming systems in the Sahelian zone.
As part of the strategy to strengthen and coordinate national capacities in information management and dissemination, INSAH was given the responsibility to coordinate the RESADOC network which started its activities in 1980. RESADOC covers twenty broad subject areas and provides a regional resource of information and documentation related to the Sahel. National documentation centres nominated by CILSS in Mauritania, Chad, Cape Verde, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali, Niger and Guinea Bissau have the responsibility to collect relevant publications and provide catalogue records to INSAH, which then incorporates them into RESADOC. The input has always been prepared on paper and keyboarded at INSAH which maintains the database and a copy of the documents either printed or on microfiche. It then satisfies requests for database searches and photocopies of documents to the RESADOC partners or other institutions for a fee. The database contains over 22 000 records, of which only about 1%
relate to fisheries or aquaculture, and INSAH has over 6 000 documents on microfiche as well as an extensive collection of publications related to the Sahel. Outputs from the database include the annual RESINDEX and specialised bibliographies. RESADOC has been maintained up to now using MINISIS software but INSAH has recently converted to Micro CDS/ISIS, with some difficulties.
Until 1991/92 RESADOC was very active in terms of the use of the database and its products, training activities for national partners, the production of microfiche documents etc. Since then the level of input has declined and usage has dropped. An evaluation of RESADOC by IDRC in 1995 resulted in a decision by CILSS to restructure and revitalize the network. The information programme at INSAH has been re-structured in the new Sahelian Communication Project (PROSACOM). This includes RESADOC and the Documentation Centre, production and dissemination of publications, training in documentation and publishing. The staff of national centres are meeting at INSAH in November 1996 to review the methodologies used and to address the needs of the input centres in the light of technological developments. Funding has been provided to create an electronic mail network, with USAID providing equipment including a LAN to be installed at INSAH and at the centres in Mali, Senegal, Niger and
Burkina Faso funded by the Netherlands. INSAH is expecting full Internet connection by the end of 1996.
RESADOC has also in the past cooperated with AGRIS, although the problems of compatibility between the systems continues. Much of the content of RESADOC is outside of the scope of AGRIS and it is considered to be more relevant and targetted towards the information needs of the CILSS members.
In addition to its own RESADOC database, INSAH has been offered a choice of CD ROMs through the CTA programme and has recently requested AGRIS and TROPAG.
2.2.3 Direction nationale des ressources forestières, fauniques et halieutiques. Division pêche et pisciculture
Also within the Ministry of Rural Development and the Environment and as such has collaborative research projects and activities with IER, for example the fishery resources project at Mopti.
The Direction has a library which apparently does not cover the fisheries and aquaculture sectors and the Division staff rely on donations or private collections. Unfortunately the library was closed on the day we visited as the librarian was attending a REMADOC meeting.
2.3 Nigeria
2.3.1 University of Ibadan, Ibadan
This is one of several large multidisciplinary universities providing courses and degrees in aquaculture and related subjects at BSc, MSc and PhD levels. The responsible unit is the Department of Wildlife Management and Fisheries, within the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry.
Created in 1981, this Department today offers numerous specializations such as natural reserves management, nutrition, fish reproduction, aquatic ecology, pond construction/ management, aquariology, development projects preparation/feasibility studies. It has a fish farm where research programmes on tilapias, African catfish and common carp are implemented.
The Kenneth Dike Library was created in 1948 and is the oldest university library in Nigeria. It comprises the Main Library and several specialized faculty libraries, including one in Agriculture and Forestry. The disciplines covered are the pure and applied sciences, law, art and social science.
The library staff consists of 22 professionals with at least graduate and mostly postgraduate qualifications. The collection includes over one million volumes and 6 000 current periodicals, although there have been recent budget reductions. The aquaculture collection is very small and is less than 5% of the Agriculture and Forestry library.
The library is well equipped and has over 20 PCs connected to a Local Area Network, although the Agriculture and Forestry library has no PC. The Library has electronic mail but no Internet connection. They have benefitted under the CTA CD ROM Program and have selected CABI and TROPAG. The library catalogue is in the process of being automated using the TINLIB software.
There is no national university library network other than informal cooperation. A project funded by AAAS between 1993 and 1996 has also provided CD ROM databases for university libraries in seven African countries and set up an inter-library lending system. It apparently has had little success due to institutional and communication problems.
The Department of Chemistry is involved in a project funded by the Carnegie Corporation to produce a bibliographic database on Nigerian research. It includes material published in or about Nigeria on medicine, technology and engineering, natural sciences, agriculture, social sciences, applied sciences and education. It contains over 100 000 referen-ces and bibliographic searches are provided for a fee.
2.3.2 International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan
This CGIAR institute specializes in research on all tropical crops except rice. The library, which is also open to external users, has an excellent collection and many CD ROM databases. Internal databases are managed using BASIS software and Micro CDS/ISIS is used for input to AGRIS. A Local Area Network connects all the institutes PCs.
2.4 Kenya
2.4.1 Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Mombasa
Established in 1979, the Institute is responsible at national level for carrying out scientific research in the fields of marine and freshwater fisheries/aquaculture, aquatic biology (including environmental and ecological studies) and oceanography. But facilities for aquaculture research at the Institute itself are very limited and most of its programmes actually focus on monitoring of coastal marine water quality.
The Library and Information Services are well organised, in close collaboration with the RECOSCIX-WIO Project (Section 2.4.2). They are staffed by professionally qualified staff to provide information to their local primary users, the KMFRI researchers. Forty serial titles are currently maintained mostly through regional exchanges. A large collection of about 2500 books are grouped into nine main subject areas: aquaculture, fisheries, fish processing/preservation, limnology, marine biology/biological oceanography, marine geology, physical/chemical oceanography, pollution studies and natural products/by-products from fish and other aquatic resources. Marketing and socio-economics should be added in the near future.
The library catalogue is a Micro CDS/ISIS database. Email services are also available. Connection to Internet is under development.
2.4.2 Project: Regional Cooperation in Scientific Information Exchange in the West Indian Ocean Region (RECOSCIX-WIO), Mombasa
This IOC/UNESCO Project funded by Belgium since 1991 and implemented in collaboration with KMFRI by the Limburg University Centre operates jointly with the above library. Its main objectives are:
* to provide marine scientists in the WIO Region with necessary bibliographic and scientific literature;
* to make full use of scientific literature available in the region;
* to promote and facilitate communication between marine scientists in the WIO Region and also with other regions;
* to promote the scientific work of WIO marine scientists in and outside the WIO Region;
* to provide the scientific equipment, software and training.
During the actual second phase of the project (1996-99), the focus will be on library services and on services in data management, in particular the distribution of mass data using CD-ROM technology.
At present there are 61 cooperating institutions and 23 cooperating libraries. Member countries are Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia and Tanzania. About 300 scientists are working in the WIO Region of which 60 percent are in Kenya and 20 percent in Tanzania.
The following activities are carried out:
* query handling: provision of bibliographic information through access to local and remote databases (1995=85 requests for 13 695 citations delivered);
* document delivery: provision of scientific literature in the form of photocopies of publications, mostly journal articles, in collaboration with cooperating libraries throughout the world (1995=3 379 requests and 2 639 deliveries);
* current awareness: the contents tables of nine foreign periodicals are copied and sent to the cooperating institutes;
* WIOLIB: creation of a computerised union catalogue of the cooperating institutes library holdings;
* WIODIR: database with information on marine scientists of the cooperating institutes ;
* WIOPUB: bibliography of publications of the marine scientists in the WIO Region relevant to the aquatic sciences;
* WINDOW: a bilingual (English-French) newsletter (1995=1 325 copies/issue distributed).
In 1995, KMFRI/RECOSCIX-WIO became a regional input centre for the ASFA database.
2.5 Malawi
2.5.1 Bunda College of Agriculture, Lilongwe
Founded in 1966 as part of the University of Malawi, this College includes five teaching/research Departments:
* Animal Science: breeding, physiology, nutrition, health and aquaculture are the five main priority areas; facilities include a 25-ha livestock farm, research units for rabbit, pig and goat production as well as a 15 ha fish farm; it is a regional centre for teaching at Masters level for the SADC Inland Fisheries Sector;
* Crop Science: among others botany, agronomy, soil science, agroforestry, and biometry/statistics;
* Rural Development: demography, agricultural economics, extension, rural sociology, farm management and agricultural policy; it prepares extension packages for small holders and estate farmers;
* Agricultural Engineering: farm structures, food processing, farm machinery, animal traction, land husbandry, soil/water conservation and environmental studies; data management and analysis are also emphasised;
* Home Economics and Human Nutrition: food science, nutrition, child/family development.
The Library of Bunda College is well known both in and outside the region for its resources of well-qualified staff, extensive collections and the services it provides. The new library building, funded by USAID, is large and purpose built to provide an attractive environment with excellent facilities for reading and study areas, computerised information services, training and a large collection of books and periodicals as well as audio-visual materials. The library budget is mainly provided by the college itself.
The library is building up its collection of aquaculture information to meet the needs of staff and students of the SADC Regional Training Programme. Some funding for this is provided by JICA, ICEIDA and SIAST. In addition to internal users, the library serves many external clients in Malawi, including NGOs, the private sector and consultants. In addition to providing information from its own collection and via cooperation with other libraries in Malawi, Bunda has an account with CABI for copies of articles requested by E-mail and they have recently received $1 000 worth of Unesco interlibrary coupons from CTA.
Bunda is an FAO and EPA repository library and has large collections of microfiche and audio-visual materials, as well as the equipment to exploit these. They have 8 Pcs, four of which have CD ROM drives and printers. The College E-mail is managed by the library but as yet there is no Internet connection and VSAT satellite connection is being investigated.
Databases are maintained using Micro CDS/ISIS, the MARC format and the CABI thesaurus. Several specialized internal subject databases include ones on maize, women, environment, theses and Malawiana. The records of the latter are contributed to the national Malawi database and Bunda maintains copies of all the documents in a special collection. The library also has many CD ROM databases, including AGRIS, ASFA, CABI, Fish and Fisheries Worldwide, FISHBASE, TROPAG, Agricola. Unfortunately most of these are now superseded as they were one off donations and Bunda is unable to maintain subscriptions.
Bunda is the Malawi focal point for SAAINET and it cooperates with the Ministry of Agriculture Library at Chitedze in preparing input to AGRIS. They also cooperate with Chitedze on the exchange of contents pages of journals and as part of the University of Malawi library network receive catalogue records downloaded from the BIBLIOPHILE CD ROM.
2.5.2 Southern African Development Community, Inland Fisheries Sector Technical Coordination Unit (SADC/IFSTCU), Lilongwe
The library of SADC/IFSTCU is charged with the collection, management and coordination of the documents produced by the relevant government departments involved with inland fisheries and aquaculture in the SADC countries. SADC/IFSTCU is funded by Iceland and the Technical Coordination Unit is based in Lilongwe. The library of the Coordination Unit also collects relevant documents from other organizations and is building up a documentation centre with regional coverage. Each national focal point is responsible for the collection of documents and input of records to a PROCITE database. This software, which is a commercial package, was chosen in preference to Micro CDS/ISIS as most of the Ministries involved do not have a trained librarian with experience of the latter. PROCITE is more user-friendly and it will be possible to create exchangeable databases on diskette with a minimum of training.
A regional fisheries information programme has been defined and will commence in 1997. One drawback has been that the Government of Malawi has not been able to provide a counterpart for training by the Icelandic librarian during the first year of the project. This is partly because all the well-qualified librarians in Malawi have jobs, but it is expected that one will be appointed by the end of 1996.
2.6 Zimbabwe
2.6.1 Aquaculture for Local Community Development Programme (ALCOM), Harare
Initiated in 1987, ALCOM is a regional community-based programme funded by Belgium/Sweden and executed by FAO. Today it collaborates in various ways with SADC member-countries and has pilot projects in five of them. The programme seeks to develop, test and demonstrate strategies, methods and techniques by which rural smallholders can improve their living standards through the management of available aquatic resources. It focuses on small-scale aquaculture integrated into the local farming system, on the management of fish resources in small water reservoirs, and on rural extension methodology and organization. A related activity is establishing a Southern African database for such reservoirs, including their socio-economic setting.
The ALCOM library has a unique collection of about 7 000 holdings of books, published and unpublished reports, reprints and journals on the technological and socio-economic aspects of aquaculture and aquatic resources development, in particular in Southern Africa.
Its computerised catalogue, a Micro CDS/ISIS application is available to any interested user or institution. It is accessible together with several specialised databases to all users at the library and at selected remote sites to organizations and departments of the SADC Region. Bibliographic research and reference services are available to officials and scientists of the region.
The library is the National Aquatic Resources Centre for the Zimbabwe Agricultural Information Network (ZIMAGRINET), a computerised information network which collects, processes and disseminates information on agriculture and related subjects. Internet connection (e-mail plus a home page on www) facilitates access to external databases.
2.6.2 Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management, Harare
This Department of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism has the overall responsibility of promoting the conservation and wise utilization of wildlife resources (incl. fish) within the Parks and Wildlife Estate of the country. Its Aquatic Ecology Branch is primarily concerned with research on and management of fishery resources in major lakes and recreational fisheries as well as both basic and applied research aimed at fish seed production, stocking of small reservoirs, selective breeding and complementary feeding in support of aquaculture.
The library, created in 1963, is well organised. Its collections include about 4 000 monographs and nearly 15 000 reprints, all catalogued in a Procite database. Serials number about 400 (computerised list) of which about 105 are current, mostly obtained through exchanges and external funding. Emphasis of these collections is on terrestrial and aquatic ecology, with a smaller part referring to natural resources management, utilization and conservation as well as fisheries, aquaculture and sociology.
2.6.3 Ministry of Agriculture Central Library, Harare
This very old library created in 1915 coordinates information activities in the Ministry (six Branch libraries) as well as in parastatal agricultural libraries. It is a research library specialised in agriculture and related subjects. Its collections are extensive, including about 1500 serial titles (of which 262 current), 10 000 monographs and 15 000 reprints. Unfortunately, only the most recent acquisitions are catalogued in a computerised database (Micro CDS/ISIS) due to lack of staff.
At the national level, the library coordinates ZIMAGRINET. At the regional level, it is the focal point for the Southern African Agriculture Network (SAAINET) and member of the Southern African Interlending Scheme (SAIS). At the international level, it acts as input centre for the FAO-coordinated AGRIS/CARIS information network.
As part of its various services, the library offers a postal and telephone loan request service to all extension personnel and researchers in the field.
2.7 South Africa
2.7.1 Rhodes University and its main library, Grahamstown
Rhodes University, founded in 1904, has 37 academic Departments in seven Faculties. In 1996 there are almost 4 000 students of which about 15 percent come from outside the country. The University offers undergraduate courses and postgraduate degrees in all basic sciences. It also offers specializations of particular interest to this mission such as anthropology, computer science/networks, economics, ichthyology/fisheries science, information systems, management, sociology, community/rural development and conservation. Apart from the J.L.B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology (see Section 2.7.3), it hosts several other specialised research centres such as the Institute for Water Research (which maintains its own database) and the Institute of Social and Economic Research.
The main University library is housed in a four-storey building and functions with an annual budget of about one million USD. It offers all the facilities required to efficiently function as a large and modern university library, including a Local Area Network serving staff and students computers not only at the library itself but on the whole campus. The staff is well trained and highly competent, including 12 full-time professional librarians.
The collections are impressive. For our three areas of particular interest (anthropology, economics and sociology), there are 163 current serial titles, 80 theses and about 18 000 monographs. Major CD-ROM and on-line databases are available. The library catalogue is computerised using the URICA Library System. Acquisition and processing as well as system maintenance are centralised here. But collections dealing with specialised subjects (for ex. ichthyology, fisheries and aquaculture) are held in separate libraries and part of specific research institutes (for ex. J.L.B. Smith's, see Section 2.7.3). Access to the collections is free to the general public but access to commercial databases through the LAN is restricted to University staff, researchers and students.
2.7.2 R.U. Department of Ichthyology and Fisheries Science, Grahamstown
Established in 1981, Rhodes University Department of Ichthyology and Fisheries Science (DIFS) offers post graduate degrees (Diploma, BSc Honours, MSc and PhD levels) in the specialised fields of Ichthyology, Fisheries Science and Aquaculture. This year 40 students are enrolled of which 22 for a Masters and 13 for a Doctorate degree. A close collaboration exists with the J.L.B. Smith Institute for teaching, research and information (see Section 2.7.3). The chairman and the secretary/treasurer of the South African Aquaculture Association are Department staff and its newsletter is produced here.
Aquaculture research is currently focused on trout (nutrition/feeding), abalone (nutrition), marine food fishes (two sparids and spotted grunter) and ornamental fishes (freshwater and marine). In 1997, crab (Scylla spp.) will be added on the basis of existing Asian technology. In general, environmental requirements, genetics and the development of appropriate African culture techniques are priorities for any new species considered.
Staff and students heavily use the J.L.B. Smith Institute library and its database FISHLIT. The latter can be freely consulted on-line through the University Local Area Network (LAN), together with other databases such as NISC Water Resources Worldwide and African Studies as well as the main library catalogue (see Section 2.7.1).
A project financed by the Belgian Flemish Community has just started. It aims at producing interactive aquaculture courses on CD ROM, in collaboration with European Universities such as Ghent (Belgium) and Wageningen (Netherlands).
2.7.3 J.L.B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology, Grahamstown
Founded in 1948 as a Research Department of Rhodes University, this Institute became an independent Declared Cultural Institution in 1980. Its role is threefold: to curate the National Collection of Fishes, to conduct research in all aspects of ichthyology and to communicate knowledge on fishes and their environment to the scientific community and the lay public.
The fish collection includes more than 55 000 accessioned lots and over 750 000 specimens taken mainly from the surrounding oceans and fresh waters of southern Africa. It is catalogued as a comprehensive computerised database (FISHNET), supported by an extensive library and information service.
Research on fishes in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments has diversified in recent years. It now includes taxonomy, ecology, ethology, conservation, embryology, genetics, palaeontology, morphology and molecular biology. Contract research is also done on subsistence fisheries and environmental issues. Field guides, posters and scientific books are produced internally by full-time artists.
Institute staff collaborate very closely with the Rhodes University Department of Ichthyology and Fisheries Science for supervising and training postgraduate students. Short courses are organised on request on environmental education, taxonomy/systematics, and conservation and management procedures, followed up by on-site training.
The library is one of the few in the world devoted entirely to fish. Its collections consist of references on all aspects of fish, fisheries and aquaculture relevant to Africa and the surrounding oceans. They include more than 4 000 books, 25 000 reprints and 200 current serials. References older than 1985 are on a card catalogue. The rest is catalogued on the specialised database FISHLIT using the URICA Library System common to Rhodes University. By March 1995, FISHLIT contained 52 000 references.
Since June 1995, the Institute and Rhodes University have entered into an agreement with the South African branch of the National Inquiry Service Centre (NISC-SA) concerning FISHLIT: the rights to this database were purchased by NISC-SA in exchange for taking over prime responsibility for its production and for providing free copies of the full database on a quarterly basis to the Institute and Rhodes University. This database is also available on the NISC CD ROM Fish and Fisheries Worldwide, together with other aquatic science databases. FISHLIT should become available on-line via the Internet in the near future.
The Institute is actively preparing a symposium to be held in Grahamstown in September 1998 as a follow-up to the PARADI symposium (Biological Diversity of African Fresh- and Brackishwater Fishes, Senegal, November 1993). This scientific symposium will also aim at bringing people together and promoting information exchange.

3. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The criteria for the particular selection of libraries included in the survey are covered in section one. Our assessment of the existing information resources for aquatic farming systems is based upon site visits, detailed questionnaires and discussions with both library and research staff.
In most of the countries, there is a continuing loss of institutional memory due to the fast turnover of responsible personnel and frequent administrative reorganizations coupled with the absence of a central repository for technical reports on aquatic farming systems at national or sub-regional level; documentation of past research programmes and development project activities become rapidly inaccessible to most researchers and developers; it has even been observed that it may physically disappear from the country after a few years only.
The differences between the individual libraries, even within countries, are substantial in terms of facilities, collections and access to information. However, some general comparisons can be made between libraries in the geographical sub-regions and between the francophone and anglophone countries. Most notably is the advantageous position of those libraries in Eastern and Southern Africa in terms of:
* size of the current collection and availability of a budget in order to maintain acquisitions;
* library facilities and equipment;
* level of professional education and training of library staff;
* significant donor funding for information activities;
* within the sub-region there are substantially better library resources in South Africa and Zimbabwe, the only two countries with full Internet connectivity and access to external electronic information. Here also are the only libraries actually subscribing to current CD ROM databases.
Despite the relative disadvantages of those libraries in Western and Sahelian francophone Africa related to the above, there are many important information and documentation activities undertaken by all the libraries visited:
* active participation in, and in some cases coordination of, at least national but often regional or international information networks (see Annex 4);
* the organization, management and retrieval of information using PC based software. With the exception of South Africa, Micro CDS/ISIS is used in all the countries visited;
* the provision of information services to a broad user community, including external users, in the subject areas relevant to development and research in aquatic farming systems. In most cases the libraries have direct access to agricultural CD ROMs (mainly donor supplied) but even those libraries without CD ROMs are availing of search facilities at other institutions on behalf of users;
* participation in regional or international training programmes, for example in the use of Micro CDS/ISIS, often with donor support from FAO, BIEF, CTA, etc., and many are now involved in providing training.
In general, one can conclude that the differences in the physical facilities and budgets of the libraries are enormous, but that the types and level of activity and information services have many features in common. It is also a common experience that the libraries, even the wealthier ones, rely more and more on access to external information sources and on the sharing of resources. Budgetary constraints and the increasing amount of information sources available at ever increasing cost, particularly in a subject area with the breadth of aquatic farming systems, make it impossible for libraries to acquire all of the relevant publications necessary to satisfy user demand.
In addition to the economic burden of access to international and commercially available information, the lack of access to the results and findings of research between the different sub-regions and between the anglophone and francophone African countries is a major obstacle to development. The barrier separating the francophone and anglophone sub-regions results not only from linguistic problems but also from the distribution pattern of information resources. The research and development results/problems in one sub-region are therefore mostly ignored in the other one and ignorance of information older than 20 years in the other language is practically total in the young generation of researchers and developers.
Constraints on access to information within the region include:
* the development of aquaculture and aquatic farming systems in Africa is at a relatively early stage;
* the lack of information flow between institutions;
* research results of these institutions are mainly published as grey literature;
* they are not being collected and disseminated by readily available information systems, if at all.
Taking into account the above issues and:
* to support the priority research programmes identified during the follow-up of the SIFR (see Section 1), such as socio-economics, integrated aquaculture /animal husbandry, aquaculture integrated with irrigation schemes, fish production enhancement in small water bodies, and
* to serve future aquaculture development activities in general,
the Mission recommends the establishment of a regional network between those institutions with programmes and information resources relevant to aquatic farming systems
to improve access to information for the benefit of research and development throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
Without exception, there exists a great and genuine interest in the establishment of a specialised network promoting information exchange on research programmes/results and development projects/approaches related to aquaculture and all related aspects.
From past experience and discussions held during the mission, it is proposed that such an Information Network to be effective and sustainable:
* be based on existing institutions, as strong as possible;
* be built on existing networking experience;
* be geographically diversified, involving as many of the existing sub-regions as possible, both from language and agro-ecological points of view;
* provides its information services on an exchange basis as far as possible;
* actively promotes regular personal contacts between its staff members;
* be equipped with reliable, simple equipment, easily serviced locally;
* be able to rely on efficient communication facilities.
Based on these considerations, the Mission recommends that the Information Network be made of existing, geographically separated but closely linked, anglophone and francophone information centres. For the approach to information to be as multidisciplinary as necessary, the proposed network should address not only aquaculture technology but the production system as a whole. This involves all non-living and living components of the environment, including the producers themselves. Although fish production through small to medium scale freshwater aquaculture and the management of small water bodies should remain the central focus of the African information network, it would be essential to be able to access also information on rural sociology, agricultural economics, human nutrition and food security, water and soil conservation, rural extension methods/services, environmental impact, etc.
The Aquatic Farming Systems Information Network for Africa should therefore be initially composed of the libraries at:
* two coordinating Lead Centres, one in each linguistic sub-region as follows:
* francophone, at Institut des Savanes (IDESSA), in Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire;
* anglophone, at Bunda College of Agriculture, near Lilongwe, Malawi.
* eight Satellite Centres, three francophone and five anglophone as follows:
* in Côte d'Ivoire, at the Centre de Recherches Océanologiques, Abidjan, which should host the future RECOSCIX Project for West Africa;
* in Mali, at the Institut d'Economie Rurale, Bamako;
* for the Sahel, at the Institut du Sahel, in Bamako, Mali;
* in Nigeria, at Ibadan University;
* in Kenya, at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Mombasa, which hosts the RECOSCIX Project for Eastern coastal Africa and island states;
* in Zimbabwe, at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management;
* for the SADC region, at ALCOM Programme, in Harare, Zimbabwe;
* in South Africa, at the J.L.B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology, Grahamstown, in close collaboration with Rhodes University.
Such an Information Network has the following characteristics:
* it is bilingual English-French;
* it represents four of the five agro-ecological regions of sub-Saharan Africa;
* it is mostly based on regional and national institutions;
* it includes fresh-, brackish- and marine water expertise;
* it is primarily made of multidisciplinary libraries with an interest in aquaculture research/development and related subjects.
The network should strengthen national capacities in access to information, promote regional cooperation and complement existing national and international information networks.
The main objectives of the network should be to:
* stimulate the collection and organization of information relevant to aquatic farming systems at sub-regional level;
* improve access to and dissemination of existing information resources;
* harmonize the tools and methodologies for sharing this information throughout the region;
* train and share the expertise of professional staff by means of courses, workshops, meetings, bulletins;
* ensure that the results and findings of research and development activities are incorporated into international as well as regional information systems;
* ensure that repositories of relevant publications are available in the sub-regions;
* produce bibliographic outputs which will benefit users in the whole region.
The guiding principles for the operation of the network should include:
* participation means partnership in technical decisions, in adapting the network to changing technology and evolving needs, and in sharing the wealth of data gathered;
* duplication of the work done for existing national or regional networks should be avoided;
* complementing existing national, regional and international networks for the benefit of research and development in aquatic farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
The network should also at some stage seek to establish relationships with other organizations and institutions:
* with specialized information resources relevant to aquatic farming systems, such as those of Infopeche and SADC/IFC;
* in developed countries who are willing to provide information to the region. As has been shown by RECOSCIX-WIO this type of cooperation is much more effective when coordinated at the regional level;
* in Asia where there is more expertise in aquatic farming systems and substantial information resources relevant to Africa.
Most of the libraries visited have access to electronic mail facilities, although many of them experience difficulties or are connected via another facility e.g., CRO via ORSTOM; KMFRI via Belgium. With the exception of South Africa and Zimbabwe, none of the libraries is yet connected to the Internet, although there is a lot of donor activity in the region to facilitate or improve access e.g., INSAH expects to be connected in 1997; Bunda College is investigating satellite connection. It is not easy to predict when all of the libraries will be able to avail of electronic communication facilities but there is no doubt that they will play an increasingly important role and will have an enormous impact on their ability to share information resources.
It is important that the network not only shares the expertise gained by its members in this area but also that it is proactive in taking advantage of the many developments and new initiatives at a regional level. For example the Secretary General of the United Nations has charged ECA/PADIS with the management of a task force under the Special Initiative on "harnessing information technology for development." In partnership with the entire United Nations system, but especially with the World Bank and UNESCO, ECA will raise funds for and implement a programme working in the following areas:
* securing the necessary policy reform for African participation in the information age
* setting up infrastructure for full Internet connectivity in selected countries
* building capacities for computer networking in Africa through training at national and regional levels
* building capacities in Africa to use knowledge for development decision making and sector applications
* utilization of local resources and established information base
* encouragement of South-South co-operation.
Technical and financial assistance are required to initially strengthen the proposed francophone coordination center and to initiate regional networking activities on aquatic farming systems information in sub-Saharan Africa. The mission recommends that such assistance be provided by FAO under its Technical Cooperation Programme as outlined in Annex 5.

ANNEX 4
Participation in Existing Networks
In order to take maximum advantage of existing networks and the networking experience of the libraries visited a brief resume follows of those information networks in which the libraries are currently involved. A regional cooperation network between aquatic farming systems information centres in Africa should not involve a duplication of effort or competition with existing information networks. The aim should be to improve access to information by means of cooperation and to complement or strengthen existing networks.
Where constraints and strengths of the different networks are mentioned, these apply only within the context of the needs of an aquatic farming systems information network. The only partners listed are those visited by the mission.
1. AGRIS : International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology
Coordinated by FAO Library and Documentation Systems Division and currently 150 countries, 16 international and 10 regional centres participate. Input is mainly prepared using the Micro CDS/ISIS software and the AGRIN package is supplied by FAO to facilitate this.
Strengths:
Multilingual database with coverage of the broad subject areas relevant to aquatic farming systems. Input centres in all countries visited. Wide dissemination of the whole database.
African Partners include:
Cote d'Ivoire : Via REDACI - CRO; IDESSA.
Mali: IER ; REMADOC
Malawi: Bunda College of Agriculture. (In cooperation with Chitedze)
Zimbabwe: Ministry of Agriculture Central Library ;Via ZIMAGRINET - ALCOM, DNPWM
2. ASFA : Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts
Coordinated by FAO Fisheries Department and involving 6 other international organizations and 23 national partners. Input has recently gone over to a Micro CDS/ISIS package known as ASFISIS which is distributed by FAO.
Constraints:
So far in english only. One input centre in Africa. Database not widely distributed in Africa.
Strengths:
Most comprehensive coverage of aquaculture literature internationally, including African aquaculture.
African Partners include:
Kenya - KMFRI / RECOSCIX-WIO
3. IAMSLIC : International Association of Marine and Aquatic Science Libraries and Information Centers, Africa Regional Group
The association provides a forum for the exchange of experience and expertise via annual international meetings, regional meetings, a Newsletter, electronic bulletin board and the Worl Wide Web. It has as one of its objectives to promote cooperation and sharing of resources among libraries and information centers which specialize in any aspect of aquatic science --freshwater, brackish and marine. The Africa Regional Group has 32 members in 15 countries and the Chair is currently at CRODT, Senegal.
Partners include:
Cote d'Ivoire : CRO
Kenya : KMFRI, RECOSCIX
Zimbabwe : ALCOM
4. PADIS : Pan African Development Information System
Activities include assistance to African member states and institutions to build their capacity in the management of information services and systems. Training is provided in the use of Micro CDS/ISIS software and PADIS methodologies. A sub-regional centre in Zambia coordinates ESADIS, the Eastern and Southern Africa Development Information System.
Partners include:
Mali : INSAH
5. RECOSCIX - CEA : Regional Cooperation in Scientific Information Exchange in the Central Eastern Atlantic
During the 3rd Session of the IOC Regional Committee for the Central Eastern Atlantic, Dakar, Senegal, January 1993, the Delegate of Cote d'Ivoire introduced the RECOSCIX-CEA project proposal. This involved a pilot phase of two years with the objective to establish the regional network, its services and products, based along the lines of the RECOSCIX-WIO network. The Regional Committee endorsed the project for the initial pilot phase which was launched in April 1993 at CRO, Abidjan, and ran until May 1995. During this phase the necessary office space, staff and computer equipment for the regional despatch centre were allocated. Micro CDS/ISIS software and the ASFA CD ROM were installed and training provided.
Constraints:
Lack of funding has not enabled the network to progress beyond the initial pilot phase. The existing level of cooperation between the libraries in the region which were identified as participants appears to be minimal. CRO is under the impression that IOC is trying to locate a donor and that until one is found they are not in a position to further the aims of the network.
African Partners include:
Cote d'Ivoire : CRO, IDESSA
6. RECOSCIX - WIO : Regional Cooperation in Scientific Information Exchange in the Western Indian Ocean Region
The network is fully described in the mission report. This IOC/UNESCO Project funded by Belgium since 1991 and implemented in collaboration with KMFRI by the Limburg University Centre operates jointly with the above library. There are 61 co-operating institutions and 23 co-operating libraries. Member countries are Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia and Tanzania.
During the actual second phase of the project (1996-99),the focus will be on library services and on services in data management, in particular the distribution of mass data using CD-ROM technology. In 1995 KMFRI/ RECOSCIX-WIO became a regional input centre for the ASFA database.
Constraints:
The activities of the network and most of the RECOSCIX staff are totally dependent on external funding and the sustainability of the network without this is a recurring worry. The fact that the onus for collecting publications, creating the databases and despatching requests or documents all rests with KMFRI has not resulted in a network based on true partnership.
Strengths:
A high profile has given RECOSCIX-WIO good intra- and inter-regional contacts which assisted KMFRI in building up a good library which acts as an information resource for the region. The involvement of collaborating libraries in North America, Europe and Asia allows RECOSCIX to fulfil many of the requests for documents without cost, as well as attracting donations of publications from many libraries.
Partners include:
Kenya : KMFRI, RECOSCIX.
7. REDACI : Reseau National de Documentation Agricole en Cote d'Ivoire
Created in 1986 the network now comprises 32 partners representing a large majority of the agricultural sector institutions in Cote d'Ivoire. The main output of the network is the REDACI database, which currently contains about 11,000 records. Other output products include a union list of periodicals ; general or specialised bibliographies ; extracts from the SESAME and TROPAG CD ROMs ; a directory of the resources of agricultural documentation in Cote d'Ivoire. Donor support has been provided in the form of a microcomputer through the CTA CD ROM program.
Constraints:
Lack of funding means that the network is totally dependent upon the cooperation and enthusiasm of members and the ability and willingness of their parent institutions to finance travel to meetings and development of the network. Recent economic difficulties in Cote d'Ivoire have resulted in the the loss of seven REDACI partners due to the merging or closing of government institutions. Lack of direct access to the whole database for all of the partner institutions is a disadvantage.
Strengths:
Very clear objectives which benefit all of the participating institutions and serve the agricultural sector as a whole.
Partners include:
CRO ; IDESSA
8. REMADOC: Reseau Malien d'Information et de Documentation Scientifiques et Techniques
This national network of all research institutions in the agricultural sector is coordinated by IER. Records are supplied to a central Micro CD/ISIS database using the BABINAT format.
Partners include:
IER ; Division Peche et Pisciculture
9. RESADOC: Reseau Sahelien d'Information et de Documentation Scientifiques et Techniques
The network is fully described in the Mission Report. The RESADOC network, which started its activities in 1979, covers twenty broad subject areas and provides a regional resource of information and documentation related to the Sahel. National documentation centres nominated by CILSS in Mauritania, Chad, Cape Verde, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali, Niger and Guinea Bissau have the responsibility to collect relevant publications and provide catalogue records to INSAH, which then incorporates them into RESADOC. The database contains over 22,000 records, of which only about 1% relate to fisheries or aquaculture. Outputs from the database include the annual RESINDEX and specialised bibliographies. RESADOC has been maintained up to now using MINISIS software but INSAH has recently converted to Micro CDS/ISIS, with some difficulties. An evaluation of RESADOC by IDRC in 1995 resulted in a decision by CILSS to restructure and revitalize the network. The information programme at INSAH
has been re-structured in the new Sahelian Communication Project (PROSACOM). The staff of national centres are meeting at INSAH in November 1996 to review the methodologies used and to address the needs of the input centres in the light of technological developments. RESADOC has also in the past cooperated with AGRIS, although the problems of compatibility between the systems continues. Much of the content of RESADOC is outside of the scope of AGRIS and it is considered to be more relevant and targetted towards the information needs of the CILSS members.
Constraints:
The different languages of the Sahelian countries, as well as institutional problems at the national input centres, have always posed problems for RESADOC. The fact that much of the work was centralised at one institution has led to an imbalance in the decision-making processes, with the national centres not having the status of true partners. Technological developments have overtaken developments of network activities.
Strengths:
The recent review and ongoing re-structuring of the network should rectify some of the above problems. RESADOC serves a poor, also in information resources, region of Africa. It provides a regional information resource, targetted to the specific needs of the Sahel.
Partners include
: Mali: INSAH ; IER
10. SAAINET: Southern African Agricultural Information Network
The network was initiated at a meeting sponsored by the the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research and Training (SACCAR) in July 1995. The objective of the meeting was to explore ways by which efficient and sustainable agricultural documentation and information networks could be established in the Southern African Development Community region, taking into account the diversity of national agricultural and documentation information situations.

1. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
1.1 Background
In Africa, sub-Saharan aquaculture is still little developed and contributes only 0.2 percent of world production. But nevertheless its production has been steadily increasing, for example from about 9 000 t in 1984 to about 40 000 t in 1994, an average annual growth rate of 16 percent. The estimated monetary value of this production now reaches about USD 75 million to which should be added unaccounted but important nutritional and sociological benefits.
Together with the 12 countries responsible for 90 percent of aquaculture production in sub-Saharan Africa (excl. South Africa), a recent FAO/ECA/EU study has identified the main constraints to aquaculture development (CIFA Tech. Rep. 23, 1994). By matching these constraints with identified aquaculture development priorities and research priorities through a logical process, they could be classified into four broad development priority areas, one of them being Aquaculture Information.
Eight regional research programmes were then designed to meet the identified aquaculture development priorities in each of these priority areas, most of them being formulated at the regional level to address constraints within and among the five sub-Saharan agro-ecological regions. A ninth programme, Information, was formulated to guide and support these regional research networks which need to have direct access to past and present development/research data. It was proposed that an improved information flow throughout Africa be facilitated at least in its two main official languages, English and French.
It was felt that an Information Network made of geographically separated but closely linked anglophone and francophone information centres would be more effective at collecting, storing and disseminating relevant information, both on a sub-regional and regional basis. From past experience, it is known that for such an Information Network to be effective and sustainable it should:
* be based on existing institutions, with the required capabilities;
* be built on existing networking experience;
* be geographically diversified, involving as many of the existing sub-regions as possible, both from language and agro-ecological points of view;
* provide its information services as far as possible on an exchange basis;
* actively promote regular personal contacts between its staff members;
* be equipped with reliable, simple equipment, easily serviced locally;
* be able to rely on efficient communication facilities.
If the purpose of such an Information Network is to support the identified research programmes (e.g socio-economics, integrated aquaculture/animal husbandry, aquaculture integrated with irrigation schemes, fish production enhancement in small water bodies) and to serve aquaculture development activities in general, the approach to information needs should be multidisciplinary. It should address not only aquaculture technology but the production system as a whole. This involves all non-living and living components of the environment, including the producers themselves. Although fish production through small to medium scale freshwater aquaculture and the management of small water bodies should remain the central focus of the African information network, it would be essential to be able to access also information on rural sociology, agricultural economics, human nutrition and food security, water and soil conservation, rural extension methods/services, environmental impact,
etc.
1.2 Justification
The diversity of institutions and the range of research programmes which they cover is indicative of the multidisciplinary nature of aquatic farming systems itself, ranging from the more technical aspects of aquaculture (i.e. fish production) to the sociological, environmental and economic aspects of rural development and the communities involved in the activity. It is also indicative of the level of activity in freshwater aquaculture development and research in the region compared with other regions. There are, for example, no institutions which have aquaculture as a primary programme and it is normally one component among many other programmes for food production and rural development.
However, the increasingly important contribution of aquaculture to food security is reflected in an expansion of training, research and extension activities at national level. One of the constraints to effective research at national level has been identified, by SIFR and CIFA amongst others, as the lack of access to relevant information.
In most of the countries, there is a continuing loss of institutional memory due to the fast turnover of responsible personnel and frequent administrative reorganizations coupled with the absence of a central repository for technical reports on aquatic farming systems at national or sub-regional level; documentation of past research programmes and development project activities becomes rapidly inaccessible to most researchers and developers; it has even been observed that it may physically disappear from the country after a few years only.
The differences between the individual libraries, even within countries, are substantial in terms of facilities, collections and access to information. However, some general comparisons can be made between libraries in the geographical sub-regions and between the francophone and anglophone countries. Most notably is the advantageous position of those libraries in Eastern and Southern Africa in terms of:
* size of the current collection and availability of a budget in order to maintain acquisitions;
* library facilities and equipment;
* level of professional education and training of library staff;
* significant donor funding for information activities;
* within the sub-region there are substantially better library resources in South Africa and Zimbabwe, the only two countries with full Internet connectivity and access to external electronic information. Here also are the only libraries actually subscribing to current CD ROM databases.
Despite the relative disadvantages of those libraries in Western and Sahelian francophone Africa related to the above, there are many important information and documentation activities undertaken by all libraries:
* active participation in, and in some cases coordination of, at least national but often regional or international information networks;
* the organization, management and retrieval of information using PC based software. With the exception of South Africa, Micro CDS/ISIS is used in all the countries visited;
* the provision of information services to a broad user community, including external users, in the subject areas relevant to development and research in aquatic farming systems. In most cases the libraries have direct access to agricultural CD ROMs (mainly donor supplied) but even those libraries without CD ROMs are availing of search facilities at other institutions on behalf of users;
* participation in regional or international training programmes, for example in the use of Micro CDS/ISIS, often with donor support from FAO, BIEF, CTA etc., and many are now involved in providing training.
In general, one can conclude that the differences in the physical facilities and budgets of the libraries are enormous, but that the types and level of activity and information services have many features in common. It is also a common experience that the libraries, even the wealthier ones, rely more and more on access to external information sources and on the sharing of resources. Budgetary constraints and the increasing amount of information sources available at ever increasing cost, particularly in a subject area with the breadth of aquatic farming systems, make it impossible for libraries to acquire all of the relevant publications necessary to satisfy user demand.
In addition to the economic burden of access to international and commercially available information, the lack of access to the results and findings of research between the different sub-regions and between the anglophone and francophone African countries is a major obstacle to development. The barrier separating the francophone and anglophone sub-regions results not only from linguistic problems but also from the distribution pattern of information resources. The research and development results/problems in one sub-region are therefore mostly ignored in the other one and ignorance of information older than 20 years in the other language is practically total in the young generation of researchers and developers.
With regards to the disappearance of information from national libraries, a network of libraries could be effective in repatriating missing publications.
These constraints can be summarized as:
* the development of aquaculture and aquatic farming systems in Africa is at a relatively early stage;
* there is limited or no flow of information between institutions;
* the research results of these institutions are mainly published as grey literature;
* they are not being collected and disseminated by readily available information systems, if at all.
2. OBJECTIVES AND OUTPUTS
2.1 Objectives
The main objectives for an information network between institutions with programmes in aquatic farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa would be to support research and development activities by:
* improving access to aquatic farming systems information resources in sub-Saharan Africa;
* developing mechanisms for information resource sharing between the institutions involved and particularly to encourage links between the different sub-regions and between the francophone and anglophone countries;
* ensuring that the findings and results of aquatic farming systems programmes in sub-Saharan Africa are disseminated widely, both in the region and also to the international community.
Organization at the regional level would provide a more cost effective means of collecting, managing and disseminating information. The network would also strengthen national capacities in access to information, promote regional cooperation and complement existing national and international information networks.
The immediate objectives of the African network would be:
* stimulated collection and organization of information relevant to aquatic farming systems at sub-regional level;
* improved access to and dissemination of existing information resources and improved document delivery;
* harmonization of the tools and methodologies for sharing this information throughout the region;
* human resources development by means of courses, workshops, meetings, bulletins;
* incorporation of the findings of research and development activities in international as well as regional information systems;
* promotion of repositories of publications from within sub-regions;
* production of bibliographic outputs which will benefit users in the whole region.
The guiding principles for the operation of the network should include:
* participation means partnership in technical decisions, in adapting the network to changing technology and evolving needs, and in sharing the wealth of data gathered;
* duplication of the work done for existing national or regional networks should be avoided;
* complementing existing national, regional and international networks for the benefit of research and development in aquatic farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
The immediate objectives of the project would be the establishment and initial operation of the network with the above-mentioned immediate objectives and guiding principles.
2.2 Outputs
The primary beneficiaries of the network would be the broad spectrum of users of the network libraries i.e. researchers, students and staff at the institutions; development agencies, including governmental and non-governmental; policy and planning officers; training and extension workers, the private sector and the international community via organizations such as ECA, UNDP, EU, ICLARM, FAO.
The network would aim to guide users to appropriate sources of information and provide targetted and timely services, responsive to user feedback.
Specific details of the outputs of the network will be agreed by the participants but some important information gaps have already been identified as well as material suitable for information exchange purposes.
The expected outputs of the network would be:
* a union catalogue of periodicals relevant to aquatic farming systems, with details of holdings in the region;
* a Directory of information resources on aquatic farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
* repositories of national/regional documents would be maintained in the sub-regions;
* specialized bibliographies as published products or in response to requests;
* exchange of products such as own publications, new acquisitions bulletins, contents pages of journals, extracts from CD ROM databases;
* exchange of information on new research projects, developments in technology and Internet access.
The expected project outputs would be:
* information network on aquatic farming systems established;
* two workshops, one for the constitution of the network and the organization of its initial operation and the second for review of project achievements and discussion of future development;
* training of project coordinator, support personnel at IDESSA and nine professional librarians at participating libraries;
* bibliographic outputs for the region:
+ Union Catalogue of Serials;
+ Directory on Information Resources on research and development activities;
* Constitution of the Network Document;
* Network News Bulletin;
* links with regional and international information networks and with CIFA;
* proposals for future development.
3. WORK PLAN AND ACTIVITIES

The Aquatic Farming Systems Information Network for Africa (AFSINA) will initially be composed of libraries at:
* two coordinating Lead Centres, one in each linguistic sub-region as follows:
· francophone, at Institut des Savanes (IDESSA), in Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire;
· anglophone, at Bunda College of Agriculture, near Lilongwe, Malawi.
* eight Satellite Centres, three francophone and five anglophone as follows:
· in Côte d'Ivoire, at Centre de Recherches Océanologiques, Abidjan, which should host the future RECOSCIX Project for West Africa;
· in Mali, at Institut d'Economie Rurale, Bamako;
· for the Sahel, at Institut du Sahel, in Bamako, Mali;
· in Nigeria, at Ibadan University, Faculty of Agriculture/Forestry;
· in Kenya, at Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Mombasa which hosts the RECOSCIX Project for Eastern coastal Africa and island states;

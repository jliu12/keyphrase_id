The major challenge in projecting wood and fibre supplies is to estimate the future availability of tree and forest resources that will continue to be used for production and to calculate the volume of roundwood that might be produced from such areas. A basic input for any projection is the area of production forests and forest plantations. Unfortunately, comprehensive forest inventory information of national forest plantation resources, particularly those owned by the private sector is generally scarce. Available figures are often weak and unreliable and improving the underlying statistics requires continuous efforts. Developing new and refining existing data collection frameworks remain a priority. The question as to what role forest plantations might play in meeting the future demand for forest products is linked closely to past, current and future patterns in forest plantation development. As most projections can only rely on provisional or indicative data, tentative analyses and ballpark figures or guesstimates are common. There are numerous reasons for this shortcoming. One is that most forest departments concentrate their efforts on collecting data and presenting information on public sector plantations only. Until recently, this approach was justified. However, a global shift towards privatization has led to increasing investments in plantation development by the private sector. In relative terms the plantation areas administered and managed by the public sector ­ the state forest department in the case of Peninsular Malaysia ­ are shrinking, although in many countries the public sector continues to dominate the plantation sector. In Peninsular Malaysia, it is expected that the private sector will play a more important role in the development of plantations. The government encourages private sector involvement and promotes the privatization of its own plantations. While demand is increasing and the commercial sector is also increasingly interested in forest plantation development to secure raw materials for its processing plants, there is no information on the status of the spatial extent and quality of private plantations in Peninsular Malaysia. As a case study of the involvement of the private sector in Peninsular Malaysia, this study will assess the status of private forest plantations.
Approach and methodology.
For this study a thorough survey approach was adopted to prepare a database on private sector forest plantations. In Peninsular Malaysia, such a study is possible within a few months because the nation is small compared to countries such as India or China. The total land area in Peninsular Malaysia is 13 million ha. About six million ha constitute natural forests with protection and production functions. Forest plantations are located in the non-forest areas. As Peninsular Malaysia is divided into 11 states, a state-wise survey approach therefore seemed logical. Using this approach, the survey was carried out via visits to each state where data were recorded in the field. This ensured that the extent of forest plantations could be documented accurately. Initially, the relevant data to be collected were identified. A uniform data collection sheet was developed (Appendix 1) that detailed data on location, species planted, spatial extent, planting system employed and ownership, cultural practices, reason for planting timber species and plantation terrain. Each state was combed systematically and all the existing forest plantations, established by small- and large-scale investors, were documented. Most of the information was obtained through interviews with representatives of relevant companies, farmers and state authorities. To facilitate and accelerate data collection, individual state forest departments and agricultural departments and the various agencies involved were informed in writing of the study objectives and asked to assist the data collecting team during the field work. Before visiting the field, several meetings were held with these departments and other agencies such as the Federal Land.
Development Authority (FELDA) and the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) to refine the survey design. Where possible, the departments were asked to appoint one officer to assist the team. Time permitting, the field officers were also asked to start data collection before the team arrived. Similar requests were also sent to FELDA and RISDA who have land banks with the potential for forest plantation development. Following this notification, the data collection team ­ consisting of seven members ­ was briefed on the survey procedures. A survey plan was prepared and the team was divided into three groups, each comprising one assistant research officer and one research assistant. Several states were allotted to each of the groups. To ensure the team had understood the nature of the task, the survey was tested in the state of Selangor. After adjusting the survey forms (see Appendix 1), the three groups visited the respective states, and the survey was completed in four months (Table 1). Teams had approximately one month for each state. In each state they met with the state forestry officer assigned to the study. The team visited various state agencies and district offices to locate areas assigned or planted with forest plantations before interviewing plantation owners during the field visits.

Data analysis.
The data were analysed at the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). Some background information on current plantation status was first collated from the records available at FRIM and Forest Department, Peninsular Malaysia. This included: Records of plantations established between 1915 and 1982 and their locations; Updated information on Acacia mangium plantations; and Reference to previous records of plantations to verify the new data collected. Next, the data collected during the survey were keyed into Excel spreadsheets for each state. Summaries were then generated for the whole of Peninsular Malaysia. All information presented in this report was derived from the data analysis.
Survey cost.
Costs included the wages of the field officers and the assistant research officers (AROs) for a period of four months. The monthly wages of each accompanying state officer were also taken into account for a period of one month per officer. Lodging and food expenses for each ARO amounted to RM100 per day. For the assistants the rate was RM60 per day. Vehicle rental came to RM150 per day, which included fuel costs and the daily wage of the driver. As this was the first survey of its kind the costs for each hectare of plantation surveyed were quite high. However, if the total non-forest area is considered, the costs are fairly low (Table 2).

Experience gained.
If the land area of a particular country is small, it may be possible to carry out the initial ground survey to develop the first database with few errors and relatively quickly. Once the database is established, data sheets of the existing plantations can be distributed to the respective state forestry office. Providing additional data sheets allows for regular updates in each state. In this way, the state forestry offices can then be charged to furnish updated information on private plantations at the end of each year to the central agency, which is responsible for updating the main database. In large countries such as India and China and when funds are limited, it may not be feasible for a single agency to conduct a ground survey as this would be time consuming and costly. In such cases, a standard format for data collection has to be developed. This facilitates the consolidation of data collected by different agencies in an effective and accurate way. In each state, province or district an officer ­ probably from the forestry department ­ should be appointed to carry out the survey and to manage the collected data. The data can then be transmitted to a single agency that can then build up a database. Following the survey carried out in Peninsular Malaysia during this study, it is proposed that the state forestry departments take the responsibility to update the database on an annual basis. Related activities will become part of their daily duties, which would reduce costs substantially. Guidelines for cost-effective data collection and database development.
Identify a central agency or unit responsible for data collection and database maintenance.
The agency should prepare a standard survey form for data collection incorporating all the required details for supporting the private sector in plantation development and for predicting future wood supplies.
The agency should request the appointment of state, provincial or district officers who are tasked with conducting the survey.
Appointed officers are trained on data collection in the field during a pre-test.
Subsequently, appointed officers carry out the surveys. The first survey will be intensive to capture all available data on forest plantations.
All costs incurred by the officers will have to be borne by the respective state, provincial or district office.
The appointed officers are responsible for preparing the data before they are sent to the central agency for consolidation into a single database; they are then keyed into the central database.
Records need to be updated on an annual or biannual basis.
Status of forest plantations Introduction.
The total hectarage of forest plantations in the country is shown in Appendix.
This section (a) discusses the distribution of private forest plantations by state, (b) traces species inter-cropping, (c) traces the types of planting designs adopted and (d) highlights a few case studies on commercial tree planting by private investors.
Year of forest plantation establishment, distribution and species choice.
According to information released by the Forest Department, Peninsular Malaysia, forest plantations covered 74 022 ha in 2000. The data obtained by the survey conducted under this study indicate a slightly higher area of 75 672 ha for 2001. More than 15 000 ha were planted in 1988 and more than 10 000 ha in 1985, which is 20 and 15 percent of the total plantation areas, respectively. Most of the plantations were established during the first phase of the Compensatory Forest Plantation Programme between 1982 and 1988. Since 1989, annual planting rates have not exceeded 7 000 ha.

The figures in Table 3 and Figure 1 indicate that interest in planting forest species has changed over the years. Interest tended to increase whenever there was a campaign to plant trees and slowed down thereafter. The planting of sentang and teak increased immediately after FRIM organized a road show on the two species in 1996 and 1997. Planting rates declined the following year. In addition, planting rates were affected by the financial crisis that has slowed down economic growth across Southeast Asia since late 1997. The economic as well as political impacts of the crisis most likely explain the dramatic drop in planting rates since 1998. The role that individual planters played in forest plantation development was as important as that of private companies (Table 4). For example, the total area planted by individuals until the end of 2001 was 11 823 ha (15.6 percent), whereas the area planted by companies was 11 404 ha (15.1 percent). What distinguishes the two private sector groups is the area planted individually,.
which usually is much larger for a company than for individual planters. Johore, Pahang and Terengganu account for the largest area under forest plantations with more than 6 000 ha, 2 000 ha and 1 000 ha planted, respectively (Table 4).

Besides area planted, another important variable for assessing the wood supply and market potential of plantations is species distribution. In Peninsular Malaysia, the species preferred by all planters is obviously Acacia mangium. For example, of the 6 600 ha established in Johore, 6 470 ha were planted with Acacia mangium, whereas another 38 ha, 54 ha and 2 ha were planted with teak (Tectona grandis), sentang (Azadirachta excelsa), and sentang and rubber, respectively (Appendix 2). Of the 64 348 ha planted with Acacia mangium, 8 554 have been planted by private companies, 49 919 ha by government agencies and 5 875 ha by individual planters (Table 5). Sentang and teak plantations cover an area of 3 676 ha and 3 107 ha, respectively (Table 6). With regard to other species (e.g. Khaya spp. and Araucaria spp.), the total area planted is too small to have an effect on the international timber market. The volume to be produced will be too small to effectively create a market for the species. It is probably also not economic to extract small quantities of timber because of the high logging and transport costs.

About 30 percent of the plantations are located in Pahang (Table 6). Other states with considerable areas under forest plantations include Johore (20 688 ha), Selangor (10 161 ha), N. Sembilan (5 590 ha) and Terengganu (5 168 ha). The planting of forest species such as teak and sentang together with agricultural crops (e.g. rubber or oil palm) is low. For instance, the area inter-cropped with sentang and rubber totalled only 900 ha for all of Peninsular Malaysia. There is even less interest in inter-cropping with oil palm, durian, teak and other species.

Timber production from forest plantations.
A discussion on the development of forest plantations would be incomplete without considering the production of timber derived from the plantations. According to official statistics (Table 7), forest plantations were able to produce timber only on two occasions, namely in 1997 (35 030 m3) and 1998 (26 556 m3) (Forestry Department, Peninsular Malaysia 2001). There is no information on species and the destination of logs for further processing. Assuming a 15-year rotation, the total documented production probably consisted of Acacia mangium only, which was planted as early as 1985. Trees planted in 1988 have not been felled, as they are only between 12 and 13 years old. Even fast-growing species such as Acacia mangium will not be logged before 2004. Slower-growing species such as sentang and teak will not be logged before 2008 (Ahmad Zuhaidi et al. 1997) and the volumes obtained in the first years of logging can be assumed to be quite low. Hence, with.
regard to wood production forest plantations will continue to play an insignificant role compared to production from natural forests in the foreseeable future.

Planting design.
To date, forest plantations consist of single species or are mixed with agricultural crops, such as rubber and oil palm. In some cases forest species are planted as perimeter crops rather than as the main crop. Forest species usually are planted as perimeter crops on land that is either too steep ­ to reduce soil erosion and prevent landslips ­ or not fertile enough for agricultural crops. Examples of forest species planted as monocrops include Acacia mangium, teak, Khaya sp. and sentang. Species planted as mixed and perimeter crops include rubber, sentang, teak and oil palm. The planting design is related closely to the arrangement of the crops planted. It can be triangular or square. The tree arrangement and the distances between trees depend on terrain characteristics and soil type. The recommended spacing for sentang, if planted as a monocrop, is 4 x 3 m (Figure 2), and as a hedge or perimeter it is 3 x 3 m (Figure 3).

If sentang is planted as a monocrop, the common spacing in addition to 3 x 3 m and 3 x 4 m is 2 x 2 m, 3 x 8 m (Tables 8 and 9). A planting distance of 2 x 2 m is not recommended, as the ratio between height and stem diameter for a sentang tree is usually more than one. Trees that have a height-to-diameter ratio of one are usually more stable and are not blown down easily by strong winds (Ahmad Zuhaidi et al. 1997).

Case studies.
A private company The first case study involves a respondent from the southern state of the peninsula. He was optimistic about forest plantations. Originally, the respondent planted Maesopsis eminii on 96 ha. His optimism has encouraged his company to extend the plantation area with the same species.
For plantation related activities the company employs about seven management staff and five contract workers. The main plantation management objective is income generation. The company has faced various challenges, such as shortage of land and labour, and uncertainty of the market price for the final product, i.e. logs. To ensure profitability, the trees will be cut when they are 10 years old. Maesopsis eminii was chosen because it is fast growing and exhibits a uniform growth. This means that the rotations can be short and the final crop volume is more predictable than other species. The planting distance chosen for Maesopsis eminii was 4 x 4 m. Measurements taken during the field visit indicated that the average diameter was 15.4 cm and the average height was 8.1 m. The largest diameter recorded was 20.5 cm. Trees were about three years old. The excellent growth performance is probably because the area used to be a fruit orchard. The gentle slope of between six and 15 percent, together with a sandy-loamy soil type also makes the site suitable for tree planting. Nitrogen phosphate (nitrophoska) 15-15-15 and Sunbear 12-12-17 fertilizers were applied several times. Ease of application, low price and availability in the market were reasons for selecting these two fertilizers. Roundup Transorb was used as a herbicide. Weeding, climber cutting and fertilizer application were carried out during the first several years after tree planting (i.e. between year 1 and year 4). These activities are crucial for seedlings to establish a root system and adapt to the new environment. The excellent growth noted also indicates that managing the planted species from seedlings promises a better output at the end of the planting period. Individual planters Individual planters are persons who plant trees on a small piece of land (0.4 ha or less). Usually, these so-called forest plantations are located close to the owners' homes and management is on a part-time basis. However, some individual planters are fully occupied by forest plantation activities. For such planters, the growth performance of their trees has been encouraging. The two respondents selected for the case study came from Johore. Both had chosen teak as the main species. They owned forest plantations of 4 ha and 8 ha, respectively. Most tasks are performed by the respondents themselves. The first respondent indicated that he needed at least one day per month to take care of the plantation, while the second respondent (the planter with slightly more than 8 ha) spends approximately five days per month looking after his plantation. Similar to other private planters, the main objective of these respondents in tree planting was to generate additional income. They did not view shortage of land, marketing of final products, procurement of seedlings, species selection, planting skills and other related issues as problems; limited land availability may constrain extension of the plantations. The respondent with the 4 ha plot that was planted in 1995 reported that the average height and stem diameters were 16 m and 16 cm, respectively. The second planter indicated a similar average height of 16 m and a slightly lower average diameter of 13 cm. This slightly lower average diameter is to be expected because the trees were one year younger. The planting distances of the respondents with 4 and 8 ha plots were 3 x 2.4 m and 3.8 x 2.5 m, respectively. Although they lacked a detailed understanding of potential planting designs, both planters thought that the selected spacing was the most suitable for their teak. Both respondents stated that their areas were originally rubber plantations on Class I soil. Both plantations were located on terrain with between 0 and 5 percent slope, and an altitude below 100 m. The type of soil for both project areas was clay. It was also observed that both respondents used chicken manure as fertilizer, which was cheap and readily available. Both respondents declared that they had to apply fertilizer two to three times per year to boost the growth of the teak trees. Most planters interviewed had some ideas of the market for and end-uses of the species planted. For instance, teak can be used for interior finishing, panels, high-class furniture and fancy plywood, whereas sentang can be used for joinery, interior finishing and sliced veneer. The majority of the planters also expected that species such as sentang would penetrate the international market if the quantity produced was sufficient to make an impact.
Conclusions.
The database developed from the survey results provides information on not only the various agencies involved in the development of forest plantations by state but also the species planted and the age of plantations. Private forest plantations in Peninsular Malaysia are small and widely scattered. The size of the existing forest plantations is not large enough to significantly reduce the pressure on the natural forest. Plantation development in Peninsular Malaysia needs to be supported by incentives and a planting campaign. Socio-economic and biophysical aspects of private forest plantations.
Introduction.
Socio-economic and biophysical aspects of forest plantations established by private companies and individual planters cover basic information on: type of planter, land use, labour utilization, reasons for planting, problems faced in planting, future plans, planting characteristics (type of species planted, use of fertilizer, area planted, planting year, spacing, previous crops), tending and growth performance (land preparation, weeding, climber cutting, survival rate, replanting) and market perception (potential market, buyers and end-usage). The information presented here is derived from interviews with representatives of six companies and 21 individual planters who provided complete data to all the questions asked.1.
Basic information of the respondents.
Type of planter Most planters are individuals and only a minority are companies (Table 10). The six companies involved in forest plantation development are located in Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johore and Perlis. Among the individual planters, Malacca and Johore comprised two-thirds of the total individual planters.

Land use The pattern of agricultural land use indicates the extent of importance placed on tree planting by companies and individuals. Of the total 4 803 ha of agricultural land owned, 495 ha (10 percent) were planted with forest tree species. This is a new phenomenon considering the fact that in the 1980s not many people were seriously considering planting forest trees on private land. This change in land use is most noticeable among the individual planters. Of the 100 ha of agricultural.
The total number of companies and individuals surveyed was 157 and 1 575, respectively.
land owned, about 47 ha (46.5 percent) were planted with forest trees. Private companies allocated only 449 ha (9.5 percent) of the 4 702 ha of the agricultural land they owned to forest tree planting (Table 11). Two main reasons explain the difference. The younger people prefer to work in urban areas, which translates into labour shortages for agriculture. As most areas are small, it is not economic to employ local or foreign workers. As owners become older, they prefer to grow trees, which require less labour than annual crops, and are expected to provide income in the future. Private companies on the other hand are more cautious with regard to long-term investments in forest plantations.

There is a considerable difference in the area of land planted with forest trees between companies and individual planters (Table 12). The average land size is 75 ha per company and 2.2 ha for individual planters. This indicates that although fewer companies are involved in forest plantations their overall holdings are larger.

Main reasons for planting forest trees Income is the main reason for both private companies and individuals to engage in forest tree planting (Table 13). Most private companies based their decisions on financial analysis criteria such as the internal rate of return. Individuals on the other hand, based their decisions more on the expected future income rather than a detailed calculation of costs and revenues. The typical explanation by the individual planters is "we were told that planting forest trees would give very good returns in the future". Other reasons for planting forest trees are less important. They include crop diversification, soil rejuvenation, landscaping, recreation, an increased wood supply for timber-based factories, to set up a trial plot and to develop idle land.

Note: Some respondents gave more than one reason.
Labour input In general, companies employ more workers for forest tree planting activities than individual planters. The actual number of workers engaged in forest plantation activities is small (Table 14). Individual planters rely particularly on daily paid workers, as many are involved in other activities and do not have the time to take care of plantation establishment and management themselves. Many employ workers for labour-intensive activities such as weeding and fertilizing. The average number of workers engaged in forest plantation activities is four per company compared to one per individual planter (Table 15). People working for companies also tend to spend more days per month on activities related to forest plantations. Unfortunately, it was not possible to calculate labour inputs per hectare.

Problems faced by investors.
Forest tree planting on private land has faced a number of problems. The most important constraints appear to be lack of knowledge on tree planting, difficulty in selecting appropriate species, uncertain market prices, lack of land and difficulty in obtaining quality seedlings (Table 16).

Future intentions The future of private sector plantations in Peninsular Malaysia appears to look bleak. The future plans of most respondents do not include forest tree planting (Table 17). Only one company plans to extend its holdings. It has planted 20 ha of mixed tree species as buffer zones around its oil palm and rubber plantations. It plans to plant tembusu in 2002/03, balau in 2003/04 and binuang in 2004/05. The rest of the respondents apparently are in a wait-and-see mode. The general view is that if the trees grow well and the timber can be sold profitably, then most respondents would consider planting forest trees in new areas.

Plantation characteristics.
Species choice For the last 10 years, the two most popular tree species have been teak and sentang. The choice was very much influenced by the promotion of these two species by government agencies and the private sector. Monocropping and mixed cropping are equally important. Of the 27 respondents, 22 percent planted teak only, 22 percent sentang only and 4 percent Maesopsis eminii only. The remaining 52 percent had plantations composed of at least two species (Table 18).

Other than expected high economic returns, there are three main reasons for choosing a specific type of forest tree species for planting. Of the six companies, three felt that the selected species were suitable for the land type. Among the 21 individual planters, seven said that RISDA advised them to plant the species. For the individual planters, other reasons given included advice from friends, relatives and agents who sold seedlings, and investment for children. Area planted In 2002, the total area planted with forest trees by the 27 respondents was 495 ha comprising 448.6 ha (91 percent) by companies and 46.7 ha (9 percent) by individuals (Table 19). An obvious characteristic of tree planting is the pattern of mono- and mixed cultivation among the respondents. Of the total 448.6 ha managed by the six companies, 27 percent is monocropped. Individual planters on the other hand do not appear to have a preference for either monocropping or mixed cropping (Table 19). Teak accounts for 346.4 ha (70 percent), Maesopsis eminii for 96 ha (19 percent), sentang 44.9 ha (9 percent) and other mixed forest species 8 ha (2 percent). The individual planters also intercropped teak with banana and tongkat ali, which is not practised by the companies.

Planting year and spacing All the respondents planted trees between 1990 and 2000 (Table 20). While one-quarter of the individual planters planted trees between 1993 and 1995, companies only did so in the beginning of 1996. There were two phases of planting, namely the 1993/95 period involving only the individual planters, and the 1996/2000 period involving both individual planters and companies. No one planted in 2001.

The spacing selected was not uniform (Table 21). The respondents made their own decisions with regard to the planting distance. A good example is the individual planters who inter-cropped sentang and rubber in Malacca, encouraged by RISDA. Even though they attended the same briefing on forest tree planting, only two of them followed the same planting distance of 4 x 6.4 m.

Tree densities Tree densities varied considerably. For single species plantations, the density was 1 696 trees/ha for teak, 1 337 trees/ha for sentang and 625 trees/ha for Maesopsis eminii. In mixed plantations, the planting density of teak was between 800 and 1 000 trees mixed with banana, oil palm or tongkat ali. When mixed with rubber, the average planting density for sentang was 145 trees/ha (Table 22). Frequently, strict planting densities were not followed. The actual planting density was also influenced by landscape features. In low-lying areas, fewer trees were planted to avoid flooding.

These include light hardwood and medium hardwood (kembang semangkok, meranti sarang punai, meranti tembaga, meranti melantai, meranti rambai daun, meranti kepong, merawan siput jantan and kempas) and heavy hardwood and medium hardwood (penaga, perah, kelat and kapur).
Previous crops Of the 27 planters, 67 percent had planted rubber before converting the current area to forest trees (Table 23). The land of the remaining planters had been planted with oil palm (seven percent), fruit trees (11 percent) and other crops (15 percent). The conversion of rubber to forest trees was most obvious among the individual planters; this can be explained by labour shortages. Forest plantations are less labour intensive than rubber.

Terrain slope, altitude and soil type Most plantations were established on flat or gently sloping land (Table 24). In particular, individual planters preferred land with a gradient of 15 percent or less because most of them owned fairly flat land.

Most trees were planted at low elevations (Table 25). Seventy percent of the respondents planted on land below 100 m asl; another 22 percent planted on land between 100 and 300 m asl. Most individual planters owned land in the lowlands. This again is related to the location of smallholdings in lowland areas. Companies on the other hand, also planted trees above 500 m asl. This indicates that companies with widespread agricultural areas have allocated land at high altitudes to forest tree planting.

Fertilizer application All respondents applied fertilizer during and after planting. Common fertilizers applied during planting were chicken manure, phosphate, NPK and urea (Table 28). After planting, companies discontinued chicken manure application while the individual planters continued to apply this type of fertilizer. NPK was the most common fertilizer used during and after planting by companies and individual planters. All companies applied NPK only after planting.

Note: One company applied more than one type of fertilizer during planting.
Various reasons were given for choosing a specific fertilizer during and after planting (Table 29). Cost considerations were most important for companies. Of the six companies, four percent indicated that a particular fertilizer was used because of low cost while 17 percent attributed their choice to its availability and another 17 percent to ease of application. Two-thirds of the individual planters applied the fertilizer recommended by RISDA. Other reasons included low cost, availability, ease of application and perceived positive impact.

In general, the frequency of fertilizer application is about the same for companies and the individual planters (Table 30). Except for the first year when companies applied fertilizer three times (compared to two for individual planters), the number of fertilizer applications was the same from year 2 onwards. The average number of fertilizer applications declined to once a year from year 5 onwards.

Weeding Weeding was done in various ways (Table 31): over the total area (56 percent), using line weeding (22 percent), by circle weeding (11 percent) and by chemical spraying (four percent). Not all of the respondents weeded every year. The extent of weeding depended on the perception of the need to do so. In a certain year, no weeding would be done. For example, in year 1 of planting, one company and three individual planters did not weed as weed pressure was low.

Two individual planters did not weed at all. They perceived that weeding would reduce soil moisture especially during the dry period and this would increase pest infestations and diseases. They also felt that weeds retain soil moisture, which is important for tree growth especially during dry spells. Consequently, they attribute the good growth performance of their trees to lack of weeding. Climber cutting.
On average, companies cut climbers once a year during the first three years of planting. The individual planters rarely cut climbers.
Survival rate and replanting In general, the survival rate of trees was very high (Table 33). It was about 95 percent during the first three years of planting. Consequently, replanting was not done. There was no obvious difference in survival rate between mixed and single species plantations. The survival rate of teak that was inter-cropped with banana was low. This might be related to waterlogging on clay soils.

Height and diameter increment Table 34 shows that for single-species plantations, the average annual height increment was about 1.9 m (teak), 1.5 m (sentang) and 3.3 m (Maesopsis eminii). For mixed plantations, it was 1.7 m (teak and banana), 0.8 m (teak and oil palm), 0.8 m (teak and tongkat ali), and 1.3 m (sentang and rubber). This seems to indicate that in single-species plantations trees grew faster than when they were inter-cropped, although the differences were not very pronounced for sentang.

Market perception.
Forest plantation development on private land is still embryonic in Peninsular Malaysia. For the planters, market development and access are real concerns. Unlike commercial agricultural crops (e.g. rubber and oil palm) for which markets exist, the potential market for plantation-grown timber has yet to be established. Some respondents were unsure of the future market situation. Nevertheless, they were aware that markets for plantation-grown timber existed. Forty-five percent of the respondents stated their perceived market to be in-country, 22 percent to be foreign markets while 33 percent were undecided (Table 36). Apparently, for a slightly greater proportion of individual planters (48 percent) the domestic market was more important compared to companies (33 percent). A higher percentage of the latter perceive their markets to be in foreign countries (50 percent) than the former (14 percent). One possible reason for this difference is that companies have better access to information on foreign markets than individual planters.

While companies were aware of potential buyers and end-uses for their timber, individual planters were not (Tables 37 and 38). The companies felt that they could sell their timber to either trading agents or furniture mills in the form of sawntimber. Among the 21 individual planters, 63 percent stated that they could either sell their timber to trading agents or furniture mills. Another 33 percent did not know to whom they could sell their timber. Similarly, 47 percent of the individual planters did not have any knowledge of the potential end-uses for the timber they were producing.

Companies planted on larger areas and invested in more labour inputs for managing their plantations than individual planters. On average, each company planted 75 ha while individual planters established 2 ha only. For companies the lack of suitable land was a serious constraint for extending plantations. The individual planters established trees on their own land so land availability was not an issue. Common problems encountered in planting forest trees for both groups included appropriate species selection, difficulty in obtaining quality seedlings and lack of knowledge on planting. Half of the companies also faced labour shortage, which was not a problem for the individual planters. All the companies were aware of the potential markets and end-uses for plantation-grown timber, but approximately half of the individual planters lacked this knowledge. This indicates that more information on potential markets and end-uses of timber should be disseminated to encourage more planting.
Incentives for forest plantations To accelerate forest plantation development in Malaysia, incentives were introduced under the Promotion of Investment Act (PIA) 1986 and the Income Tax Act 1975 (Khaziah 1992). Under the PIA 1986, the two incentives offered were pioneer status (PS) and an investment tax allowance. Those who planted timber, rattan and bamboo, which were designated promoted activities under the PIA 1986, were granted PS. The Income Tax Act 1975 provided an allowance to investors in forest plantations.
The Malaysian Industrial Development Authority, 1986 (PIA 1986).
Pioneer status (PS) Before 11 January 1991, PS provided full exemption from income and development taxes for a period of five years. Since 1 November 1991, tax relief has been in the form of a 70 percent exemption from a company's statutory income. This means that a company granted PS would have to pay income tax of 35 percent and development tax of two percent on 30 percent of its statutory income. Hence the company is taxed at a rate of 11 percent on its overall income. A company granted PS would be eligible for the 70 percent exemption for a period of five years from the date of its first sale. Investment Tax Allowance (ITA) The ITA is an allowance of 60 percent of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred within five years from the date of approval of a project. In the case of agriculture, the term qualifying capital expenditure has been expanded to include the following: a. The clearing and preparation of land. b. The planting of crops. c. The provision of irrigation or drainage systems. d. The provision of plant and machinery used in Malaysia for the purpose of crop cultivation, animal farming, aquaculture, inland or deep-sea fishing, and other agricultural or pastoral pursuits. e. The construction of access roads, including bridges. f. The construction or purchase of buildings (including those provided for the people's welfare or as their living accommodation) and structural improvements on land or other structures that are used for crop cultivation, animal husbandry, aquaculture, inland fishing and other agricultural or pastoral pursuits; provided that for the purposes of paragraphs (e) and (f) such roads, bridges, buildings and structural improvements on land and other structures are on part of the land used for such crop cultivation, animal husbandry, aquaculture, inland fishing and other agricultural or pastoral pursuits. According to Khaziah (1992), the ITA is provided as a deduction against statutory income. In any given year, the amount deducted is limited to 70 percent of statutory income for that year. It appears that the incentives have not encouraged the private sector to invest in forest plantations in Peninsular Malaysia (Khaziah 1992). An additional option that was proposed to attract investors was "group relief" under the ITA (Khaziah 1992). Group relief in this context refers to offsetting losses with income from other profitable ventures of a company's subsidiaries. A revised version of the incentives has extended the PS for another five years for companies processing agricultural products, provided they fulfill certain criteria determined by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (Ministry of Trade and Industry 1988). The maximum rate was raised from 60 to 100 percent for the ITA. However, the 100 percent ITA can be granted only to companies that produce promoted products or are engaged in promoted activities (listed in Appendix 3 of the incentive package).
Risks involved in forest plantation development.
There are three major risks related to investments in commercial tree planting (CTP): Physical risk Market risk Financial risk Physical risk Major physical risks involved in CTP are the selection of the right species of tree to plant in certain soil types, the growth rates of the trees, the physical properties of the timber, the species' susceptibility to pests and diseases, fire, expected recovery rates and the type of silvicultural regimes required. In general, tree plantations are exposed to a higher risk of pest infestations and diseases than trees in the natural forest, because of the homogeneity of plantations. Poor seedling quality also increases susceptibilities. As large-scale planting requires a high number of seedlings to be available within a period (i.e. two to three months), it is sometimes difficult to obtain quality seedlings. The planting season usually starts prior to the onset of the wet season to ensure higher survival rates. At least one million seedlings would be required to plant an area of 1 000 ha. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that many CTP activities used poor-quality seedlings. Fire is another major physical risk. Bushfires are especially common during the dry season (the El Niño effect causing exceptionally long dry spells). Market risk Unlike agricultural products, which can be produced for sale within a short period of time (from a few months to one to two years), most forest trees can only be harvested after 15 years. Rotations depend on the management objective and future markets are inherently uncertain. For example, there is currently a high demand for rubberwood sawntimber. However, in another 15 years preference may shift to dark-coloured timber. It is difficult if not impossible for investors to change species in the middle of the rotation. Financial risk Financial risk is probably the most important factor explaining investor interest in forest plantations. The high financial risk associated with CTP is due to the long gestation period and the payback period. The long gestation period means that investors have to set aside sufficient capital for all plantation management activities until the final harvest. Many investors in CTP are currently facing cash flow problems. The physical and market risks can be overcome through proper planning and implementation. However, the financial risks and the uncertainty about future revenues have discouraged new investments in CTP. The existing incentives available for CTP have not addressed the cash flow problem adequately.
Constraints to plantation development.
Incentives for forest plantation development have been discussed for many years and there is a broad agreement that the existing incentives are unattractive as they do not address the cash flow problems adequately. According to Mohd Shahwahid and Saroni (1992) four factors explain the lack of interest in forest plantations. First, there is a shortage of suitable and sufficiently large areas in strategic locations.
Also, land is a state prerogative and it is difficult to obtain information on its availability. Second, if land is rented from the state, trees need to be planted and infrastructure developed within two years of signing a contract. This is sometimes difficult because of unforeseen problems. Third, interest rates for loans for tree planting ventures are not subsidized. Finally, the existing incentives have been designed for crops with shorter rotations and do not address adequately the long-term investments. Norini (1994) stressed the importance of establishing forest plantations not only for timber production but also for recreational uses or wildlife habitats. Such multiple uses may not only help investors in forest plantations to have a positive cash flow but may also make the project more financially viable. In other words, when issuing land use permits, governments should consider the multiple uses that can be derived from plantations.
Shortcomings of the incentives.
As mentioned above, tax incentives for CTP are provided for in the PIA 1986, the ITA 1967, Customs Act 1967, Sales Tax Act 1972 and Excise Act 1976. The PIA and the Income Tax Act are of particular relevance to CTP. The qualifying capital expenditure is designed for approved agricultural projects (Schedule 4A). Further, the qualifying status is subject to the following conditions (Income Tax [Approved Agricultural Projects] Order 2001): The forest plantation project is at least 50 ha; The period/rotation is six to 50 years depending on the type of species specified in the Second Schedule (73 species of tree, rotan (Calamus) and poring bamboo (Gigantochloa levis). Box.
Definition of production day "Production day" for single and multiple crop plantations with the same maturity would be from the date of the first harvest or subsequent harvests of the first establishment block. For plantations cultivated with more than one species of timber with different maturities, the companies can determine the "main/dominant crop" and "production day" will commence from the date of first harvest or subsequent harvests of the wood from the first establishment block. Production of latex does not qualify for any tax exemption. For plantations cultivated with cash crops, separate production days for the trees and the cash crops are considered, provided the cash crops cultivated are "promoted activities" under the Promotion of Investments Act, 1986. The pioneer status for the cash crops would be the 70 or 85 percent exemption from the statutory income as the case may be.

The current incentives are not effective for CTP and do not benefit investors, as they do not address cash flow problems associated with the long gestation period. Weaknesses of the PS The PS provides a 100 percent tax relief for an initial period of five years starting from "production day" and an additional five years after expiry of the first period. In the CTP, the production day may be 15 years or more from the planting. This means that a company has to wait for 15 years or more before it benefits from the tax relief, which is used to offset the profits earned from tree harvesting (illustrated in Figure 4). In many instances, the rotation may be even 25 years or more. Under such circumstances, an investor would rather invest in agricultural projects, which provide a return to investments much faster.

Schedule 4 A ­ agricultural allowance can be used in this period.
Weaknesses of the ITA The existing ITA allows qualifying expenditure to be given for the first five years only, whereas maintenance of planted areas goes beyond year 5 until the final harvest. Although the ITA allowance can be used to offset against statutory income and any unused portion can be carried forward indefinitely until all such balance is used up, it would take more than 15 years if the investor does not have any other sources of income in the interim. In this case, the ITA provides only benefits once profits are made. The same applies to pioneer status. Hence, the ITA is also not useful to investors during the management of the plantations. Agricultural allowance under Schedule 4A The recent Income Tax (Approved Agricultural Projects) Order 2002 has included forest plantation as an approved agricultural project, thus qualifying for tax relief effective from the year of assessment 1999. However, this incentive is not available if a company has been granted PS or ITA (to be offset against statutory income). In this case, PS, ITA and Schedule 4A are mutually exclusive. If the company chooses Schedule 4A then it is not entitled to PS or ITA. Unused qualifying capital expenditure can be carried forward to the next assessment year and until all of it has been fully written off. This is especially useful if the company is involved in other activities that are generating income. The major drawback of Schedule 4A, is that to qualify, the CTP needs to be at least 50 ha. This condition effectively excludes thousands of small-scale investors who may be interested in planting trees on areas far less than 50 ha.
The costs of preparing a Forest Management Plan and Annual Operating Plans, cost of environmental impact assessment and all costs and fees related to the procurement of timber certification are currently not classified as qualifying capital expenditures.
Latest development regarding the incentives.
The latest development regarding incentives is that the Ministry of Finance is willing to consider additional incentives on a case-by-case basis, according to the special incentives listed in the Budget 2000. This was stated in a letter forwarded to the Secretary of the Ministry of Primary Industries from the Secretary, Department of Treasury.
The need to develop more effective incentives for forest plantation development is obvious. The need to accelerate forest plantation development is highly evident considering the declining trend in timber production from the natural forest. Timber production in Peninsular Malaysia has declined drastically from more than 12 million m3 in the early 1990s to only five million m3 since 1998. A similar trend can also be observed in Sarawak and Sabah, where timber production dropped from 18 million m3 and eight million m3 in the early 1990s to 14 million m3 and three million m3 2000, respectively (Anonymous 2001). It is well known that the forest-based industries provide more than 300 000 jobs, especially in the rural areas (Anonymous 2001). A decline in timber production will affect the social well-being of many people. Therefore, it is imperative that more attention is paid to forest plantation development. Conclusions, policy implications and recommendations Main findings Interest in planting forest species has experienced wide swings over the last 15 years. The peak in planting activities during 1996 and 1997, when about 6 000 and 3 000 ha respectively were planted was followed by a steep decline. Since 1999, the private sector has planted less than 500 ha each year, although there is still a significant interest in tree planting. The major constraint to plantation development is a lack of appropriate incentives and shortage of suitable land. Although the area planted by commercial investors is significantly larger than the area planted by small-scale investors, the latter play an important role too. An important driving force for many farmers is that they are faced by labour shortages and would like to switch to less labour-intensive tree plantations. The implication is that if the individual planters have a better understanding of forest plantation establishment and management, more may prefer to plant forest trees for future benefits. Encouraging individual planters to plant forest trees is easier as they have land available. The role of RISDA is important in encouraging individual planters to plant forest tree species. Both the private companies and individual planters are constrained by a number of problems, including appropriate species selection, difficulty in obtaining quality seedlings, lack of knowledge on planting and labour shortage. Individual planters generally lack the knowledge of potential markets and end-uses for timber trees. This implies that more information on potential markets, end-uses and prices of timber needs to be disseminated. The information on financial returns is particularly relevant as income generation is the most important reason for planting trees. As stressed in Income Tax Order 2002 for approved agricultural projects (Order 5, First Schedule), and again in this report, for any forest plantation activity to be eligible for ITA, an area of at least 50 ha is required. This means that currently incentives favour large-scale plantations.
The period covered by the order depends on the type of species planted. For species such as sentang and teak, the period is 25 years, whereas for species such merawan (Hopea spp.) and kembang semangkok (Scapium spp.), the period is 50 years. A minimum size of 50 ha mentioned in Order 5, First Schedule of the Income Tax Order does not stress that the planted forest area must be contiguous. In other words, as long as investors have an area of at least 50 ha, they are eligible to apply for ITA.
Major policy implications and recommendations.
The main policy implications related to forest plantation development are in the areas of land, incentives, marketing and technology transfer. Land A basic question related to plantation establishment of any plantations is land availability. According to a baseline study conducted by FRIM and Jabatan Perhutanan Semenanjung Malaysia (JPSM) in 1996, there are more than 2.8 million ha of land suitable for conversion to forest plantations in Malaysia, although the area in Peninsular Malaysia itself is below 400 000 ha (Table 39).

Source: FRIM & JPSM 1996.
Of the 2.8 million ha, more than 1.5 million ha are located in Sarawak, more than 900 000 ha in Sabah and some 94 000 and 91 000 in Pahang and Kelantan, respectively (FRIM and JPSM 1996). Although in terms of area the figures are encouraging, in terms of status the situation is discouraging. For example, in Sabah, 334 163 ha are alienated or privately owned land, whereas the remaining 574 912 ha are state land. While it is possible to develop land that is owned by the state, planting on privately owned land is a major problem. The existing customary rights of the local people supersede the importance of land development. In addition, due to the rapid economic development some of the areas reported in 1996 are not available anymore. Nonetheless, the lack of suitable land should not be treated as a barrier to plantation development. One way of solving the land issue is to find solutions for using alienated land, which is sometimes left unattended. Another option is to establish joint ventures in other countries. Malaysian planters have been successful in establishing agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm. At this point, Malaysian investors should become better acquainted with opportunities and incentives for plantation development overseas. Incentives.
The existing incentives offered by the government are still not attractive enough to encourage potential planters to invest in forest plantations. Matters that need serious consideration by the government include incentives for the planting, management and harvesting stages. Group relief for CTP expenditure There have been a number of proposals from both the public and private sectors requesting the government to provide group relief incentives for companies involved in CTP (KTS Resources 2000; Abdul Razak 1997). This is similar to those given under Schedule 4C (Income Tax Act, 1967), that is, deduction for approved food production projects. Under this schedule, a company resident in Malaysia (referred to as a "surrendering company") may surrender its adjusted loss, in full or in part, for a given year of assessment of an approved project to one or more related companies resident in Malaysia, in the basis year for that year of assessment (referred to as a "claimant company"). Under Schedule 4C, a surrendering company is related to a claimant company if at the end of the basis period for a year of assessment at least: Seventy percent of the issued share capital of the surrendering company is directly owned by the claimant company; Seventy percent of the issued share capital of the claimant company is directly owned by the surrendering company; or Seventy percent each of the issued share capital of the surrendering company and claimant company is owned directly by another company. The other items that are proposed are as follows: The amount of adjusted loss surrendered shall be allowed as a deduction against the aggregate income of the claimant company pursuant to section 44(1); A surrendering company shall be allowed to transfer its CTP expenditure, in full or in part, to another related company resident in Malaysia; The claim for the deduction shall have the consent of the surrendering company on the quantum of CTP expenditure surrendered; The quantum of CTP expenditure to be surrendered in each fiscal year should be based on the area planted and maintained for that year; It is also proposed that a ceiling amount of group relief claim be fixed for each plantation company and this can be formulated by using the company's forest planting area as the basis for calculation; and The Group Relief shall not be mutually exclusive from PS or ITA (under Schedule 4C, group relief is not allowed if the surrendering company is given PS or ITA). Expand the list of qualifying capital expenditures The following activities should be included as qualifying expenditures in both the ITA and Schedule 4A: Costs of preparing the Forest Management Plan and the Annual Operating Plans; Cost of environmental impact assessment; Costs and fees related to timber certification (MTCC, FSC and others); Costs of surveying (e.g. boundary and compartment demarcation and maintenance); Costs of enrichment planting, silviculture, pest and disease control, and fire management; Capitalization of interest expenses incurred in immature areas up to the maturity date; The special agricultural allowance for CTP shall be calculated based on qualifying expenditure incurred and to be deducted fully against aggregate income from all sources;.
The special agricultural allowance for CTP shall be given on qualifying expenditure incurred during a period of up to 15 years from the date of first qualifying expenditure being incurred; The special agricultural allowance for CTP claimed against aggregate income shall be credited to an exempt income account for the franking of tax exempt dividends to shareholders; Companies enjoying CTP PS or CTP ITA shall not be precluded from claiming special agricultural allowance on qualifying expenditure on the CTP (under current law, Schedule 4A, PS and ITA are mutually exclusive). Investors in CTPs will invariably face serious cash flow problems until the final harvest (often up to 15 years or more). The current incentives do not address adequately the cash flow problem. The government should consider providing more effective incentives to increase the pace of plantation development to ensure that there is an adequate supply of logs to feed the existing and future timber processing mills. The tax incentives that would increase private sector involvement in CTP are as follows: a. During planting and management CTP ITA ­ qualifying capital expenditure be extended to 15 years (instead of the current five-year period) and this can be carried forward to be used during the harvesting period; and An alternative for the company to choose between group relief or Schedule 4A. b. During harvesting CTP PS for 10 years, commencing from production date; and ITA utilization. Marketing of plantation-grown timber The practice that is currently being used by RISDA, especially for selling latex and rubberwood logs, could be adopted. Such an approach is practical when dealing with smallholders who have problems selling their own timber. If such an approach were applied, relevant government agencies could act as one-stop agencies dealing with the buying and selling of timber from forest plantations. Technology transfer Technology transfer should be provided through extension services. Services should be rendered to clients from the planting to the harvesting stages continuously. To help planters successfully solve problems should be the objective of all interested parties. Research institutions should ensure that all new research findings related to forest plantation development reach clients in a timely manner. Such an effort would keep clients abreast of the most current issues related to forest plantation development.
This report has provided valuable insights into private sector involvement in forest plantation development in Peninsular Malaysia. There is a need to constantly monitor the activities of private forest plantation development in the country. This requires an accurate database that is continuously updated. Although investors currently are faced by a number of problems most of them can be solved to boost the development of forest plantations. Timber from forest plantations is considered the second most important source of raw material for the forest-based industries.
The need to find alternative raw material is urgent as the policy of reducing the production of timber from the natural forest is implemented. Therefore, the call for full commitment from all interested parties is louder than ever before. The government alone should not have to shoulder the task of developing forest plantations. Malaysians can work out the issue of forest plantation development together, which would benefit not only the parties involved but also the next generation.

<title>ADCP/REP/89/44 - A Review of Extension Methodologies in Aquaculture</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
An Expert Consultation on Planning for Aquaculture Development, organized by the ADCP in Policoro, Italy in 1988 (see ADCP/REP/89/33), identified an integrated set of opportunities for technical assistance to developing countries. These were predominantly a group of needs or ideas which collectively would assist in guiding investment decisions, primarily at the national level in both the public and private sectors.
One of the needs identified by the participants to better local infrastructure in support of producers was to improve ways of delivering appropriate extension information, particularly when new technology was involved. Countries which have large numbers of small-scale farmers were specifically requiring such help, especially those in Africa.
The Consultation noted, "that extension was an important interface between national producers and advancing technology. All current national projects involved in production had a component of extension, and this practice must be continued. Extension was a national function (and in many cases local) because of the diversity of aquaculture practices, languages, environment, and social and economic conditions. One immediate action at the national level was to seek wider involvement of agriculturists, particularly agriculture extension workers, to provide channels for improving the promotion of aquaculture in rural populations. However, support to the improvement of national extension could also be provided at the regional and sub-regional level to (i) organize and provide appropriate training for extension leaders at focal centres, (ii) transmit information about the concepts and importance of extension to senior management in government administrations through sensitization
seminars, and (iii) assist in the translation of extension materials to national languages, and even local dialects."
The Consultation also proposed appropriate actions at the interregional level, specifically to (i) examine and analyse known effective extension services, and catalogue, (ii) explore new approaches to extension, and (iii) disseminate new information to the regions. To the first of these ends, "A Review of Extension Methodologies" was commissioned by ADCP, and prepared by Carole R. Engle and Nathan M. Stone. It is intended to be a background document for future regional workshops which might explore new approaches to extension and subsequently produce new information for development. The document is also intended as a resource paper for training courses.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Role and Purpose of Extension in Aquaculture
1.2 The Role of Government Policy in Development of Extension Methodologies
Agricultural extension is now recognized as a potent and critical force in the development process. It has been defined as "a service or system which assists farm people through educational procedures in improving farming methods and techniques, increasing production efficiency and income, bettering their levels of living, and lifting the social and educational standards of rural life." (Maunder, 1973).
Functions generally attributed to agricultural extension include "to communicate agricultural research findings and recommendations to farm people, and to bring farm people into contact with sources of practical and useful information through organized group action". Activities of extension involve "agents working with farmers to teach improved farming practices, new techniques, and more productive or more efficient technologies ... organized within a system with administrative direction and support." (Axinn, 1988).
The structure, goals, strategies, and organization of any extension system vary with the multitude of sectoral goals and objectives of national governments. Therefore, any particular extension system reflects the underlying culture, philosophies, and priorities of the political, economic, and social environment in which it evolved.
The primary objective of this document is to present and discuss alternative aquaculture extension methodologies, strategies, techniques, and organizational structures. The intent is not necessarily to provide an all-encompassing census of extension systems, but rather to bring the principal issues to the fore. It is hoped that this document will stimulate discussion and analysis of aquaculture extension systems in different countries in the search for effective and efficient technology transfer mechanisms to further development of the aquaculture sector around the world.
Various sources were used to compile information for this document, such as project documents, interviews, telephone calls, and a survey instrument (Annex 1). The data from the survey represent the experience and opinions of those responding, and their help is gratefully acknowledged. Those who provided more specific information are cited. The document and the information it contains does not pretend to be a global encyclopaedia of aquaculture extension, but rather a vehicle for encouraging further thought and analysis of this most essential component of aquaculture development.
1.1 The Role and Purpose of Extension in Aquaculture
Aquaculture is a new technology in many parts of the world, while in others it is a well developed tradition. Such differences affect the scope and nature of extension efforts among different nations.
The primary purpose of aquaculture extension is to improve production of aquatic organisms for food and wealth for farmers, as well as for the nation as a whole. Extension programmes are justified by the fact that economic development resulting from extension activities should more than compensate for the national investment required to provide these services.
Extension activities can be divided into three primary functions:
(i) education,
(ii) services, and
(iii) liaison between government agencies, universities, and producers.
In some cases, aquaculture extension programmes include additional duties.
Education is often thought of as the primary function of extension activities. Extension programmes are designed to teach producers new technologies developed through research, and can take many forms. For example, extension agents may hold formal workshops, conferences, or producers' meetings to present new information. Agents also work one-on-one with individual producers, groups of producers, or cooperatives. Demonstration ponds may be developed on a particular farm to show to other farmers in the area the viability of a particular new aquaculture technology.
Many aquaculture extension programmes provide services to farmers. Some provide production inputs, such as fingerlings or transportation for feed; others build ponds for farmers, and those which target subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers may provide credit. In some cases, these services may be quite technical and consist of disease and water quality diagnoses,
The third primary function of extension programmes is a role of liaison with other government and private institutions. Extension agents provide an important link between researchers and farmers. In most cases researchers are not adequately skilled in communicating with farmers and frequently do not have the regular contact with farmers needed to transfer technologies effectively. Extension agents provide this important link. Finally, agents often coordinate contacts with other government organizations which provide health, housing, credit, or other services to the farmers.
1.2 The Role of Government Policy in Development of Extension Methodologies
Government policies and philosophies determine the structure of extension activities, the type of activities undertaken, and identify the target group. For example, some countries place great emphasis on rural development and programmes designed to improve the standard of living of rural poor; others place primary emphasis on industrial development or large-scale agriculture to stimulate economic development which may provide significant benefits to society as a whole. Extension is therefore matched accordingly.
At times this is not always easy. For example, one important source of funding for extension services in developing countries is international technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. However, the criteria set by the philosophies and goals of the host country and donor agency are often in conflict. A nation which places emphasis on food security may put priority on projects designed to improve the quality of produce consumed by the farm family. The value of products consumed in the home alone, however, is generally insufficient to satisfy donor requirements of acceptable financial rates of return (Molnar and Duncan, 1989).
These varying philosophies of government (and donor) on the process of development dictate which groups of people are targeted or affected by extension efforts. The manner in which extension is subsequently carried out depends consequently upon the characteristics of the target groups.

2. TARGET GROUPS
2.1 Private Producers
2.2 Cooperatives
2.3 Subsistence Producers
2.4 Selection of Target Groups
The selection of target groups for extension programmes often results in a highly emotional debate. Selection is generally determined by government policy, although government policy does not always represent the attitudes and philosophies of all individuals in society.
Selection of target groups may precipitate debates which range from ideological/philosophical posturings to pragmatic assessments of a nation's capability of providing extension services dictated by a particular philosophy. Extension services represent a large investment with returns occurring over the long-term. Rarely are returns immediate in nature. Budgetary resources may not permit the level of investment which a sense of moral obligation to strive for social justice may require.
Who will be the beneficiaries of the aquacultural extension system? Target groups can be identified and categorized in several ways. In many countries policy debates are common on whether to carry out extension with the purpose of maintaining low consumer prices, or helping rural producers to achieve higher standards of living through higher prices for their commodities.
Aquaculture projects often specify goals of enhancing rural incomes, nutrition, and overall food security for smallholders (Ben-Yami, 1987). At the other end of the spectrum the need for foreign exchange (which can be obtained by export of high-value commodities such as salmon and shrimp) has resulted in capital-intensive aquaculture systems for large-scale commercial producers (Bailey, 1988).
A second policy issue revolves around emphasis on private producers or cooperatives. Often the argument is phrased as a decision to work primarily with large- or small-scale farmers. This decision is closely related to national philosophies on economic development strategies.
2.1 Private Producers
Some countries identify private producers as the targets for extension activities. Private producers are defined in this document as farmers who work for themselves, receive benefits from their management and control of the aquaculture enterprise, and assume the consequences of any wrong decision. Private producers can be small-scale farmers working individually, or large-scale commercialized farmers. The common denominators are the private ownership and management control of the farm pond(s).
Private producers have strong incentives to adopt those technologies which will benefit them the most, and from which a tangible reward can be obtained for their efforts. The challenge to extension, in general, is to demonstrate effectively to farmers the benefits of any proposed technology, and to ensure adequate feedback from farmers as to its on-farm feasibility.
Private producers can be difficult to work with if farms are small, isolated, and difficult to reach. In these cases extension agents may invest enormous amounts of energy, fuel, and effort to visit remote areas with relatively little time to work directly with the farmer. Ambitious programmes, which call for working and attending to large numbers of such farmers, may place unrealistic demands on both the energy of extension agents and transportation resources of many countries. Some countries have developed ingenious methods of handling these types of situations; for example, see the case studies for Rwanda (Section 4.4.2) and Zaïre (4.4.3).
On the other hand many large producers provide a different set of problems for extension programmes. For example, large producers may be more educated than extension agents and consider them poorly trained, and some purposely try to avoid extension agents if they fear that the agent may communicate their production secrets to other farmers.
Despite these difficulties, the trend in aquaculture extension has been to move away from emphasis on group and cooperative efforts to services for private producers. Efforts to encourage community and group aquaculture projects have generally met with little success.
2.2 Cooperatives
Many development efforts of international assistance agencies have been oriented towards cooperative groups. In this approach individuals are not favoured with special privileges, and extension resources are used efficiently by working with a group of people rather than one person at a time.
The investment required in both capital and labour to construct fish ponds has been the basis for encouraging cooperative or group efforts in aquaculture. For example, instead of 10 small ponds constructed at high cost per water surface area, one large pond could be constructed at a much lower cost and would supply the same number of people with fish. Moreover, one large pond requires only one good site, while 10 small ponds require 10 good sites. Individual subsistence farmers may have insufficent land to set aside part for a fish pond, but the government may be willing to provide land to a group of farmers for an aquaculture project.
However, grouping farmers is not always easy. For example, cooperative efforts in Panama appeared to be hindered by the organizational complexity related to socio-economic inequality, existing cattle ranching operations, and divisions between members and non-members (Lovshin et al., 1986). But younger, married, and relatively well-informed men with large households were especially attracted to group fish culture projects.
Socio-economic homogeneity, and socially esteemed and influential leaders (but not rich) are factors which contribute to the success of group projects. Nevertheless, many cooperative groups have not functioned well. In general cooperatives are short-lived, but there have been exceptions. The basic problem is to provide adequate incentives for farmers to share the workload. Inevitably some individuals work harder than others, and become disgruntled when those who do not work as hard receive the same benefits as they do. In fish production it is especially difficult to determine whether an individual has contributed his or her share of work, or if he or she has harvested more than a fair share. In cases where cooperatives have been successful, there is generally a strong and highly-respected leader who has been able to maintain unity. If this person leaves, however, the cooperative usually fails.
2.3 Subsistence Producers
A common debate in development philosophy related to extension is whether to work directly with the poorest people, or to work with wealthier farmers and hope that the technology "trickles down" to lower economic strata. In societies which are highly stratified in economic and social terms, choosing to work only with the wealthier class prevents the technology from reaching the poorer strata. In practice the "trickle down" theory rarely works.
In 1979 the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development declared that "... most development efforts have not yet succeeded in satisfying the aspirations of peoples and their basic requirements consistent with principles of human dignity and international social justice and solidarity, especially in the rural areas of developing countries. Rural development strategies can realize their full potential only through the motivations, active involvement, and organization at the grass-roots level of rural people, with special emphasis on the least advantaged." (FAO, 1981).
Efforts directed towards the "poorest of the poor" meet with enormous obstacles. Many of the world's farmers are landless or tenants. Poverty itself indicates a very low level of resources to work with to provide both food and income for the family.
It is far easier to work with people who have a certain level of resources which at least permits them to provide some amount of surplus production to accumulate capital or other resources. However, if the participants in a project are all extremely wealthy the technology may be perceived as one which is only appropriate for the upper economic strata.
In some cases the expressed target group may be subsistence farmers, while in fact the majority of extension efforts are devoted to larger-scale producers. If donor agencies insist on funding only projects devoted to subsistence producers then there is a strong incentive to state them as the target group whether or not this is based on reality.
2.4 Selection of Target Groups
The types of extension strategies selected depend to a large degree on the target groups selected. Selection of target groups may be, in some cases, by default and not through a conscious effort, and strategies effective for one group may not work for another.
An effective extension programme designed to service large-scale commercial producers should be managed differently from one designed to work primarily with subsistence producers. This paper will attempt to draw from the experiences of various nations, and identify which extension responsibilities, strategies, methods, and organizational structures have been most effective for different target groups and different government objectives.
Table 1 presents data of respondents to the survey instrument (Annex I) on the types of groups targeted by aquaculture extension programmes in a number of countries and regions. With the exception of the Philippines, Panama, and Uruguay, commercial producers were not the targeted group of aquaculture extension efforts. This may be due largely to reasons expressed by several respondents that private producers actually had more advanced technology than researchers or extension agents. Large companies, particularly shrimp farmers, either hire researchers and have developed their own proprietary technology on private research stations, or fund university or government research. In the Philippines respondents from projects of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), colleges, and universities indicated that extension programmes did not target commercial producers, while the Inland Resources Development Corporation worked primarily with private commercial
concerns.
Subsistence producers are most often targeted by aquaculture extension efforts. All countries responding, except Ecuador and Uruguay, targeted subsistence producers. Approximately half of the respondents indicated that cooperatives were targeted, while approximately two-thirds targeted private producers. Four of the countries responding (the Philippines, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay) targeted both private and cooperative producers.
Regardless of the target group, careful selection of individual cooperators is of great importance, especially in the early stages of a programme where there is a need to demonstrate that the production technology is sound. Extension theory classifies personality types according to an individual's propensity to adopt new ideas and technologies. Individuals are classified as (a) innovators, (b) early adopters, (c) late adopters, and (d) laggards.
In this scheme extension theory says that early adopters are the best contact persons for extension personnel. Innovators may be too far ahead of what is practical at a certain point in time, and may be seen as unusual or extreme. Early adopters are, on the other hand, interested in new ideas, but are also respected by neighbours and more likely to be perceived as resembling them. While laggards probably have the greatest need, they generally are the least likely to change and adopt new technologies. Extension theory maintains that the greatest long-term effect will occur if extension activities focus on early adopters. If the likelihood of adopting change is low, extension resources may not be well spent and overall change may be slow.

3.1 Education
The primary responsibility of extension personnel world-wide is that of education. Technology transfer is an educational process orchestrated by extension personnel through both formal and informal means.
Formal education by extension personnel takes the form of workshops designed to focus on specific topics, conferences, seminars, and producer meetings. Extension personnel also engage in in-service training of extension agents who are responsible for day-to-day contact with producers. These formal education sessions may focus on a wide array of different topics, from specific management practices to more general technical theories of relationships between stocking and harvest size, and even oxygen fluctuations in ponds and disease diagnosis.

Extension personnel also spend a great deal of time in informal education through farm visits. For example, good extension personnel who get a first-hand view of farm operations can often notice potential problems, and even discuss particular difficulties of an individual's ponds. Farm visits also provide farmers with the opportunity to ask questions on different topics, problems, and issues which are not covered in formal seminars.
Farm-level demonstrations are techniques of informal education in which the extension agent demonstrates a particular technique to improve farm operations for an individual or group of farmers. Hands-on training and education, working side by side with farmers, is an effective albeit time-consuming means to transfer technology.
Educational activities also include dissemination of information to producers and consumers, through, for example, newsletters, newspaper articles, television and radio broadcasts, and utilization of other media. Specific technologies or techniques may also be presented at fairs, markets, and other public gatherings. Printed materials in the form of popular magazines or comics, manuals, bulletins, fact sheets, and books, all contribute to the educational process.
Almost all (87%) of the countries responding to the survey utilized formal education methods (see Table 2).
Only two countries (Colombia and Uruguay) indicated that they did not have organized extension services for aquaculture. All but one country (Uruguay) utilized informal education methods. Uruguay is a country with little aquaculture extension.
3.2 Diagnostic Services
Extension services for the agriculture sector invariably establish and provide technical services; for example, seed and soil testing services. These services may be free, charged at cost, or operated for a profit. Most aquaculture extension services provide water quality diagnostic services. Extension agents are often provided with a water-test kit as part of their standard equipment. Basic parameters for water quality can be analyzed to identify its suitability for raising fish, or other aquatic organisms, and to determine the need and quantity of lime and fertilizer. Extension agents with water test kits also have the capability to provide advice on water quality problems related to pond fertility, oxygen, and management.
Many extension services provide disease diagnostic services and recommend treatments to aquaculture producers. This service becomes important in areas where aquaculture has reached industrial levels of production. Most disease and water quality problems originate in extremely fertile ponds as a result of high rates of feeding. In many countries the lack of production inputs for fish farming, such as feed and inorganic fertilizers, results in low pond fertility, and hence production. For most extensive systems, with low levels of production, disease problems are rarely significant and do not justify investment in a laboratory and equipment for disease diagnosis.

In rural areas transport and communications are such problems that diagnostic services are not practical. Most disease or water quality problems require a quick response. By the time the agent arrives at the pond, the problem and symptoms may be past. In such situations there is virtually no need for disease or even extensive water quality diagnostic services.
3.3 Supply of Production Inputs
Some countries provide production inputs to new and aspiring aquaculture producers. The decision to supply or not to supply these inputs is most often dictated by overall prevailing political philosophies. For example, in some countries development strategies are based on the concept that the government is responsible for providing all essential inputs. This is often the case where individual producers have extremely limited resources.
Farmers participating in development projects may have difficulty arranging transportation for production inputs. Extension agents often are assigned transportation, and use it to transport materials to farmers on regular visits. For example, feed for livestock (pigs and poultry) which produce manure to fertilize fish ponds may be transported by extension agents.
Only five of the 15 countries responding transported production inputs to fish farmers (see Table 2). The five were Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe (in Africa), Thailand (Asia), and Panama (Latin America). In many of these countries transportation itself is often difficult, and fuel shortages are commonplace, particularly for the government sector. These factors drastically restrict the functioning of government programmes.
Six of the 15 countries responding (Cameroon, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Colombia, and Guatemala) indicated that, as a rule, production inputs were supplied to fish farmers. Three of these (Cameroon, Zimbabwe, and Guatemala) specified that the only input was fish seed.
Fingerling production requires a higher level of management than grow-out. New fish farmers lack the required level of management skills to produce their own fingerlings successfully and reliably. Fingerlings may also represent a substantial cost for subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers.
Many nations have developed a policy of supplying fingerlings to producers participating in government projects. The rationale involves a somewhat paternalistic attitude that poor farmers cannot afford to purchase their own seed, and that on-farm seed production is difficult to achieve. Seed distribution is also a quantifiable means of justifying a government station, personnel, and other facilities, and therefore the need for fish seed may be used as a tool by politicians to lobby for hatcheries in their home regions. The pressure to justify the existence of hatcheries may also result in production of "paper" or "book" fish, instead of accurate accounts of fingerlings harvested and distributed.
If government hatcheries consistently supply seed to producers at no charge, the producers may become dependent on the government. Free seed from the government may prevent development of a fingerling production industry and may hinder the growth of a viable aquaculture sector.
Panama has an explicit policy of selling fingerlings at production cost, and encouraging farmers to produce their own seed on farm (Lovshin et al, 1986). Aquaculture development experts believe that the first step towards a viable sector is to transfer seed production technology to farmers who possess adequate resources and conditions (Torrans, 1989).
In Liberia government hatcheries have been transferred to the private sector and are operated by private entrepreneurs (Avault, 1984; Torrans, 1988). While government capital was used originally to construct the seed production infrastructure, government management preferred the greater efficiency afforded by private producers. The same policy has been practised by many developed countries.
Fish culture projects may provide capital to construct fish ponds. In some cases capital is represented by equipment to construct ponds, and may or may not include materials needed for pipework or water supply structures. In Liberia the Nimba County Rural Development Project furnishes the "monk" (the drain unit for the pond) and free fingerlings. The farmer provides the labour for pond construction, and rice bran for feeding (Avault, 1984).
In Panama the Ministry of Agricultural Development (or military units) generally provides bulldozers for earthmoving. Project participants provide labour, housing, and food for the bulldozer operators, diesel fuel for the bulldozer, and all other materials needed to construct the ponds.
The practice of providing production inputs to fish farmers is controversial. It is generally easier for the extension agent to supply seed rather than train farmers to produce their own. On the other hand, government funding for hatcheries may not be reliable, transport needed to deliver the fingerlings may break down, or there may be innumerable other problems, all of which prevent the necessary materials from arriving at the production site when needed, or delivery of fingerlings at the critical time. Farmers who rely on the government to provide these services do not, in general, develop alternative sources of supply or transportation. If government infrastructure breaks down, as it often does, farmers simply do not have the inputs when needed, and production consequently suffers. In practice, dependency on the responsibility of the government to supply production inputs is often cited as a major cause of failure of aquaculture projects (Torrans, 1989).
3.4 Product Promotion
Some countries with low annual per caput rates of fish consumption may develop extension programmes with activities to encourage consumption of fish. Such programmes, which are common in Latin America, may include distribution of recipes, radio advertisements, demonstrations of preparation methods for fish, and facts on nutritional qualities of fish.
There are several other suitable extension activites used to promote farm products, especially marketing. For example, in Mexico fish markets have been constructed at each fish station to sell production. Nicaragua has mobile vendors to sell fish purchased by the government from fishermen and fish farmers, and eight fish sales modules were constructed in Bolivia in 1988 (Centre de Desarrollo Pesquero, 1989). The government invested in these modules to improve sanitary conditions of fish markets, enhance the appearance of fish and fish products, and to stimulate changes in consumer habits.
3.5 Enforcing Regulations
In some countries, particularly those in which aquaculture functions are included in a ministry responsible for fisheries, natural resources, and wildlife, aquaculture extension responsibilities may be assigned to agents already charged with regulatory (licensing and enforcement of regulations) and other policing activities.
In four of the responding countries (Zimbabwe, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru), extension agents have responsibility for regulation and enforcement of laws governing fisheries and natural resources (see Table 2). In the three Latin American countries aquaculture extension is carried out by a fisheries ministry or institute, whereas Zimbabwe has both extension and natural resource regulatory functions in the natural resource ministry. There were, however, several of the other countries in which a fisheries or natural resource ministry was responsible for aquaculture extension, but the extension agents did not have regulatory responsibilities.
The rationale for including regulatory responsibilities with those of technology transfer stems from the limited resources available to many government agencies, and the need to economize. If any government agent is in the field, and particularly working with fish, it is more cost effective to have the agent patrol fisheries waters and look for violators of fishing regulations.
Assigning regulatory responsibilities to an extension agent, however, automatically relegates the agent to a position of antagonist to the farmer. This is unfortunate, as an effective extension agent is one who gains the trust and confidence of producers. An effective extension agent is perceived by client producers as having their best interests at heart. Trust is essential for the transfer of new technology because producers depend on the agent's word and reputation. By placing the extension agent in a position of enforcing regulations (and particularly one wearing a uniform), the agent's ability to gain the confidence and trust of the producers is hampered.
3.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Extension Responsibilities
The principal role of extension agents is that of educator. As stated above, whether education is formal or informal the essential purpose of extension is to transfer technology from researchers to producers in whatever manner is most effective. Any other role assumed by an extension agent takes time away from this fundamental activity.
Other roles assumed by an extension agent may result in preventing ancillary business activities from being developed by the private sector. For example, if the extension agents provide a full complement of diagnostic services, at low cost, there would be no market for a private entrepreneur to invest in a water-test kit and begin to develop a business diagnosing water quality problems. If the government, through its extension agents, constructs ponds for producers, provides fingerlings free of charge, or transports feed for livestock, there is no incentive for other individuals to provide these same services. If the government encounters budgetary or political difficulties, the lack of supply of these essential production inputs may endanger the success of the project. On the other hand, unless pond construction is subsidized, the expense of construction may prohibit small-scale farmers from becoming involved in aquaculture.
If an extension agent's defined responsibilities are too broad in scope, it may be impossible for him or her to give good advice in all areas. For example, the background education of most agents is in agriculture or biology, with little or no economics or finance training. But extension agents are often called upon to evaluate credit worthiness of loan applications. The agent may not be adequately prepared to assess credit worthiness properly, and improper recommendations may result.

4. EXTENSION PHILOSOPHIES
4.1 Centralized Versus Decentralized Control Over Extension Activities
4.2 Direction of Information Flow
4.3 Appropriate Extension Strategies
4.4 Case Studies
Strategies of aquaculture extension are as diverse as national political philosophies and goals. The following chapter is a discussion of several of the predominant approaches to agriculture extension programmes. The discussion will focus on (a) centralized versus decentralized control over extension activities, (b) selection of extension agents, (c) direction of information flow, and (d) specific techniques of extension appropriate for different target groups for different levels of extension involvement.
Axinn (1988) identified 8 different approaches to extension work. These are briefly summarized below:
(a) The general agricultural extension approach. The purpose is to help farmers increase their production. Planning is done on a national basis by the central government "which knows better than farmers". This is a typical case of top-down planning. Field personnel tend to be large in number and high in cost, with the central government bearing most of the cost. The rate of adoption of important recommendations and increases in national production are the measures of success. A survey of agricultural extension programmes indicated that agricultural extension generally was part of the Ministry of Agriculture, with field extension officers at the bottom of the hierarchy and a minister at the top (FAO, 1971). This approach lacks a two-way flow of information. It fails to adjust messages for each different locality. Only farmers who seek advice benefit, and these tend to be large-scale wealthier farmers. This approach does provide farmers with information on a number of
production alternatives from one single source.
(b) The commodity specialized approach. All functions related to a particular commodity are grouped together, including extension, research, input supply, output marketing, and prices. Planning is controlled by a commodity organization for the purpose of increasing production of a particular commodity. Highly trained scientific personnel equipped with expensive vehicles and field scientific apparatus are employed. Techniques recommended must produce financial benefits for farmers, and be demonstrable on a farmer's own field. New inputs must be accessible, a credit scheme established, and the ratio between farm-gate inputs and commodity prices considered. Technology tends to be appropriate and distributed in a timely manner because it focuses on a narrow range of technical concerns. Interests of farmers, however, may have less priority than those of commodity production organizations.
(c) The training and visit approach. The purpose of the training and visit approach (often called T & V) is to induce farmers to increase production of specified crops. Planning is controlled centrally and field personnel tend to be numerous and dependent on central resources. There is a rigid pattern of visits to farmers and in-service training of field staff. Success is measured in terms of production increases of the particular crops covered by the programme. The training and visit approach is another top-down approach. The emphasis is on disseminating unsophisticated, low-cost improved practices, and teaching farmers to make best use of available resources. There is pressure on the government to reorganize into a more integrated service, and to send extension officers into the field to meet with farmers. It provides closer technical supervision and logistic support, but at a high cost. Actual two-way communication is lacking and there is little flexibility.
(d) The agricultural extension participatory approach. This approach assumes that farmers are skilled in food production from their land, but their levels of living could be improved by additional knowledge. Active participation by farmers themselves is necessary and produces a reinforcing effect in group learning and group action. Much of the work is through group meetings, demonstrations, individual and group travel, and local sharing of appropriate technologies. Success is measured through numbers of farmers actively participating, and the continuity of the programme. There is much to be gained by combining indigenous knowledge with science. Expressed needs of farmers are targeted. The system requires that extension workers, who are also animators and catalysts, stimulate farmers to organize for group efforts. Local people evaluate their own programmes and play a role in establishing research agendas.
The agricultural extension participatory approach costs less, fits needs well, and is more efficient. However, it is more work for extension agents to organize and motivate farmers. It requires agents to live and to socialize with farmers. Where a government job is seen as a reward for good friends, the "hardship" implied by this approach dooms it to failure. The agent will be there only "part time" and have no personal stake in the outcome.
(e) The project approach. This approach uses large infusions of outside resources for a few years to demonstrate the potential of new technologies. Control is at the central government level and there is often considerable financial and technical inputs from an international development agency. Short-term change is the measure of success. In the aquaculture project in Nepal, for example, a loan from the Asian Development Bank was used by the Ministry of Agriculture to support extension work by fisheries officers in many different locations throughout the country. They were able to introduce pond fisheries through an effort which combined the project approach with the specialized commodity approach. One problem with this approach, however, is that a flow of ideas outside the project rarely occurs.
(f) The farming systems development approach. This approach assumes that technology which fits the needs of farmers, particularly small-scale farmers, is not available and needs to be generated locally. Planning evolves slowly and may be different for each agroclimatic farm ecosystem. This approach is implemented through a partnership of research and extension personnel using a systems approach. Analyses and field trials are carried out on farmers' fields and in homes. The measure of success is the extent to which farm people adopt technologies developed by the programme and continue to use them over time. Control of the programme is shared jointly by local farm families, extension officers, and researchers. Advantages of this system include strong linkages between extension and research personnel, and the commitment of farmers to using technologies they helped to develop. Costs can be high, and results can be slow in coming.
(g) The cost sharing approach. This approach is based on local people sharing part of the cost of the extension programme. Control and planning is shared by various entities and is responsive to local interests. Success is measured by farmers' willingness and ability to provide some share of the cost, be it individually or through local government units. Problems may arise if local farmers are pressured into investing in unproven enterprises.
(h) The educational institution approach. In the educational institution approach, planning is controlled by those determining the curriculum of the educational institution. Implementation is through nonformal instruction in groups or individuals through a college or university. Attendance and the extent of participation by farmers in agricultural extension activities are the measures of success. Ideally researchers learn from extension personnel who, in turn, learn from farmers. However, this rarely occurs in practice. The advantage of this approach is the relationship of specialized scientists to field extension personnel.
4.1 Centralized Versus Decentralized Control Over Extension Activities
Extension services world-wide are organized on different principles. In some countries extension programmes serve to transmit national directives to rural areas. Rural areas are perceived to be highly traditional, resistant to change, and unaware of technological advances. What research work is done is often conducted by the government or by universities located in urban areas. Thus the centre of technological development lies in urban settings, and extension agents are responsible for transmitting this information to rural areas. The educated elite of many countries generally reside in urban areas. They are the few who possess language skills, and have access to libraries and other sources of information unavailable to inhabitants of rural areas. Given this base of information in the urban areas, decision-makers often feel better qualified to set national priorities and establish directives to carry them out. Under this scenario there is very little feedback from rural
areas in terms of technology development, or the extension process itself.
Many extension approaches and strategies rely on technology transfer with top-down development without having a framework for feedback from farmers (Axinn, 1988). For example, Avault (1984) believed that "any viable fisheries program must be built from the top down". In more recent years the shift has been towards greater farmer participation, although it is difficult, especially with a new technology, to have the patience to elicit farmer response. It is far too easy to assume the farmer does not understand.
Feedback is essential for adapting production practices to local conditions. Technologies developed in other countries or by universities may not be applicable, or may conflict with established farming practices tested over generations under specific conditions of the rural areas of that particular agroecological system. Farming systems research is based on the premise that research developed at experiment stations must be adapted to farm conditions and realities. The emphasis in farming systems research is on developing farmer collaborators which conduct field trials on-farm, and work in close collaboration with researchers. This type of approach to research has resulted in important observations and feedback to researchers which, in many cases, has resulted in modifications of the original technology implemented. Many development experts feel strongly that, without feedback from producers during the development process of the technology, the technologies transmitted have
little chance to be successful.
Table 3 presents results from the survey on centralized versus decentralized control over extension activities. When asked the extent to which extension programmes were initiated at the local level, only Rwanda and Thailand responded that this occurred often or frequently. Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, and Uruguay respondents indicated that this happened rarely, while the rest said "sometimes". The respondent from Jordan indicated that this never happened. Respondents from different institutions in the same country had different responses to these questions.
The Cameroons, Rwanda, and the Philippines indicated that producers were frequently involved in planning aquaculture extension programmes. Respondents from Zaïre, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Thailand, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Peru said that this sometimes occurred, while those from Tanzania and Mexico said that this never or rarely occurred.
Survey data indicated that extension offices were most often located in cities other than the capital, and/or in rural areas. Eight of the respondents indicated that the extension services were located in the capital cities, while nine others indicated that extension offices were located in rural areas. Most countries seemed to have offices located in both cities and rural areas.
Where extension services are located in cities, agents travel daily from the city to visit farmers in rural areas, with occasional overnight trips. The range of activity is extremely limited, and there is little or no involvement with local or even regional officials.
One important problem with locating extension offices in rural areas is the difficulty of encouraging extension personnel to relocate. If extension agents are relatively well-educated, they will generally prefer to reside in the capital cities where there are more social amenities, and may consider it a demotion to be assigned to a rural office. Even if they work in an urban setting, transportation difficulties and a general lack of interest in rural areas are obstacles to developing a strong extension programme.
Extension offices located in rural areas may decrease the miles travelled by extension agents, but in many cases the local transportation budget is not increased concomitantly. As transportation budgets of rural offices are invariably lower than those of the city offices to begin with, rural offices cannot afford to buy fuel. Many rural offices have no telephones or other communication systems necessary for extension efforts.

There have been efforts to decentralize extension programmes in several countries, such as Panama and Nicaragua. In the case of Nicaragua the extension agents must work with representatives of other agencies, and their respective representatives, in each community. In Panama the aquaculture extension agents are responsible directly to the local Ministry of Agriculture officials and not to the centralized National Aquaculture Directorate. This type of arrangement makes the programme more responsive to local initiatives and allows more local input into programmes and activities. It also provides a mechanism for collaboration with branches of other agencies which provide extension services as well. On the other hand, this arrangement removes control from aquaculture specialists in other cities. People in decision-making positions in outer regions or provinces are less likely to be knowledgeable about the requirements of aquaculture, and are more likely to respond to purely
political rather than technical pressures.
If funding for aquaculture extension efforts is controlled locally, aquaculture funding may be subverted to other programmes which are more politically expedient. If aquaculture is given a high priority in that region, local control of funding may be advantageous in that funds can be directed toward those areas and projects with the greatest chance of success. People living in those particular areas will have the best ideas of which areas are likely to be most successful.
Funding control of all African programmes was predominantly at the national level. In Thailand and the Philippines, and countries of Latin America, funding was controlled more often at the local or regional level. Respondents from different institutions in each country had differing responses to this question (see Table 3).
4.2 Direction of Information Flow
The direction of information flow is intimately related to the structure of the extension service. In many areas, directives are passed down to area extensionists from centralized offices which develop national directives based on national priorities. In countries with readily available and efficient communication services, and homogeneous populations, this type of system may work well if the national policy-makers are in touch with needs of aquaculture producers. In many countries, however, urban planners and policy-makers are far removed from the realities of rural areas. Plans and policies may be drastically different from the crucial problems of rural areas to the extent that producers cannot understand the importance or relevance of the policies. Without producer support and enthusiasm for new programmes and policies there is little chance of success.
Some of the more successful development efforts are those which have involved producers in the planning and development of programmes as well as in implementation and evaluation (Engle, 1986). These types of programmes have greater likelihood of success because local producers can incorporate local priorities and concerns into a programme which also addresses national priorities and concerns. Problems arise when local and national concerns are sharply at odds, but institutionalizing a dialogue between the two groups may provide mechanisms for resolving differences and arriving at some workable compromise.
An important indicator of the potential for a successful aquacultural extension programme is the attitude of administrators towards extension. Extension is often not well understood or appreciated by administrators and programme planners. Pay scales for extension workers may be lower than for other comparable positions, and the post of extension worker often is considered of lower status than that of researcher or enforcement officer. Extension programmes commonly are attached to projects to justify project expenses without any real concern for the success of the extension phase. Administrators without extension experience may themselves be afraid to deal with farmers, and may be resentful of extension agents.
Extension agents may not understand the importance of providing central administration with sufficient documentation to justify the programme and continue its funding. The importance of a good understanding between extension agents, administrators, and programme planners highlights the need for two-way communication. Involvement of extension personnel in project planning will help in setting realistic goals. Respect and attention paid to extension agents by administrators provides essential motivation.
Project monitoring efforts may or may not include feedback mechanisms to ensure a two-way flow of information. Often project evaluations are conducted based on objective indicators of project accomplishments, without including target group evaluation of the success of a particular project.
4.3 Appropriate Extension Strategies
In many regions of the world, such as Africa and Latin America, aquaculture is a new technology and a novel concept. In these situations, much investment in training, demonstration, and infrastructure development is necessary to support the introduction and spread of aquaculture as a farm enterprise (Molnar and Duncan, 1989). Raising animals in an aquatic environment has specific constraints quite different from those involved in raising land-based livestock or crops. It takes time for farmers to adapt to the aquatic environment, and the technology transfer process is lengthier than it would be to transfer a technology more similar to traditional crop and livestock enterprises.
It appears that the best means for achieving success in working with subsistence farmers in rural areas is through the use of "promotores", "link workers", or "moniteurs" from that local area. There also needs to be a local source of fingerlings, and farmers need to group and associate. Transferring technology to subsistence farmers requires a long-term sustained effort with relatively few farmers. The emphasis must be on quality, not quantity. The process involves intensive training and effort, but less capital in station construction. For medium-scale producers college graduates may be the best agents. For large-scale commercial operations producers will look directly to university researchers, government officials, and private consultants for technical advice.
Some aquaculture specialists have promoted a theory of development called the "oil drop" method to transfer aquaculture technology to countries without a history or tradition of culturing aquatic organisms. This method consists of constructing an infrastructure of fish culture stations which serve as demonstration, research, and seed production facilities. The basic concept is to practise fish culture techniques and hope that other farmers will emulate and spread the technology by word of mouth. The technology would then spread out from fish stations, like a drop of oil on water.
Table 4 provides information on the existence of and plans for developing training and/or demonstration centres for aquaculture. While this list is by no means complete or comprehensive it provides a picture of the importance of training and demonstration centres.

These centres are seen as particularly important in countries where aquaculture is a new technology and where fish does not constitute a major item in the consumer diet. In these cases the viability and feasibility of aquaculture must first be demonstrated. The assumption is that farmers will observe the success of the centres and begin to implement aquaculture technologies on-farm.
Critics of this system, however, say that it is an approach only concerned with building facilities which function just as long as external funding is available. When the external funding ends the host government is often unable to meet the costs of operating a major aquaculture facility, and it begins to deteriorate. They also state that the technology rarely expands outside the facility by passive osmosis. Transfer of aquaculture technology requires a sustained long-term effort working directly with farmers through the development of an efficient extension system. Simply having a demonstration fish culture station is not sufficient. It can be an effective component of a larger extension effort, but it is still only one component.
There is a constant temptation to turn these centres into full time research stations. Research investigators may actually hinder the development of a viable aquaculture industry by tying up scarce capital resources in research at the expense of extension and production efforts. Without farm production, it is difficult to convince government administrators of the value of research results which are small and long-range in nature.
Another approach to introducing aquaculture is to develop demonstrations with model farmers. In this approach the primary emphasis is placed on organizing an effective extension system through intensive training of extension agents, feedback from agents and farmers, and constant monitoring of progress. Fish culture stations, whether research or demonstration, are used as a supplement to extension efforts and not the reverse.
Most successful aquaculture programmes have used the latter approach. The final criterion for project success is farm production.

4.4.1 General considerations for aquaculture development in Africa and Latin America
Aquaculture was seen 20 years ago as the perfect solution to the growing protein shortage in much of Africa. Small subsistence ponds could be constructed by hand on marginal land, fish could be fed household and agricultural wastes, and even a small pond could substantially increase the dietary protein of a single rural family (Torrans, 1989). Unfortunately in only a few years many programmes collapsed and hundreds of ponds were abandoned.
Most programmes failed because they were based on single-pond subsistence farming operations. Ponds were constructed poorly, often with sandy soil or seasonal water, or were located great distances from the farmers' homes. Farmers received only superficial guidance in proper management, and production was consequently much lower than the farmers expected. Many ponds were so small that they could never produce a significant amount of fish even with good management.
In general group or institutional ponds did not work. In Tanzania some did work, but 90-95% of community, cooperative, and institutional ponds did not. No one wanted to feed, but everyone wanted to harvest. The only successful ones were those in which an individual took charge, but if that person left then the project fell apart.
Farmers were dependent upon the government for fingerlings. With only a single pond, they had to buy fingerlings for restocking once they drained their pond.
The new approach is the Zaïre model in which government§§stations produce the initial fingerlings, but encourage development of private fingerling producers. In order to have a successful independent industry, the technical management must employ appropriate technology and use resources available in the village or region. The use of outside fingerlings, feed, equipment, markets, or materials can result in a dangerous dependency on factors beyond the farmers' control, and should be avoided. Fish culture must result in yields of marketable fish which are great enough to reward a farmer adequately for his or her efforts.
Torrans (1989) listed a number of recommendations for successful tilapia production. For extension to be successful the production system being promoted must work. Ponds should be harvested twice a year to prevent stunting due to over-reproduction. However, it is often difficult to get farmers to harvest twice a year because (a) farmers believe that fish grow all the time and, given enough time, small fish will grow large, (b) farmers are reluctant to harvest a pond when the supply of fingerlings from a government station is uncertain, and (3) farmers often view their fish as "money in the bank". They can maximize production by harvesting each pond at six-month intervals. Fish should be grown only to the minimum size at which the entire crop can be sold locally with a fair profit to the farmer.
Many observations have been made on the current state of aquaculture extension in Africa. Among the most frequent are the following:
- Ponds which cannot be drained completely are unsuitable for tilapia culture, as they cannot be managed properly. As labour is cheap, most ponds in Africa are small enough to drain by hand and dry, and the small tilapia which are harvested can usually be sold.
- Farmers only learn by harvesting and seeing the effects of their management. It is therefore important for a farmer to own many ponds. Moreover, each pond represents a "bank account" to be harvested once a year. With many ponds, one can be harvested and the farmer still has others as bank accounts.
- As with many other activities, free gifts for the farmers are usually counterproductive. Many farmers feel that, if they wait long enough, the government will come to help them.
- Subsidized prices for fingerlings, while useful in the short-term, take potential profits away from private fingerling producers.
- It is important to promote the concept of maximum production and profits as the measure of a farmer's success, rather than fish size. Unfortunately in some agricultural shows awards are made for the largest fish displayed. These emotional rewards for producing a few large fish are often more important to a farmer than the tangible economic rewards of high production.
- Aquaculture projects have often been seen as ways to expand the budget of a particular institution. Often there is no concern over whether people like to eat fish or not. No target group is identified, but a general goal of "Let's get people to grow fish". Project success is measured by numbers of ponds and farmers.
- Extension agents are selected through politics and often are either not trained, poorly trained, or wrongly trained. Farmers do not trust agents who offer poor advice, and the extension agents themselves get readily discouraged if they are not accepted.
- The approach to extension often taken is to attempt to blanket the country. Consequently resources are taken from one area to disburse thinly nationwide, and the programme is evaluated on growth, not on sustained efforts.
4.4.2 Rwanda
After several fish culture extension efforts had failed in Rwanda, a new approach was initiated in 1982 which focused on intensive training and extension in addition to research.
The earlier projects failed primarily because they did not address the constraints, specifically the lack of inputs to fertilize the water, low air temperatures, lack of fingerlings, lack of technical know-how at the farmer level, and poorly selected and trained extension agents. Little effort was made to adapt fish culture technologies and extension programming to local conditions.
While the overall effort included both research and extension components, the research project was not operational until 1985, whereas the extension project began training extension agents in 1983. Feedback from extension agents to project administrators was an essential component of the new approach. Agents were trained in several standard tilapia culture techniques and encouraged to improve pond management to maximize the efficiency of the few inputs used. This played an important role in technology development. National directors continue to seek opinions and observations from farmers. The Fish Culture Extension Service helped identify appropriate aquaculture technologies by supervising a series of production or yield trials at various project-operated fish stations.
The extension methodology was based on the premise that, to ensure an effective transfer of ideas from agent to farmer, an intimate relationship must develop between the two. This can only happen if they are in frequent contact. Quality of the service was stressed in favour of quantity. Extension agents were instructed to spend highly constructive time with a few farmers and not become overextended by working with many people.
Agents worked in a zone with a 15 km radius, which they covered on bicycles. Within the zone the agent had to visit 10-15 sites. The zone was arranged so that the sites were situated on five major axes like the spokes of a wheel, with the agent's home as the hub. Each day of the week the agent travelled along one axis, and the schedule was repeated weekly, with the same axis being followed the same day of each week. Each axis was set out for the agent by the Extension Service so that it touched two or three sites where functioning fishponds were located.
Renovation of existing fish ponds was a prime objective, and an agent's schedule and programme was determined by the location of fish ponds in his or her zone. Often more than one fish pond was located in a given "marais", or wetland valley. Two or three marais could be visited on a given day (Moehl and Veverika, 1988).
One of the key elements of achieving the project's goal was to have qualified field personnel able to transfer appropriate technical knowlege to fish farmers to obtain the desired improved yields. A training service was established to train extension agents (or "moniteurs") and regional supervisors (or "agronomes"). A training center was constructed during the project at the National Fish Culture Center at Kigembe.
Agent training was not an isolated event but a continuous activity. The moniteurs were the foundation of the extension service and worked at the county level. They underwent a three-month applied technical training programme at Kigembe. The candidates were chosen from the prefecture where they were needed, and sent to Kigembe for training. Criteria for selecting trainees included: (a) verifiable residency in the area to which the agent was to be assigned after training; (b) completion of at least three years of post-primary education, and (c) passing an entrance test which ensured a basic level of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
Bürgermeisters of recipient communes were asked to propose two or three candidates, from which one would be selected. Each trainee was assigned a fishpond to manage during the course of the training programme. Trainees attended 2-3 day sessions, where they would visit exemplary rural fishponds and participate in coursework designed to expand their understanding of the basics of fish production. The training service distributed basic equipment which included a bicycle for transport, a backpack to carry equipment, and field materials, such as a minnow seine, dip net, spring scale, hand level, thermometer, and rubber boots.
Workshops played an important role in determining the efficiency of field staff. They provided technical guidance and allowed field personnel a chance to interact with administrative staff. By this means the "esprit de corps" created during training was sustained. Moniteurs were expected to participate in two workshops a year for the first two years they were in the field.
University graduates (agronomes) provided technical backstopping to the extension agents. Those who had received training elsewhere (such as in the FAO Training Center in Côte d'Ivoire) received country-specific orientation upon their return. Caucuses for regional agronomes were given periodically to encourage an exchange of ideas, and to inform them of new techniques or developments. Short courses for project station managers were given to upgrade and standardize technical levels, and to coordinate techniques with other stations. Field workers were given short courses in pond construction. Seminars were held for government officials, administrators, and technicians to present principles of aquaculture.
The extension service in Rwanda has been concerned primarily with regulating the growth of the aquaculture industry, rather than achieve dramatic expansion. Exceedingly rapid growth has probably contributed to the demise of many extension programme in other countries.
4.4.3 Zaïre
The Peace Corps Fisheries Project in Zaïre began in 1975, with early funding from Oxford Famine Relief, or OXFAM (Morrison, 1988). The original goals were to develop a core of self-reliant, progressive fish farmers who would derive a regular income from raising fish. The theory was that a long-term continuous extension effort by Peace Corps Volunteers would produce autonomous, self-sufficient farmers. The objective was to create an organized, efficient, and cohesive group of fish farmers who worked together to tackle common issues and problems.
In the early years incentives for participation were offered, such as the provision of wheelbarrows, shovels, and picks, but later such gifts were discontinued. Project buttons were distributed, and served the important function of identifying progressive project farmers without creating a sense of dependency. It was also decided to standardize the extension methodology to prevent duplication of effort, and to facilitate subsequent evaluation.
Social criteria established for location of Volunteers included the interest of the local population, and the population density in the area. Technical criteria for site selection included privately owned land for farm construction, a year-round supply of good quality water, soil with an adequate clay content for making ponds, and suitable drainage. The area also had to be readily accessible, and capable of supporting Volunteers.
It was estimated that it required a minimum of six years of Volunteer time and inputs to achieve the goals of the project. As each Volunteer has two years of service this required three Volunteers per area.
The emphases of the project were community animation, active promotion, and involving as many interested people as possible. The key was to identify dynamic individuals who had greater potential for success than the average villager. These lead fish farmers were groomed to become counterparts to the Volunteer on an informal and voluntary basis. They were to be role models and, by their example, encourage others to join the project and to farm. It was intended also that they would form the core of a fish farmer association in the area.
It was important that, in the shortest time possible, the Volunteer trained the leaders to function well enough to use them for the benefit of others. This was to be achieved by visual demonstration, as it is more effective than oral or written presentations. These experienced lead fish farmers were more effective in transferring fish farming technology than either the Peace Corps Volunteers or through written educational materials (United States Agency for International Development, 1988).
The plan of the project was that the first Volunteer spent two years making as many contacts as possible, identifying promising sites, constructing and stocking ponds, introducing intensive management techniques, and getting a number of farmers well established. The typical work day of the Volunteer was 6-8 hours on the road visiting perhaps 2 or 3 farmers. The second volunteer at the post continued to make new contacts and conducted site inspections, but the major focus became the management of existing ponds. During this period modern intensive techniques and the importance of good record keeping were stressed. Most farmers lacked formal education and, for this reason, methods were kept simple.
With each harvest increasing emphasis was placed on profitability and cost efficiency of fish farming. Group development was also stressed so that eventually it led to the formation of farmer associations, and a sense of identity with other fish farmers. Villages which had several years of Volunteer input had large numbers of project farmers formed into "Fish Farmers Associations" (United States Embassy, 1984). Member farmers also sold fingerlings to each other and to non-project farmers, and were encouraged to provide technical assistance to other farmers.
Emphasis on group formation did not begin suddenly. From the beginning Volunteers used farmers as models and teachers in numerous seminars, meetings, and field trips before any mention of forming a group. Through this process farmers became acquainted and then relied upon each other for advice and assistance. A sense of trust and common cause developed. The fish farmer associations were encouraged to become independent of continuous outside advice and material inputs. The result was a local private infrastructure to take over the Volunteer's responsibilities when the Peace Corps post was finally dropped. This programme in Zaïre is the first in Africa to produce farmers with this level of expertise.
There was no risk to the farmer by joining the association. Unlike some cooperatives there was no money involved and no cause for jealousy. Cash or equipment subsidies have often resulted in divisive conflicts. The associations were formed to meet individual needs for fish, and to provide encouragement, advice, and protection against theft and extortion.
Formal farmer training sessions began when farmer associations were formed and meeting. These sessions were led by nationals, with Volunteers taking a passive role. A positive result of these sessions was an improvement in each farmer's self-image and motivation. Training sessions of a shorter duration were organized in villages, held in the local church or schoolhouse, and visits were made to pond sites near the village.
The third Volunteer applied the finishing touches to construction activities and focused more intensively on record keeping and continuity of the association. Many opportunities were provided for farmers to visit research and demonstration fish stations, as training was a continuous process to provide each farmer with the necessary expertise. During the final two years before a post became autonomous, the Volunteer became more of a contributor than an organizer of functions of the association, and the direction was gradually handed over to the farmers themselves.
Peace Corps/Zaïre has been funded by grants from USAID. Regional farmer training stations have been constructed in all five regions serving as model farms. All sessions were conducted in the local languages. A recent addition was the creation of a mobile extension team (Equipe Mobile), which made visits to farmer asociations on a bimonthly basis. The Equipe Mobile presented "leadership seminars" to advanced Volunteer posts to help farmers organize themselves into associations, as they provide the most effective support mechanisms. Bimonthly newsletters in the local language were sent to project farmers to inform them of project activities and important events.
Factors which accounted for the success of the Peace Corps/Zaïre project included: (a) self-motivation, and access to land, tools, and labour by participant farmers, (b) restriction of the Volunteer to technical and not material assistance, and (c) simplicity and low cost of equipment which made it an activity accessible to all.
The Zaïre project demonstrated that a large government bureaucracy was not necessary for development to occur. By focusing on the individual farmer, a system was developed by which most services normally provided by the public sector were provided by farmers and their associations. Fingerlings were produced and distributed locally; experienced farmers advised new farmers on site selection, construction, and management; and farmers met regularly as a group to discuss management issues and problems (Bossard, 1987).
4.4.4 Liberia
Government fishery services in Liberia are undertaken by the Fishery Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. The nucleus of the Inland Fisheries Section is the Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI) at Suakoko, where a fish farming research and extension centre was established in 1952.
The Liberian extension programme began much like fisheries programmes in other countries. Peace Corps Volunteers and Liberian technicians covered large areas of the country trying to work with farmers who were interested. The drive was to build ponds to introduce fish culture to as many people as possible. Fingerlings of tilapia for stocking and restocking initially came from CARI at Suakoko, and later from hatcheries built in Lofa and Nimba Counties. The Inland Fisheries and Marine Fisheries Sections of the Division were subsequently established to conduct supporting research. However, this approach met with little success. Few farmers built a second pond, and many project farms were abandoned.
A new approach to fish culture extension began with the Nimba County Rural Development Project (NCRDP) in 1979 (Beck, 1986). The project, which was supported by the Government of Liberia and the Federal Republic of Germany, was conceived as a multisectoral integrated approach to development. The pilot project in fish culture began as a component of a larger agriculture development programme.
The project objectives were to increase rural fish supply and to improve rural cash income. The outputs included training farmers and extensionists, providing extension and advisory services, and establishing district fish hatcheries. The beneficiaries of the project were rural communities of noncoastal counties in the hinterland (Ministry of Agriculture, 1979).
Extension and advisory services were delivered jointly by the NCRDP Agricultural Extension and Training Section and the Peace Corps/Liberia. The project was administered by the counterpart senior fisheries officer. The extension programme in Liberia was based on the six-year cycle tested in Zaïre (see 4.4.3).
In the project Volunteers worked with less than ten farmers each. The task was to develop small fish farms made up of several large ponds, rather than work with many farmers and their isolated small ponds as in the past. A core of successful independent fish farmers was to be developed which would serve as a nucleus for future growth of the industry.
The extension programme was designed around support for clusters of farmers within reasonable distance, as it was anticipated that several farmers within an area would give each other moral support, fingerlings, advice, and physical help with construction and harvesting. Friendly competition also encouraged better management and production.
Material (but not technical) support was gradually withdrawn. Fish hatcheries built and operated by NCRDP were turned over to private individuals. While government ponds usually are necessary to begin an extension programme, continued operation of government ponds as fingerling sources in many countries generally resulted in financial losses which tended to retard development of a fish farming industry.
Emphasis was placed on multiple-pond production systems which constituted an economically viable production unit. It was found that if pond harvests did not constitute a significant percentage of farm income then labour was diverted to other farm activities. Farmers in Liberia treated multiple pond systems as a productive farming enterprise, whereas a single pond was only considered to be a "living bank account".
Criteria for the selection of project farmers in Liberia included:
(a) Non-traditional farmers with some prior format training in agriculture.
(b) Farmers who had developed swamp rice and had located on the farm. The work of clearing swamp and forming paddies, and controlling water, were all experiences which provided a sound basis for fish farming. If the farmer did not reside on the farm then it was unlikely that ponds received the management attention required to produce acceptable crops.
(c) Capital was available to hire workers for pond construction.
(d) The farm had a diversity of crops, such as cash crops as well as traditional food crops.
(e) Practical experience with livestock.
(f) The farm was located near a town, for proximity of feed (rice bran), labour for construction, and markets for fish. The emphasis of the project was on fish production directed at markets rather than autoconsumption (subsistence).
(g) The farm ponds had a year-round water source.
(h) The topography and soil were suitable for a multi-pond system, and there was room for expansion.
One excellent practice of the project was the utilization of good farmers to communicate technology and information to other farmers in the local language. These lead farmers were much more effective than Volunteers or other technicians.
4.4.5 Panama
The overall Panamanian strategy has been to demonstrate the importance and potential of aquaculture systems in Panama through implementing viable production systems on private and community fish ponds. Technologies were selected based on technical, biological, economic, and cultural feasibility.
In light of the urgent need to reduce malnutrition in rural Panama, existing culture technologies were selected which could be readily implemented. The emphasis was on developing farm production as quickly as possible before initiating research on native species. Some Latin American nations, such as Colombia, regulate the introduction of exotic species to avoid endangering native species, and have adopted policies of developing technologies to culture indigenous species. The basic research required for the culture of native species, however, is expensive and time-consuming, as little has been done before.
Panama's policies placed greater importance on development of rural communities than on preservation of natural resources. Introductions were made of tilapias (Tilapia spp.), Chinese carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis, and Ctenopharyngodon idellus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii).
Traditional crop and livestock systems in Panama were complemented, not replaced, by the new technologies introduced. Rural ponds (150-300 m^2) were stocked in polyculture systems which varied according to interests of farmers and specific site characteristics. The systems were designed to meet their needs of improved nutrition. The projects were located in inland areas without access to seafood, where inexpensive animal protein was lacking, and where the inhabitants suffered from protein malnutrition.
As it is known that technologies which increase yields but are risky may not be attractive to small-scale farmers, who are generally averse to taking risks (Scott, 1976), the projects were designed to minimize production risk by diversifying the types of economic activities undertaken (Lovshin et al., 1986). This also helped to avoid fluctuating yields from year to year, which is known to conflict with the needs of small-scale farmers to provide continuous subsistence to the family (Morss et al., 1976).
Fish production in larger ponds (greater than 300 m^2) was integrated with livestock husbandry, so that cattle, hog, chicken, or duck manure fertilized the pond daily to support productivity. This reduced the need for cash purchases of chemical fertilizers and other inputs. Traditional crops of bananas, yucca, oté, and name, and other nontraditional fruit and vegetable crops, were irrigated with pond water.
These integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems focused on harvesting water for multiple on-farm uses. The water storage capacity of the fish pond provided significant benefits to farm production and well-being of the family. In addition to being a source of fish, the ponds provided a control against land erosion, a reservoir of water for irrigation of horticultural crops, and a source of water for animal and poultry husbandry.
An economic analysis of the project indicated that the net returns for the integrated chicken-fish, hog-fish, and cattle-fish combinations contributed positively to net farm income (Hatch and Engle, 1987). Fish produced in association with ducks achieved the highest rates of return to aquaculture production (23%), followed by chickens (14%), hogs (13%), and cattle (9%). The returns for fish-ducks, fish-chickens, and fish-hogs are all above the 12% established as the opportunity cost of capital in Panama.
Although the original focus of the project was the semi-subsistence sector, efforts were made to encourage commercial production of freshwater fish. Analysis of freshwater shrimp, tilapia, and colossoma (Colossoma macropomum) production in monoculture and polyculture on a commercial scale indicated that all systems were profitable. Rates of return before financing ranged from 3-23%, and 9-17% after financing (Engle, 1987a). Net returns per hectare of water ranged from US$ 644-3 291. The polyculture systems were consistently more profitable than monoculture.
Before 1976 the Republic of Panama had a total of 7 freshwater fishponds. By the end of 1984 the number had Increased to 566. Freshwater ponds have been constructed in all nine provinces of Panama, and include subsistence, commercial, and semi-commercial enterprises (Engle, 1985).
In Panama local farmers were involved in project development, beginning with the initial search for project sites. In the early years of the project, extension agents initiated contacts with people in communities which had potential resources. The agents presented talks and slide shows to local residents of selected communities to explain aquaculture, and its benefits and requirements. As the aquaculture project expanded and became more well known, interested communities initiated contacts with extension agents. Any decision to undertake a project was made jointly by farmers and extension agents. Farmers participated in the construction of ponds, and in the selection of livestock, feeds, and fertilizers. The farmers had total responsibility for the organization of local groups, and scheduling harvests and maintenance activities. This substantial involvement by the farmers themselves played an important role in the rapid transfer of aquaculture technology which took place
(Morss and Gow, 1985).
A prime strategy of the extension programme in Panama was the training of middle-level personnel to strengthen the extension/technology transfer component of the project (Lovshin and Pretto, 1983). On-the-job-training has been essential in developing junior-level expertise. Many Panamanian aquaculture extension personnel have gained the greater part of their knowledge from practical experience in the field working with fish, pond systems, and farmers to develop their skills, albeit by trial and error. While this type of training may be criticized as inefficient, in-country training produced greater numbers of active personnel, and training was carried out under local conditions with locally available materials. Time was not lost in experimental application of principles developed in countries under different conditions.
In 1979 a university course for aquaculture extension technicians was initiated at the regional centre of the University of Panama in the Province of Veraguas. The course was based on a 2.5-year curriculum directed by aquaculture personnel of the Ministry of Agriculture. On completion of the course all 20 graduates were employed as aquaculture extension officers in the National Directorate of Aquaculture.
Subsequent courses and workshops have included postgraduates, extension workers, and farmers. This emphasis on education and training has created a staff of well-trained and Capable middle-level technicians in the country. While most Latin American countries have national aquaculture programmes with about 20-30 trained aquaculture technicians, Panama has 146 trained personnel in the National Aquaculture Directorate. Scholarships for advanced degrees were not sought until the national programme of Panama had reached a critical mass in terms of producers, extension agents and other middle-level personnel, and infrastructure.
The approach in Panama has been to use extension personnel in conjunction with farmers in farming systems research. Both farmers and extension agents increased their knowledge and experience together, as well as increased marketable production.

5.1 Selection of Extension Agents
5.2 Specific Techniques of Extension
5.1 Selection of Extension Agents
Criteria for selection of extension agents vary from country to country. In many countries a university-level education is required for extension work.
In others, "promotores", "moniteurs", or "link workers" are trained by extension agents to work on a nearly daily basis with producers. These types of extension personnel often have little education, perhaps a level only slightly above the level of the average population.
It is widely assumed that the higher the level of education of extension personnel the better for the service. However, university-trained personnel are scarce in many countries and in great demand, and their qualifications command higher salaries in occupations other than the government extension service. Moreover, university-trained personnel may consider it a demotion to be assigned to a job which requires frequent travel to rural areas. After receiving a university education, the general expectation of graduates is an office job which does not require physical hardships of the type experienced by extension personnel.
Different target groups require different types of extension agents. The problems of the large commercial producers predominantly centre around market development for new aquaculture products. Such commercial operations, usually privately owned by wealthy individuals, need well educated and technically trained extension agents. However, good agents, with a college degree and often experience and special training in the USA or Japan, are most frequently hired directly by the private sector. This puts a drain on the work and service of the public sector. Subsistence operators, on the other hand, require a local person familiar with local conditions and farming practices. In these cases the link worker, promotore, or moniteur system works best.
In the survey, eight respondents indicated that a university degree was necessary to be selected as an extension agent (Table 5), namely Cameroon, Zaïre, Jordan, Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, Panama, and Peru. The remaining programmes required some type of post-primary educational level, such as vocational training. One respondent mentioned the need for the agent to be a community leader.
The heart of any extension programme is personal contact between farmer and agent. Yet selection of extension agents focuses primarily on academic education levels. Little regard is given to communication and social skills of individuals selected. Only three respondents (Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and Thailand) mentioned any type of extension agent training, yet extension agents need constant and quality training beyond their academic education. It is presumed that specialized training is generally not available for aquaculture extension agents. An agent who is confident in his or her abilities and knowledge will not be afraid to meet with farmers and deal with their questions and problems. Extension personnel who have not been properly trained may justly feel inadequate and insecure in their knowledge, and shy away from contact with farmers. Similarly, inadequately trained agents may cause a great deal of damage by giving wrong recommendations to farmers. A poorly trained extension
agent may come to be regarded as a nuisance by the farmers, or a pest.

(*) Only two countries required particular language skills; Rwanda (French) and Guatemala (local language).
In systems where link workers, promotores, or moniteurs are used, the problem of providing incentives to reside in rural areas is removed when they are selected from rural areas targeted by a programme. They already live in the area, and are known by neighbours and relatives. The obvious advantage of this practice, if applied properly, is that there are few problems with acceptance in the community, language, and culture. On the other hand, as these individuals have a low educational level, and little or no experience in aquaculture, considerable effort must be expended in training and supervision.
In these cases extension personnel work primarily with link workers and not directly with producers. For example, the Fisherwomen Extension Service of the Department of Fisheries in Tamil Nadu developed a programme to train link workers to serve as liaisons between fisherwomen and government officers and institutions (Drewes, 1980 and 1985). Specific functions of these link workers were to (a) mobilize fisherwomen for constructive group action, (b) improve their social and economic conditions, (c) create understanding of needs for change in socio-cultural attitudes among men and women, (d) encourage women to utilize services of governments and other institutions, and (e) stimulate government institutions to respond to objectives and needs of target groups. Women trainees were selected based on their literacy, marital status (married below the age of 40), acceptance by all women in the village, willingness to participate in residential training courses, awareness that
training did not guarantee employment, and willingness and interest to work with groups of women.
Twenty-three women participated in the 10-week course. Participants were trained in the basics of group dynamics. Field visits were organized and the residential training was followed by two months of on-the-job training. Link workers assisted individual women in determining their most urgent needs, identified means of meeting these needs, and registered cooperative societies of fisherwomen. The Department of Fisheries provided continuous close support through the Fisherwomen Extension Service. As a result of this project, more than 250 women from five villages received loans of 200-500 Indian Rupees each at 4X interest. Some cooperatives started savings deposits and others joined educational programmes.
Another type of link worker extension system is the U.S. Peace Corps/CARE aquaculture project in Guatemala. Initiated in 1982, it has worked in 21 municipalities in 9 departments in eastern and northern Guatemala, in rural areas characterized by scarce economic resources. The principal objective of the project was to supplement the family diet with fish, and a secondary objective was to generate income.
Fish ponds were constructed by the father of the family, but daily management was carried out by women and children. Women, with sole responsibility for the diet of the family, enjoyed having an additional source of protein close at hand. Approximately 500-600 ponds were constructed, of average size 100-200 m^2. Volunteers trained local counterparts who then translated during educational sessions. Team work was emphasized, which involved a division of labour along traditional lines prevalent in the communities.
The most successful field extension personnel are individuals who speak the local language, understand local agriculture, farming, and culture, and who win the confidence of the rural people they are sent to serve. The most effective extension agents are those who are able to relate and communicate with farm families in the rural community. Field level extension personnel should be as similar as possible to the rural people they will serve in language, culture, and religion. However, only Rwanda and Guatemala, of the survey respondents, have any language requirements (see Table 5). In Rwanda extension agents are required to speak French, whereas in Guatemala they must be fluent in the local language. But unless extension personnel are better trained they will not be respected, or have anything better to teach. If they always remain in their home areas, any programme may become dominated by members of a social and economic elite of the area (Axinn, 1988).
Traditionally, extension workers have been predominantly male (Engle, 1987b). In recent years it has become clear that much of the work of aquaculture is done by women. Consequently the work of male extension agents, who arrive in a community and invariably train and transmit technology to men, is misplaced, as women are involved in the day-to-day management of fish ponds. Managers of credit programmes have also discovered that failure to involve women in the loan negotiation process in Asian countries (where women manage household finances) can have disastrous results in terms of loan default rates. The Asian Development Bank discovered that by including women in the loan negotiation process the rate of loan defaults was dramatically reduced (Hourihan, 1986).
In general the survey respondents indicated no preference for one sex or the other for extension agent positions (see Table 5). Ecuador was the only respondent who indicated that only males would qualify for extension positions.
Racial or cultural considerations are also important at times. If an extension programme is designed to work with persons in a low economic order and with limited resources, there may be different racial and cultural backgrounds. Such differences make it difficult for an extension agent of different race or culture to develop the trust and confidence necessary for an effective farmer relationship. Often typical patterns of oppression of minority races or cultures augment these problems. Yet these minority races or cultures will have few, if any, representatives educated at the level required by most extension services. In these circumstances the link worker system functions well to bridge possible differences in education and culture.
Some extension systems are based on hiring personnel trained specifically in aquaculture, while others use agriculture generalists as extension agents. Others use a combination of the two. Specialized aquaculture personnel are often scarce, particularly in countries which are developing new aquaculture industries. But the greatest need for well-trained personnel is in countries with incipient industries where there is little information and no strong base of experience among producers.
In systems which rely on specially-trained aquaculture specialists, the tendency has been to develop totally separate aquaculture extension services. Agriculture generalists can respond to a large number of different agricultural problems with one trip in one vehicle. Special services require several trips and vehicles to the same area, using fuel and duplicating equipment in areas where these and vehicle maintenance are costly and difficult to arrange. The most adequate solution may be some combination of the two, namely specialized aquaculturists who work with agriculture generalists for training, and responding to particular problems. Thus their collective training and experience is spread over a wider area.
The majority of respondents (71%) required specialists in aquaculture for extension positions (see Table 5). This emphasis was not specific to any one region. At least one respondent in each region used general agriculturists as aquaculture extension agents.
Extension programmes designed to implement production strategies based on integration of animal husbandry and agronomy with fish culture require extension agents experienced with various crops, livestock, and even forestry enterprises. Integrated agriculture-aquaculture technology requires extension agents to be agriculture generalists with perhaps intensive short-term technical training in aspects most critical to the success of the local system (Gutierrez, 1986; Pretto, 1985).
Some countries use extension agents trained as agronomists, and others hire primarily biologists. The perspectives adopted by people with these respective technical backgrounds are, however, quite different. Agronomists are trained in soil science and agricultural production. They are taught principles of fertilization, liming, herbicide and pesticide treatment, but generally do not receive training in basic biology of aquatic organisms. As many aquatic organisms rely on food from natural sources, training in these areas is very useful.
Extensionists trained as biologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biological cycles, food webs, and more esoteric biological issues than production of food. This can be a problem when dealing with farmers who are primarily concerned with food production, and not interested in relationships between different food niches or preserving native species.
Aquaculture is sometimes confused with ecology and can be a hobby of the educated elite. It may be a fad for some who, with little knowledge or practical experience, seek to inflict this on subsistence producers. Some host country nationals return from overseas with a post-graduate degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) obtained through further education and research. Their programme of study probably included little practical production experience. Without such practical fish culture skills, they are invariably poorly prepared to guide an extension programme, and provide pragmatic and useful recommendations.
5.2 Specific Techniques of Extension
Extension techniques have been developed in many countries over the last 50 years. Recognized extension techniques include training and visit, demonstration farm projects, producers' meetings, educational materials, and use of mass media.
Extension activities must be multi-media to direct the process of technological change and development effectively. However, not all techniques are appropriate for all countries and situations. Tables 6-9 present information from the survey on respondents' perceptions of the most appropriate extension techniques for cooperatives, private producers, commercial producers, and for subsistence producers.

(*) Interchange of information between farmers, neighbours, and communities
The training and visit system is one of the most widely utilized of all extension techniques. It consists of training sessions for producers to introduce specific technologies and techniques which are then followed by farm visits to observe their implementation and outcome. The training session can take a number of forms, including producers' meetings, conferences, workshops, and method demonstrations. This has been one of the important models of extension methodologies used. The training and visit system was widely accepted by survey respondents as an appropriate extension technique for cooperatives, private producers, and subsistence producers.
Demonstration farm projects have been successfully used by many countries. They incorporate two main attributes, namely they recognize the importance of demonstrated success of any new technique and its subsequent adoption by farmers, and the importance of farmer-to-farmer communication. A technology, which has been successfully developed by researchers to the point where there is good potential for success on the farm, is selected for implementation on a cooperator's farm. The cooperator is selected on his or her willingness to devote space and time to the activity, and with resources to meet particular requirements of the new technology. Implementation of a new technology on a farm in an area with favourable conditions demonstrates to the local producers the viability and potential benefits to be derived from it. Demonstration farms were mentioned by most respondents for all types of producers, and were regarded as one of the most useful extension methodologies.
Producers' meetings are important techniques used by extensionists. They provide a mechanism to transfer information to a group of producers at one time. They also provide a mechanism for mutual support and interchange of ideas among producers.
For work with cooperatives, producers' meetings were often selected by respondents from Africa (Cameroon, Rwanda, Zaïre, and Zimbabwe) and Asia (Philippines and Thailand), but in Latin America only Panama used meetings with cooperatives (see Table 6). Educational materials and mass media were widely used for work with cooperatives. Rwanda also takes advantage of farmer-to-farmer communications for extension work with cooperatives.
Meetings were more often selected by respondents from Latin America for private producers than for cooperatives (see Table 7). Both educational materials and mass media were recommended, as well as farmer-to-farmer interactions in Rwanda. Guatemala also indicated that the extension programme makes considerable use of exchanging information at farmer, neighbour, and community levels.
Demonstration farms and meetings were seen as most important for working with commercial producers (see Table 8). However, African respondents were less enthusiastic about demonstration farms for commercial producers, and they were used only in Rwanda.
Educational materials are essential to add an additional element to extension efforts. Newsletters, bulletins, fact sheets, and pamphlets can be passed or mailed to producers without farm visits, and can be used to reinforce information presented at producers' meetings or through farm visits. In societies with a high rate of illiteracy, educational materials must be designed carefully with illustrations which convey information without relying extensively on text.
Availability of simple written manuals and audiovisuals are important in any extension programme (Pretto, 1985). A series of manuals on the following subjects is recommended: fish pond construction, inorganic and organic fertilization of ponds, stocking and culture of fish species in ponds, fish pond management, economic aspects of fish culture, reproduction of freshwater organisms for their culture in ponds, fish health, prevention and cure of parasites and diseases, and preparation of aquaculture products. These manuals should be based completely on experiences within the country.
Mass media techniques can be used effectively in almost all countries. In countries with high rates of illiteracy, radio announcements can be extremely effective, and television is becoming an increasingly important means of communication.
For subsistence producers respondents indicated Intense efforts in all categories (see Table 9). This is perhaps implicit recognition of the difficulties working with subsistence farmers, and the need to devote many resources and many different techniques to the process.

6. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF EXTENSION SERVICE
6.1 Extension Roles of Different Institutions
6.2 Linkages Between Extension and Research Efforts
Organization and management play an important role in aquaculture development (Pollnac, 1985). The organizational structure of an extension service plays a large role in what types of extension activities are carried out, how they are carried out, and the recipient target groups and beneficiaries of extension. This chapter presents the different institutional roles in extension, and discusses linkages between institutions, and between extension and research. Annex II illustrates organizational structures of typical aquaculture extension programmes, and these are described further by Chakroff (1982).
There are two dominant approaches to the organization of extension services. The first identifies one particular institution devoted solely to extension, the second identifies an agricultural development organization with responsibilities for research, marketing, and extension (Axinn, 1988). A further policy issue for consideration is whether to separate organizations dealing with different sub-sectors involved in production, such as crops, livestock, fruit, vegetables, fisheries, and forestry, and even youth development and family life. It is known that the more specialized the individuals or groups, the higher the cost of effective communication and cooperation between them. However, agriculture is a highly technical multi-faceted field which often requires many kinds of specialized personnel in addition to generalists who comprehend whole farming systems (Axinn, 1988).
Regardless of the type of organizational structure, the principal factor which determines the success of any extension programme is the degree to which any specific project is adopted and supported by the target population. "Interventions which fail to sustain support and sponsorship within the national bureaucracy are destined to wither and dissipate. Production schemes which fail to win the confidence and enthusiasm of farmers will not generate food or revenue." (Molnar and Duncan, 1989).
6.1 Extension Roles of Different Institutions
The primary responsibility for aquaculture extension in most countries lies with some government agency. The particular agency concerned varies greatly from country to country, and invariably generates a certain amount of controversy and competition. In some countries different agencies operate aquaculture extension, and their services may or may not be coordinated.
The majority of countries for which information is available indicates that the Ministry of Agriculture is predominantly responsible for aquaculture extension. In the survey (see Table 10), seven respondents in Asia and Latin America (Bangladesh, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) indicated that the primary agency for aquaculture extension was a ministry responsible for fisheries or a fisheries institute. Two African (Tanzania and Zimbabwe) and two Latin American respondents (Colombia and Honduras) indicated that it was a ministry of natural resources. Other countries (Kenya, Madagascar, Zaïre, and Singapore) had aquaculture extension services located in ministerial departments of rural or national development; environment, conservation and tourism; tourism and wildlife; or commerce and industry.
In a typical agricultural ministry aquaculture extension agents tend to be trained in agronomy, and may or may not have specific training in aquaculture. Extension personnel are more likely to combine activities in aquaculture with those in other types of agriculture. Farmers are therefore targeted for technology transfer of aquaculture as well as technologies of agriculture. Thus there is greater potential for extension work with farming systems, such as integrated livestock-fish production and management of water resources for other agricultural activities.
In cases where responsibility for aquaculture extension is within an agency for natural resources, there is a likelihood that the aquaculture extension agents are also used for functions such as game/fishing licensing, regulatory work, and enforcement. Agencies which have emphasis on natural resource management also produce and monitor restrictions on the introduction of exotic species, and promote proven cultured species, or focus research on development of culture methods for native species. Thus their overall emphasis is often on preserving natural resources, and not commercial production or exploitation for home consumption.
Countries which have important capture fisheries industries tend to place responsibilities for aquaculture extension in a fisheries agency. Combining aquaculture with fisheries often results in agents for extension work hired for their biological backgrounds, rather than agronomy, and the emphasis of their work tends to be biological processes rather than production. Moreover, target groups are more often fishermen than farmers, and extension efforts are directed at fishing cooperatives to encourage them to change from fishing to fish farming. The obvious advantage of this institutional approach is that the marketing structure and traditions for handling fish are in place. The disadvantage is that work habits of fishermen, accustomed to working only certain times of the year or certain times of day, conflict strongly with habits of successful farmers who continuously manage and monitor their farms or fish ponds all day long. The literature indicates that there have been few
successful attempts to convert fishermen into fish farmers.

Mexico is a country where aquaculture extension is handled by a fisheries ministry. The General Directorate of Aquaculture of the Secretaría de Pesca has the following responsibilities:
- formulate policies and programmes of aquacultural production,
- promote the creation and organization of aquaculture production and distribution units,
- promote the construction and operation of laboratories and aquaculture units dedicated to aquaculture production,
- formulate programmes of financial support,
- formulate policies and programmes of repopulation of national waters,
- define techniques of aquaculture administration and management,
- generate employment,
- propose and promote national production of industrialized foods consumed by aquatic organisms,
- supervise and control the distribution of aquatic organisms,
- propose to the administrative units the construction, acquisition, conservation, and maintenance of facilities and equipment,
- propose scientific and technological research destined to support the development of aquaculture, and
- emit technical advice upon, and supervise the import and export of aquatic organisms.
Universities in many countries are involved in aquaculture extension. Generally their services are smaller and not as comprehensive as their government counterparts for lack of resources. University extension services may or may not coordinate their activities with government agencies. In cases where they do, universities play an extremely important role in training extension agents, "link workers", and producers. Universities may also have research activities in aquaculture which generate technologies which can be transferred to producers directly and quickly.
Peru is one example where a university is taking the lead in national aquaculture development. The Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, the Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura (IVITA), the Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, the Corporacion Departamental de Ucayali, and the Gerencia de Promocion, Desarrollo y Finanzas, developed an agreement to conduct a fish culture project in Peru (Gutierrez, 1986). The general objective of the project was to develop improved fish production systems in ponds which were appropriate to typical Amazon conditions, taking into consideration farmers' preferences and their limited resources, and the environment.
The project was established to (1) evaluate existing fish production systems, specifically water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, land use systems, technology, demand, incentives and constraints to technological changes, (2) develop technological alternatives for different components of fish production systems, (3) evaluate, under farm conditions, pond fish yield, (4) promote collaboration between research and extension officers to develop a continuous process of generation and transfer of technology, and (5) train Peruvian scientists in fish culture research methodology.
A demonstration module was established at IVITA. Production techniques concentrated on broodstock management and seed production for the "colonos", or tenant farmers. The approach was to establish a fish station at the university where fish stocks would be maintained, and which would be a focal point for training and demonstration. Later, a pilot extension programme would be developed based on establishing micro-demonstration units on farms. It would include training of farmers, demonstrating methods and techniques, and establishing production modules.
The project focused on small ponds, for ease of management, and Tilapia nilotica was selected as the principal fish species to be produced. Integrated aquaculture-agriculture modules were also included (Lovshin et al., 1986), with batteries of four ponds established with fish-pig and fish-duck systems.
For the design of the extension programme a survey was carried out to identify any social factors which would affect the project. The survey identified factors such as other enterprises on the farm, resources available for fish culture, levels of previous experience or interest in fish culture, and economic and financial limitations. The project evaluation indicated the need to have specific and well-defined goals for project participants. The survey indicated that fish culture for home consumption was most appropriate, but this could possibly lead to subsequent commercialization.
All farmers who had previous experience with IVITA projects (nonfish projects) indicated, when interviewed, that they would like to raise fish (Gutierrez, 1986). This positive previous experience with the implementing agency obviously pre-disposed the farmers to believe in the project and thus to work hard to ensure its success.
Military institutions in many countries can play roles in extension. In various Latin American countries, notably Panama and Nicaragua, the military has civic action programmes which actively participate in constructing fish ponds, as well as roads, bridges, and schools. In general extension provided by the military is not formally linked to other national extension activities, but often national extension agents request specific help from military institutions in the form of the loan of heavy equipment.
Private voluntary agencies and organizations are playing an increasingly important role in aquaculture extension in many countries. Such institutions are CARE, the International Confederation of Catholic Organizations for Charitable and Social Action (CARITAS Internationalis), Heifer Project, Winrock International, and many others. Their typical approach is small-scale and grass-roots oriented, with significant inputs from local producers at various stages of projects. In general, "promotores" are recruited and trained to work directly with a certain number of farmers.
Agencies of foreign governments, which provide bilateral technical assistance, also provide useful aquaculture extension services in many of their projects. These foreign government agencies generally train their own personnel who then work through a host country institution with host-country counterparts in extension activities. For example, United States of America has the Agency for International Development (US AID) and Peace Corps, and other countries, such as Norway (Norwegian Agency for International Development, or NORAD), Sweden (Swedish International Development Authority, or SIDA), France, Federal Republic of Germany (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH, or GTZ), Italy, Japan (Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA), United Kingdom (Overseas Development Administration, or ODA), among others, send technical advisors and volunteers who work in some type of extension-related activities. Invariably these individuals have high levels of
education and/or important practical and technical skills useful in many countries. Problems arise, however, from language and cultural barriers, and sometimes through introducing technologies and institutional or organizational structures not well adapted to host-country conditions.
Foreign assistance agencies may also have different priorities and criteria for designing and implementing projects. The national goals for a particular project and those of the bilateral agency may be in conflict, and the policies of an agency may differ widely depending on the policies of its respective government in power. Thus, individual projects which overlap different political administrations may be designed under the first with certain goals and objectives but then evaluated under a second administration, with vastly different criteria, policies, and objectives.
Multilateral organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), among others, include aquaculture extension in many of their projects. FAO, for example, through the financial support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and bilateral agencies, has established a number of regional and national training centres for aquaculture technicians. It also executes projects which provide technical assistance directly to host-country agencies involved in aquaculture extension, or projects which have a significant extension component. These activities have similar advantages and disadvantages to those of foreign country agencies, noted above.
Middle-level technical training programmes in aquaculture are conducted or supported financially by many international organizations (such as FAO); international and national agencies (such as the International Research and Development Centre, or IDRC; the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, or SEAFDEC-AQD; and the National Inland Fisheries Institute of Thailand, or NIFI); non-governmental organizations (such as CARE, Lutheran World Service, Catholic Relief Services, and Heifer Project International); universities (such as Auburn University and the University of Rhode Island, in the USA); and aquaculture/fisheries institutes (such as the Freshwater Fisheries Research Centre, Wuxi, China, and the Leetown Center of the Fish and Wildlife Service, USA), (Engle, 1987b).
6.2 Linkages Between Extension and Research Efforts
Effective technology transfer requires firm linkages between research and extension. Technology is developed through research, and extensionists must have access to researchers to know and understand the latest technology to ensure its successful transmittal to farmers.
Many countries, however, do not have resources to engage in research. In those countries which do, institutional and professional linkages may not exist to provide effective communication between researchers and extensionists. Often inter-institutional rivalry, competition for funding, and communication difficulties impede their development.
Research personnel often view themselves as being above extensionists, as they have more formal education and postgraduate degrees. Usually they are willing to provide information to extension personnel, but rarely willing to receive information back from extension personnel and adjust the problems they study accordingly. This causes a breakdown in communication and coordination (Axinn, 1988).
The classic picture of extension is one where the researcher communicates his research information to the extensionist for transmittal to producers. One factor, however, is often overlooked. The researcher invariably has a professional stake in the quality of the research, and the extension worker has a personal one. Consequently an individual farmer, who has built up a personal relationship with the agent, may try a new practice based simply on faith in that particular agent. If the research was of poor quality, or erroneous, then the farmer pays the price, and the extension agent receives the blame. The researcher is removed from these personal ties. Many researchers, in fact, do not have sufficient regard for the implications of their research, or hasty publication and pronouncement of results. Consequently it is important for extension workers to know researchers and trust their abilities, and for researchers to understand that farmers need practical solutions and
research in their problems.
The survey indicated that there were no institutional vehicles in most countries for linking research and extension activities (see Table 11). The Philippines and Panama were exceptions. In the Philippines there is apparently a great deal of effort expended to coordinate research and extension efforts. Conventions, conferences, meetings with researchers and extension agents, and task forces of researchers and extension agents seem to be institutionalized and developed. The National Aquaculture Directorate in Panama performs both extension and research functions so that there is an organic link between them.
Other respondents indicated few linkages between research and extension activities. In the Cameroons, the respondent indicated that there was no need for research because the technology being extended was already well developed. In Zaïre there was recognition of the important role of research but, as there was little or no research in aquaculture, there were no results to pass on to the extension agents. The situation in Jordan was similar. In Colombia the activities were almost totally in research, with little or no extension work. In Ecuador there was research but little extension in the Ministry of Fisheries, whereas agriculture extension in the Ministry of Agriculture was well developed.
In conclusion, there is a definite lack of good interchange between researchers and extension agents. In many cases this is exacerbated because the responsibilities for these two functions are vested in different ministries or ministerial departments, and rarely is any effort made to provide formal connection between them. In other cases aquaculture programmes only have either a research or an extension function, and the other simply does not exist, or is so modest to be virtually nonexistent.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEVELOPING AND STRENGTHENING AQUACULTURE EXTENSION PROGRAMMES
In assembling information for this review of aquaculture extension methodologies, it was quickly apparent that no one "cook book" methodology would emerge which could be transferred to all countries successfully. Extension, for the most part, is about people dealing with people, and obviously people are different. Therefore it is not the purpose here to recommend or suggest one method which can be applied to all situations.
The successful aquaculture extension programmes which served as case studies were all characterized by a willingness on the part of project leaders to innovate, explore, and adapt technologies and methods to local culture, environmental conditions, and realities in carrying out their extension activities. As the world itself is a continuously changing environment, extension efforts must be flexible and capable of adapting to changing technologies and conditions.
In spite of the number of variables involved in determining the success of a particular extension effort, several important common denominators have emerged in the course of preparing this document. These common threads or principles, which have been followed in most successful aquaculture extension programmes, are summarized here to serve as recommendations for future aquaculture extension efforts.
1. Technology must be technically sound and adapted to local conditions
Technical constraints in production systems must be identified for extension efforts to be successful. For example, tilapia production will fail if ponds are not completely drained periodically to prevent over-reproduction and stunting. Additional ponds for stocking fingerlings obtained from harvests must be available to avoid dependence on government institutions. Carp culture will not work in isolated single ponds where spawning is difficult and transportation for fingerlings is not available. At the same time, the presence of technical constraints does not imply that exhaustive in-country research efforts are required before anything is done.
2. Extension workers must be well trained and personally dedicated
The key element in extension is the personal motivation of individual extension agents. Results are difficult to measure, and there is often no reward for exceptional effort other than personal gratification. The real secret to success has been the devotion and dedication of well-trained aquaculturists who fully understand basic principles of aquaculture, and are personally committed to its development.
3. The major emphasis of aquaculture development programmes should be on extension
The major focus of many aquaculture projects has been to develop seed production, demonstration, and research infrastructure. Extension activities are often added as an afterthought. Yet in most successful aquaculture projects extension efforts were given primary importance. The greater part of effort and funding was given to training and monitoring extension agents. Research followed extension in priority.
4. Feedback mechanisms must be established
Successful projects have built-in feedback mechanisms. The technologies extended must be appropriate for the farming systems used by farmers. However, farming systems research is time-consuming. Well-developed channels of communication between farmers and extension agents provide much the same information as formal farming systems research in terms of selecting technologies which "fit" into local farming practices.
5. Selection of extension workers should be tailored to the target group
According to the survey carried out for this review most extension services target subsistence producers. The agencies or departments which provide these services require agents to have graduate degrees. Fish farming is not so difficult or intellectually challenging to make this level of education necessary. Sound practical training and intimate knowledge of the lives of subsistence farmers are more essential qualifications for agents to provide successful extension services.
It appears that the most successful approach to work with subsistence farmers in rural areas is through the use of "promotores", "link workers", or "moniteurs" from that local area. For medium-scale producers it is through agents who are graduates. Large-scale commercial producers prefer to work directly with private consultants, university researchers, and government officials.
6. The programme must have support from both the government and from producers
The structure of individual extension services may not be as important as the level of commitment from the government. Resources for the services, such as budget appropriations, assignment of vehicles, and access to information, must be ensured over the long-term for any extension programme to function effectively. Acceptance of extension services and support for the programme by the producers are essential for technology transfer to occur.
7. The programme must be stable
Technology transfer is a long-term process which relies on developing trust and confidence between farmers and extension agents. Programme stability ensures familiarity with agents. Over time, relationships develop through trust in the agents to trust in the institution.
8. A good reputation can be valuable to the programme or agency
Successful technology transfer may well be related to the reputation of the agency or organization promoting a given technology. The decision to adopt a new technology is often based on the trust a farmer has in the extension agent and in the institution.
9. Links between research and extension need to be strengthened
Once a critical level of production has been established, more research activities can be justified. However, in many countries, research and extension activities are separated, and there are few means of communication. These two functions must be linked organically to contribute effectively to the development of aquaculture industries. Without feedback from farmers through extension agents, research activities invariably branch into insignificant or esoteric areas. Without access to research results, extension agents lag behind technological innovations.
10. The primary goal of extension is education
Most successful aquaculture projects have not invariably supplied production inputs but have focused on providing technical assistance, information, and training. Supplying production inputs, other than initial seed stocks, can result in a dependency on government and impede potential development of local businesses producing or manufacturing equipment, or providing other services.
In conclusion, each country has different goals, philosophies, and institutional organizational structures which relate to aquacultural extension. It was evident, in preparing this document, that structures of extension services are of secondary importance to the dedication and skills of extension agents. In the final analysis, it is attitudes towards extension and extension agents which lead to success or failure of aquaculture development. Too often, when there is an apparent lack of effectiveness on the part of an extension agency, the response is reorganization of the department and reshuffling staff positions or titles. These activities do not address the fundamental problems. Careful attention to selection and training of appropriate extension personnel is essential. Only when the critical role of the extension agent is understood and incorporated into policy can there be real progress towards developing aquaculture industries.

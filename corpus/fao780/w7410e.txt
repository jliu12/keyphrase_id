A. National Forest Programmes
The objective of NFP is to provide the necessary strategic orientation for the implementation of the programmes and activities in the forestry sector in which all the concerned actors participate¹. It's main function is at national or sub-national level.
^1 For more details, we recommend that you read the document published by the Forestry Department of FAO: Formulation, Implementation and Revision of National Forestry Programmes: Basic Principles and Operational Choices, Rome 1996
At operational level, the NFP process can be divided into four phases:
· Organisation Process
This concerns the identification of the actors in the forestry sector or influencing the sector, or those being influenced by the sector; organisation of national coordination mechanisms and elaboration of a communication strategy.
· Strategic Planning
This includes an initial analysis of the present situation, including, if necessary, detailed sector-based studies, followed by elaboration and analysis of the scenarios resulting from a combination of options relating to the domains studied. The final phase is decisive; the choice of certain scenarios can result in political, institutional or operational options which can develop in different ways: Declaration of Forestry Policies, Forestry Law, Forestry Strategy or Plan of Action etc.
· Implementation
This is related to the detailed formulation of investment programmes and projects, obtaining funds and the coordination and follow-up of activities.
· Revision and Up-date
This concerns evaluation of the result of activities and, if necessary, periodic review of their basic strategy.
It should be noted that this is a continuous process during which the different phases can interact.
B. Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management
During the 1990's, the attention drawn to the forests and their change enhanced the concept of durability and the need for criteria and indicators to describe and measure forest management. Different international conferences have established lists of indicators to be applied essentially on a national level. The Processes of Helsinki and Montreal for boreal or temperate countries, the Proposition of Tarapoto and the Tegucigalpa Meeting for Latin American countries and the UNEP/FAO initiative (Nairobi Meeting) and the Cairo Meeting for the dry African Zone, Near and Middle East, are the realisation of these efforts.
As the task of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Forestry (IFF)^2 was to reach, in an open and participatory manner, a consensus and formulation of propositions coordinated for the sustainable management of forests, the role or Criteria and Indictors was emphasised and it was specified that their development must be "a gradual process based on national sustainable forest management policies".
^2Implemented in 1995.
What should be understood by Criteria and Indicator?
The document "Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management"^3 (1997) puts forward the following definitions:
^3Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management in Finland, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 1997.
Criteria describe the different aspects of sustainability at a conceptual level. A criterion is a characteristic feature or a set of conditions, based on which it is possible to evaluate the various aspects of forestry. A criterion contains a built-in goal to strive for. The evaluation of a criterion is based on evaluation of indicators.
Indicators show or reflect the state of art as well as time related changes. They indicates how well each criterion meets the goals set. Typically an indicator shows a quantitative change. As all aspects of forestry cannot be measured with quantitative indicators, some descriptive indicators have been formulated to reflect the change regarding the legal, institutional and economic policy framework as well as the informational means to implement the policy.
When the use of an Indicator is decided on, it is up to the scientific community to validate it and establish it's assessment conditions. The interest of policy makers is, thus, limited to available results to establish a strategy of activities. Therefore, the Criteria and Indicators must have a clear and even simple definition.
C. Complementary Procedures
It appears that the Criteria and Indicators can play a part in the framework of NFP. Indeed, the objective of NFP is to formulate and support the establishment of a political framework for the sustainable conservation, management and development of forests, and the progress accomplished needs to be followed up and measured. Whereas, the Indicators are defined as showing or reflecting the state and change of sustainable development. The Indicators could be used as measuring instruments for the NFP. In fact the Criteria and Indicators would then become indicating signals concerning the degree of formulation, as well as the progress accomplished by NFP.
Moreover, forest resources assessment activities are to be taken into account as they reflect the state and change of forest resources. It is the capacity to provide such information which will allow to: (i) reply to certain Indicators of sustainable forest management with a numerical value; and (ii) note if an intention to follow the situation of the forestry domain exists in order to better control the development of a forestry policy.
Thus, it is important to study in which way NFP and the Criteria and Indicators interact in order to reinforce the process of sustainable forest management and to take note of the complementary role of forest resources assessment.

II. A PRELIMINARY STUDY
In order to understand how the Criteria and Indicators for sustainable management can be integrated in NFP, the cases of six countries were chosen. These were: Cameroon, Cape Verde, Ecuador, Indonesia, Senegal and Vietnam. These choices are based on achievements accomplished by the NFPs of those countries, but also on the wish to cover different geographic situations (tropical countries, humid and dry); sizes (regional powers or simple islands); and the prevailing forestry contexts.
However, first of all the list of Criteria and Indicators should be specified.
In the framework of the Processes and Initiatives of Helsinki, Montreal, UNEP/FAO and Tarapoto, several sets of Criteria and Indicators were established. It then appeared necessary to harmonise the lists and a session of the "Inter-Governmental Seminar on Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management (August 19-22, 1996, Helsinki, Finland)" was consecrated to this. In the summary report,^4 the working group writes: "The group recognised that existing sets of national level criteria and indicators are conceptual similar" but also underlines that "As many countries have not yet been involved in criteria and indicators processes, and as those countries which are currently involved are just starting implementation of criteria and indicators, it was recognised that it may be premature to try to achieve convergence".
4Summary Report of the Inter-Governmental Seminar on Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management, 22 August 1996.
However, in the framework of the "Expert Consultation on Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000, Kotka III (June 10-14, 1996, Kotka, Finland)", Mengin-Lecreulx (in the note "Indicators of sustainable forest management at national level and possibilities to assess them in national, regional and global forest inventories") established a list of convergence based on the sets of Criteria and Indicators of Helsinki, Montreal, UNEP/FAO and Tarapoto. Thus, 80 Indicators were defined and sub-divided into six categories:
1) State and change process of forest resources
2) Biological diversity
3) Health and vitality
4) Production of wood and other forest products
5) Soil and water protection
6) Socio-economic functions
In his study, Mengin-Lecreulx limited the review of convergence and comparability list to the first five categories and only partially approached the Socio-economic functions category. In order to take into account all the various Criteria and Indicators developed in the sets of Helsinki, Montreal, UNEP/FAO and Tarapoto, we have completed the Socio-economic functions category (20 more Indicators) and integrated the Legal and institutional frameworks category (9 Indicators).
Therefore the list of Criteria and Indicators (see Annex 1: List of Indicators), on which the rest of our study is based is the following:
Number of indicators
State and change process of forest resources,
Biological diversity,
Health and vitality,
Production of wood and other forest products,
Soil and water protection,
Socio-economic functions,
Legal and institutional frameworks,
Total
On the basis of the above, a first step was to determine whether the notion Criteria and Indicators was not already implicitly present in the NFP procedures and at which step of the process they were applied. An assessment will attempt to determine the importance of the Indicators and to understand their performance in each country. Depending on the results obtained, the implementation of the Criteria and Indicators in NFP could be specified.

III. A COMPARATIVE APPROACH
A. Use of the Indicators
B. Limitation of Indicators
C. Un-used Indicators
As underlined above, the activities of a NFP are in line with sustainable development of the forestry sector. The analytical studies and prospectives undertaken of the forestry situation of a country back up a number of national references of biological, economic, social and institutional order. It is therefore interesting to see if they correspond to Indicators of sustainable forest management.
In the NFP process, each sector-based study is organised into three steps: (a) a formulation of the existing situation; (b) a proposition of activities to be carried out; and (c) an estimation of the future beneficiaries. On this basis, the Indicators can be arranged into the following categories:
a) Formulation:
- Situation element (sector review)
- Alert element (identification of priority constraints)
b) Realisation
c) Evaluation of progress achieved:
- Follow-up element
- Evaluation element
The analysis of available NFP studies of the six chosen countries enabled to list the Indicators mentioned in the sector-based studies of NFP and enumerate them (see Annex 2: The Indicators Recognised in the Sector-based NFP Studies). The Table below indicates in which category the Indicators belonged and how they are divided up between Formulation, Realisation and Evaluation.

* Percentage of Indicators found in the NFPs of the six countries studied compared to the total number of Indicators initially identified (see Annex 1).
In this way, 48 Indicators (of a total of 109) were found in the processes of the NFPs studied. The categories of Criteria and Indicators concerning (i) State and change process of forest resources: ii) Socio-economic functions: and iii) Legal and institutional frameworks, seem to have a very significative role in the process (formulation and follow-up/evaluation phase for the first two categories and realisation phase for the last).
A. Use of the Indicators
However, the impact of the Indicators appears to differ (see Annex 3: Indicators Recognised in the NFP of the Countries Studied).
1 The unavoidable Indicators
In every study and for all countries, a certain number of Indicators appear constantly. Thus, 5 Indicators belonging to State and change process of forest resources are particularly mentioned (-Forest area, -Other wooded land area, -Area of forest and vegetation types, -Forest plantations area per species category and -Forest area converted to other uses). These, therefore reveal that knowledge of forest resources and their utilisation is essential and stress the important role of forest resources assessment.
As for Socio-economic functions, the production (-Volume of wood production, -Production of non-wood forest products, -Value of wood products, -Value of non-wood forest products and -Value from biomass energy), and the recreation aspects (-Area managed with primary objective: leisure and tourism) are mentioned parallel to the economic performances (-Share of forest sector in GNP et -Forest sector trade balance).
Finally, the importance of a legal and institutional framework (-National forest policy, legislation and regulations and -Institutional instrument and tools) is underlined, together with economic (-Economic framework and financial instruments) and scientific aspects (-Valorisation of local expertise, knowledge and local technologies and -Transfer and adaptation of appropriate technologies).
As for the evaluation of the results expected from sustainable development, the Indicator - % of managed forest according to a management plan or management guidelines, should measure the results accomplished.
2 Particular Indicators
Moreover, in the six cases studied, other indicators were found, although their role seems to concern national problems such as fuelwood or demographic pressure.
Thus, the provision of fuelwood is regarded important in every case and requires the Indicator:-Average consumption of fuelwood per caput and per year. With the exception of Cape Verde where there are no more forests, preservation of natural forests imposes that other States take into account the Indicator: - Area of strictly protected forest reserves, and forests that are protected by a special management regime and change process. In the same way, data are expected on: -Biomass according to forest types, -Total standing volume and - Average standing volume, possibly by vegetation zones or site classes.
As for Indonesia and Vietnam, where demographic pressure is very high, the occupation of forest land justifies the use of -Forest area by ownership type and the particular attention to -Number of endangered forests and change process.
B. Limitation of Indicators
Even if the Indicators of the Legal and institutional frameworks category are fully used in the processes of NFP studied, it appears that they are insufficient to express the complexity of legal and institutional aspects. Certainly, the importance of these aspects is re-affirmed in the framework of the Ecuadorian Consultation on the Process of Tarapoto.^5 However, the NFP of Ecuador enables a wider vision for the understanding of the state of the forestry sector and to build up propositions relating to the precise needs of: (i) legislation; (ii) the institutional framework; (iii) integration and institutional coordination; (iv) investment promotion; and (v) the valorisation of human resources
^5Study particular to Ecuador: Proceso de Tarapoto sobre criterios e indicadores de sostenibilidad de bosque amazonico, republica del Ecuador - enero 1997.
In fact, the use of Indicators belonging to the Legal and institutional frameworks category reduces the comprehension of the particular processes of each country. For Ecuador, the elaboration of a forestry policy is a new procedure, whereas in Indonesia, a forestry code exists and steps towards is planning have already been implemented. In the Vietnamese example, the role of the war (which lasted 30 years) in the stale-mate situation of the forestry sector cannot be quoted, nor that of the substantial international assistance in favour of Vietnameses forests.
Furthermore, the reflection conducted in Vietnam refers to other Indicators: (-Area of strictly protected forest reserves and forest that are protected by a special management regime and change process, -Number of endangered species/number of forest species, and change process, -Forest land area with compacted soil and/or -whose physical properties have been altered or -Management of landscape). However, these seem too isolated to describe the reality of the country. Indeed, demographic pressure and substantial human settlements in mountainous forestry zones are key factors to deforestation and define measures to be taken for sustainable forest management.
In Cameroon, the objectives of "forest product marketing" have constraints, such as infrastructure, the proportion of commercial species or demographic pressure which remain invisible through the Criteria and Indicators, while in Senegal the mission of "Responsabilisation of rural populations" poses the problem of local mentalities that cannot be easily estimated in the framework of the Criteria and Indicators.
In the case of Cape Verde, the Criteria and Indicators cannot easily be adjusted to a country with no natural forests. Sustainable development of forest plantations is subject to a lasting valorisation of the whole of the agricultural sector. To obtain a coherent understanding of the agro-silvo-pastoralism sector, the predominance of socio-cultural and socio-economic constraints must therefore be detailed and analysed with subtly to grasp the complexity of the country.
Comparatively to the other examples, it appears that the Criteria and Indicators available for Indonesia allow to describe, analyse and evaluate better the situation of the country. In Indonesia, where there is high forest potential and a strong forestry sector, the use of Criteria and Indicators provides the necessary references for sustainable management and conservation of an important wood-exporting country.
C. Un-used Indicators
More than half the Indicators of our initial list (61 out of a total of 109) do not appear in the NFP processes of the six countries. Several reasons explain this situation.
Among these 61 Indicators, 33 were only defined in the framework of the Helsinki and Montreal Processes. As the relate to temperate zone specifications, it seems logical that these indicators do not appear in our case study which only covers tropical countries.
As for the 28 Indicators left over, they were presented at the UNEP/FAO and/or Tarapoto initiatives and their absence can be explained in two ways:
· The information mentioned is important, but was unavailable. There is no reference in the six cases to be studied.
Examples:
- Areas affected by insect attacks or diseases or
- Annual clearing of forest ecosystems which contain endemic species
· The Information mentioned can be considered as beyond the immediate demands of the country.
Examples:
- Number of forest species which have a reduced distribution area compared to their area of origin or
- Change in the balance of nutritional elements and soil acidity (CEC and pH) in the course of the last 10 years

IV. A PROCEDURE TO BE CONDUCTED
A. What to Retain of the Integration of Criteria and Indicators in the NFP process?
B. Possible Implementation
The above remarks underline that the Criteria and Indicators cannot easily measure the complexity of interactions between the forestry and agricultural environments, or the role man should play. Moreover, even if it is possible to integrate the Indicators into a number of themes tackled by the NFP of the six countries (see Annex 4: Indicators Defined Following the NFP Themes), it appears that these are an efficient way to apprehend the evolution and progress of rich tropical forest management (ex. Indonesia).
A. What to Retain of the Integration of Criteria and Indicators in the NFP process?
It should be reminded that the vocation of the Criteria and Indicators is not to construct a sustainable forestry development policy, but to measure it. These are but tools.
Consequently, the Criteria and Indicators must be considered when the evaluation and development of certain forest sector activities are established and implemented. At that point they will become reference and control points forcing the production of data which will provide a coherent comprehension of accomplished progress and facilitate the step towards sustainable forest management.
On the basis of Annex 4, it appears that the Criteria and Indicators are particularly pertinent concerning:
· Forest management
· Eco-system conservation
· Forest genetic and seeds
and that they cover the essential aspects of:
· Fuelwood sector
and that they give a partial view of:
· Forest land-use
Moreover, whatever the sector-based study is, the indicators relative to Legal and institutional frameworks must be taken into account.
B. Possible Implementation
For the integration of Criteria and Indicators in NFP to be effective, it appears important that it should be underlined from the start of the organisation of the process. The interest groups of the forestry sector and other related sectors must be informed of the concert of Criteria and Indicators. It should, thus, indicate that:
· The Criteria and Indicators are not another constraint;
· Their vocation is not to moralise the countries regarding their forest management;
· They are only instruments referring to a national situation;
· They participate in strategic planning;
· They can be implemented progressively.
While concentrating on strategic planning, it seems essential that parallel to the identification of the main problems, that the list of Criteria and Indicators is established according to the different experts in charge of the detailed sector-based analyses. Each criterion and Indicator must have a unique definition corresponding to or closely related to the one accepted internationally.
It must then be specified at which level of the Plan of Action the indicators will be used:
· To measure the present situation and it's degree of emergency;
· To specify the realisations to be accomplished in the framework of the scenarios used by the NFP;
· To follow-up it's implementation;
· To evaluate the gains obtained in sustainable forest development.
Concerning the particular category of descriptive Indicators Legal and institutional frameworks, their use must be immediate and correspond to a presentation of reforms which are carried out.
Referring to our six study cases, we propose, as an example to use the Indicators on the basis of general objectives such as:
· Forest management;
· Eco-system conservation;
· Forest land use;
Furthermore, the sets of Indicators proposed (see Annex 5: Proposition for the Use of Criteria and Indicators) can be organised and combined to analyse, amidst the general objectives, more particular aspects such as:
General Objectives:
Particular Aspects:
· Forest management
- Forest Inventory
· Eco-system conservation:
- Conservation of the environment, of soils and water,
- Watersheds
- Conservation systems, natural parks and protected areas;
- Development of wildlife and protected areas;
· Forest land use:
- Forest resources and village land management
- Forestry and rural development
- Agro-forestry
Finally, taking into account the 48 Indicators that appeared in the NFPs studied, and the concern generally expressed by tropical countries, 55 Indicators seem to have priority for the studies carried out in the framework of NFP (See Annex 6: Possible Indicators for the Sector-based Studies).

Depending on the forestry programmes that each country wishes to conduct, the Criteria and Indicators used can be different from one country to another. However, it is essential that the selection used is explained and adjusted to the sustainable development of each nation.

V. THE ROLE OF FOREST RESOURCES ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS
Mengin-Lecreulx applied his study to define and then assess the Indicators which could be taken into account for the new global forest resources assessment (Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management at National Level and Possibilities to Assess them in National, Regional and Global Forest Inventories, Kotka, Finland, 10-14 June 1996). After the Expert Consultation on Global Forest Resources Assessment (GFRA) 2000 (Kotka III, Finland, 10-14 June 1996), experts recommended 15 Indicators and estimated that 8 supplementary Indicators could be partially evaluated.
Among these national and global level Indicators, it seems that 16 were taken into consideration in the framework of the six NFPs studied in this note (see Annex 7: The Indicators of FRA 2000 and their Role in the NFP). The others, which were of purely global concept (total carbon storage) or very theoretical notions (Fragmentation of forests or Change in defoliation during the last 5 years) are far beyond the immediate concerns stemming from sustainable forest management.
Moreover, as defined in the framework of FRA, the national systems of forest assessment should participate not only in the measurement of the Indicators, but also offer information which could facilitate the actions of NFP and their review/actualisation.
During the up-date of data on global forest resources for SOFO 1997, a questionnaire was sent out by the Forest Resources Division. The level of reply (around 25%) thus underlines a first necessity for improving information control and its distribution, which can be taken into account in the framework of NFP.

Of the countries having replied, most of them are engaged in NFP processes, although few are capable of transmitting up-to-date data based on forest inventories. This situation reflects the difficulty of underlining the importance of forest resources assessment in the establishment of a forestry policy. Moreover, the under-estimation of the role of inventories is obvious, as out of the 37 countries having replied, only 10 countries (mainly Asian) have conducted an inventory cycle up to now. Thus the revision mechanisms functioning in the framework of NFP could help to improve this situation.
Finally, it is important to note that the Criteria and Indicators of sustainable forest management and forest resources assessment data form essential tools if NFP are to be used as efficient vectors of sustainable forestry development. A number of NFP elaborated and implemented up until today are not as efficient as they should be, as the knowledge and strategic orientation tools are insufficient and unreliable.

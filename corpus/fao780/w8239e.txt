<title>FAO Fisheries Circular No. 935 FIRM/C935. Trial Fishing for Lantern Fishes (Myctophids) in the gulf of oman (1989-1990)</title>
<section>1</section>
1. INTRODUCTION
A series of studies, were begun in 1975 on mesopelagic resources, consisting of several studies in the Arabian Sea, Pakistani offshore waters, the Gulf of Aden and the Gulf of Oman. But up to 1989 there had not been any conclusive and independent studies in the Iranian waters of the Gulf of Oman.
In August 1989, a contract was signed between the Iranian Fisheries Company and Fisheries Committee of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea with the aim of stock assessment of myctophids resources and trial fishing. For this purpose, the R.V. Jeng Bang San was used in Iranian waters of the Gulf of Oman.
During 1989-1990, 8 cruises were carried out using this vessel in the region, not only for trial fishing but also for estimating the biomass of lantern fish (myctophids) resources. During these cruises biological and acoustic data were obtained. The present report describes results from the following cruises:
Cruise No. Date
1 13 Sept. - 8 Oct. 1989
2 15 Oct. - 16 Nov.1989
3 30 Nov. - 27 Dec. 1989
4 11 Jan. - 12 Feb. 1990
During these cruises, other information was collected consisting of:
* Ratio of fish meal/fish (raw material)
* Comparing effects of different mesh sizes of nets and carrying out trial fishing
* Determining the specifications of a suitable vessel for fishing myctophids.

2.2 Study method
In order to determine the distribution of Myctophids and undertake stock assessments of these resources, the R.V. Jeng Bang San surveyed the Gulf of Oman (Iranian side) during eight cruises. The area covered was from Ras'lkish in the west to Gwatar in the East. During some cruises the entire area was covered but in four of them, only a partial coverage was possible. Survey tracks differed between different cruises.
By using the echosounder the traces of the fish were recorded in the form of echograms. These echograms showed features such as: length and width of school, position, integration lines and condition of the distributions. Associated information (date, time, survey route, position, school form, school length and width) was recorded on special sheets. After
detecting the lantern fish schools, trial fishing was randomly carried out to collect biological data. Positions of survey routes and trial fishing stations are shown in Figures 1 to 8.

3. DISTRIBUTION OF LANTERN FISHES
The results from 4 cruises showed that lantern fishes occurred in the whole area of the Gulf of Oman from Ras'lkuh in the west to the Iranian-Pakistani maritime border in the east, but the main density was recorded in Jagin and Jask area.
During the day, they were found at 200-400m depth but after sunset, they migrated towards the surface layers and remained at depths of 10-70m. At sunrise, they started moving down. This upward and downward migration took about 30 minutes. It seems that the migration behaviour depended on vertical movement of the plankton. Because the main food of lanternfishes are different zooplankters, they migrate towards surface with the aim of eating the zooplankters.
During daytime, they live in two different layers: D1, at 150-225m and D2, at 250-400m, they are also found in 2 layers at night namely: N1 at 50-90m and N2 at 185-245m depths (note: the echograms were not helpful in illustrating this). The horizontal distribution maps have been shown in Figures 13 to 16.
The temperature range of the myctophids's habitat is wide in the 300-400m depth band during the day-time. The temperature [at greater depths] is about 14-16° C, and it is about 22-28° C in the 20-50m depth band during night time. Thus the difference between day and night time temperatures in myctophid's habitat is 8-12° C but this appears to be no problem as they adjust themselves to this temperature range which shows the high tolerency of this small fish.
The ambient and sea surface temperature were registered during four cruises. Until November, the atmospheric temperature was 31-33^oC by day and 29-30^oC by night. The temperature difference between night and day had been very little, but because of Northeast and Northwest winds a considerable difference was observed:
Day time Night time
End of November 30-31^oC 27-29^oC
December 28-30^oC 24-25^oC
January 24-28^oC 20-22^oC
February The temperature was very low (about 20^oC)
The sea surface temperature's data showed a difference between western and eastern sites of surveyed area. The isotherm lines have been drawn for each cruise separately (Figures9to12).

4. LENGTH MEASUREMENTS
These measurements were taken from samples collected from all trial fishings for B.pterotum. Length frequency histograms (Figures 17 to 40) show that juvenile lanternfishes of 13-15mm length to adult species, 40-45mm, were found among the catch. No obvious spawning season were identified and it is concluded that myctophids spawn several times during a year.
By comparing the histograms of 4 cruises, it was found that in September and October, mostly small fishes were observed and adult fishes were rarely seen. At this time, the lanternfishes with 12-30mm in length with a mean length of 18.6mm and were observed from Ras'lkuh to soutwest of Jagin. There were an increase in length measurements within the next months. At the end of October and in November, the mean length was about 30-36mm. From inshore to offshore regions, the length decreased by up to 28mm.
Different regions contained different size classes of lanternfish but as a rule, adults and big fishes were found in the D1 - layer, and after mixing two layers of D1 and D2 layers at night the mean length significantly decreased and both small and big fishes were found among the catch. In December, the bigger lanternfishes with a mean length of 34-35mm were observed. The percentage of spawners at this time was about 50% and this ratio increased until January.
The results of length measurements in different areas from January to February were:
Area Min - Max (mm) Mean (mm)
Jask 18 - 40 29 - 32
Grishkin 18 - 42 33.5 - 35
Jagin - Ras'lkuh 25 - 44 31.3 - 33.6
Offshore waters of Ras'lkuh 30 - 47 37.4
(15mm far from above region)
All of the catch were collected using a midwater trawler with codend of 2a = 9mm.
Sixty percent of these fishes had been spawners.

5. STOCK ASSESSMENT OF LANTERN FISH RESOURCES
The method of stock assessment of mesopelagic resources (myctophids) was relied on both echo integration data and trial fishing. This method is shown by Equation:
Biomass
B = ò .w = ò o / j .w (1)
ò [o] = Q[o]/F.v.t.
Q = Q[o]/Q.100
Q = Q[o] + q
Density
ò = Q/F.v.t (2)
Where
B = biomass (kg)
ò = distribution density (kg/m³)
ò [o ]= catch density (kg/m³)
W = distribution volume (m³)
F= opening mouth area (m²)
V = tow velocity (m/s)
T = towing time (s)
Q[o ]= amount of catch (kg)
Q = amount of fish in towing region (kg)
q = amount of fish escaped from net (kg)
j = catch coefficient (%)
The amount of fish that escaped through the net meshes in different parts of nets was estimated by installing small meshed nets to various parts of the main net. The amount of escaped fishes were calculated using formula 3:
q = q[1] F[1 + ]q[2] F[2 +....]q[n]F[n ](3)
q[1], q[2], q[n ]: amount of fish entered in each sac (kg)
F[1], F[2], F[n] : the area of the opening of the small mesh sac (m²)
w8239e20.jpg (22966 byte) Also, there were seven experimental hauls to find out and estimate the amount of fish escaped from main net (Table 1).
The results showed that, for each 10t catch, about 2.5t fish escaped. In addition, some other fishes escaped from the codend and as other fishes (e.g., Nesepinnula sp.) damaged the net and therefore some Myctophids would have escaped from the net as a consequence.

The biomass estimates were made for the four different cruises (see Table 2). As the table shows, the biomass estimates ranged from 1 118 000 to 1 330 000t within a 10 400 nm^2 area (limited by the 50nm bound offshore from the Iranian coastline). If the total area of the Gulf of Oman (Iranian side) is taken as 20 000nm^2 and if it is assumed that the fish density was 9/m^3, the total biomass estimate is then 2 100 000 - 2 300 000t.

6. TRIAL FISHING
During the study period on the lantern fish stocks, 310 hauls were carried out. The trial fishing stations were randomly selected and if there were good traces of fish with high density on echosounder, a fishing tow was undertaken.. The specifications of the midwater trawl one given in Section 2.1.3 early mentioned. The catch from each haul was estimated and information, eg, time of towing, distance of towing, depth, date, length of wire, velocity, direction, ambient temperature, sea surface temperature, position, etc. were recorded on special sheets.
The distribution of surface temperature (isotherms) are illustrated in Figures 42 to 45.The amount of catch from each trial tow for cruises 1 to 4 are shown in the tables 3-6.
Since an appropriate small mesh size net for myctophids was not used during the first three days of the first trial fishing, the results show a trend following the installation of a NY210D/12-20mm net as a net lining of the cod-end as all target fishes passed through the net meshes so that the catch volume was approximately nothing. Thus, during the second stage, a nylon NY210D/6-9mm net was obtained from the Iranians and was installed within the cod-end (along with the small-sized one) and then it was installed on the trawl pieces numbered 5 to 6 on the body of the net. Following the installation of this internal net along with the NY210D/12- 20mm, the trial fishing was carried out from 23 to 30 September for 20 tows.

The mean catch for haul was 1.74t, with the maximum catch of 3t and the mean catch per unit of time (hour) was 0.47 t/h and the maximum was 0.82 t/h. These figures indicate negligible amounts of catch.
During the third cruise of the fishing using a NY210D/6-9mm small mesh size net, the internal net was extended up to the sixth piece on the body of the net (for 6m) and even further. Fishing operations continued from 1 to 12 October for 8 tows during which the mean catch per haul was 3.56t with a maximum of 8.5t. In terms of catch per hour, the mean was 0.94t with a maximum of 1.71t. Compared with the fishing gears applied during the second cruise, the catch amount was doubled.
During the fourthcruise, the internal net, along with a nylon small mesh size net, were extended up to the fifth piece on the body of the net. With such an arrangement, the length of the body of the trawl was extended by 12m, the side cod-end (supplementary) by 8m and the cod-end itself for 15m; which together totaled 35m. Its cross-sectional area was 24.54m^2.
These developments helped the users prepare, at the extreme upper end of the trawl, an internal net made of NY210D/12-20mm nylon for the fourth piece on the body of the net after which the trial fishing was launched. During this phase seven tows were undertaken, from 4 to 6 October. The average catch from each operation (per haul) was 9t and the maximum was 12t. The mean catch was 1.92t/h, with a maximum of 2.7t/h. These figures indicate a four times increase in the amount of catch compared to the gears used in the second cruise; the catch was doubled compared to the third cruise of operations.
Because about 80 of the trial tows were done using trawls whose catching capacity was low, the catch volume recorded during the trial fishing of the first expedition was also low. Furthermore, since most of the time was spent surveying, the frequency of hauling operations was limited and also the concentration of the myctophids in most of the South Western areas of Jask was almost negligible. The trial fishing pertinent to the second expedition was combined with an exploratory operation over the entire region, from Ras'l Kuh to Meidani.
In spite of the fishing being the main objective during the first six days of the second expedition (15-20 October), the operation was only carried out on the grounds facing Meidani. But due to the very small size of the target fishes in the area, the catch volume, recorded, 0.5-3t in each operation and 0.11 to 0.68t in terms of per haul, was very low. From 20 October, a dense stock of the fishes in the areas facing Ghirishkin was encountered and catches of 1.2t in each tow were obtained.
From 26 October till 19 November, trial fishing was done in the area between Jask and Jageen where the stocks were relatively dense. About 60trial tows were launched in the region and the mean of the catch in each operation (per haul) was 6.5t with a maximum of 12t. In terms of catch per hour, the mean was 1.71t; the maximum level was 5.3t. The mean of daily catch recorded 21.2t with an extreme of 29.0t.

The major reason justifying the lack of improvement in the catch rate during the trial fishing of the second cruise was that, due to the availability of only the short trawl warps, it was difficult to change the depth of towing and the depth of the target fish was deeper than 270m. Even if making such an adjustment were feasible, it would have been impossible to reduce the towing speed to a rate of 2knots.
Out of the 74 tows undertaken during the third expedition, 69 were in the region facing Jageen and Jask. Because of the development of a very dense fish concentrations which used to migrate close to the coast from the beginning of December, the catch volume appeared to be satisfactory.
Regardless of two unusual fishing operations out of the 74 tows, of the other 72 tows, the average catch was 7.75t with a maximum of 15t.

The status and amount of catch during the trial fishing of the third cruise was satisfactory, but because of some technical defects and problems in fish meal machinery, only 2-3 fishing operations (hauls) were carried out per day. Shortly after, the machinery was repaired and the daily production exceeded 3t. From 18 to 23 November the number of operations (hauls) increased until 4.4 times per day with a maximum of six hauls per day.
Compared with the results of the second and third expeditions in the same region, there was an increase of nearly two-fold, namely the amount of catch per hour was two times more in the third cruise compared with the second cruise.
In the fourth cruise, the status of the lantern fish resources was completely different with the previous cruises and there was no good catch in Jask and Jageen areas. Therefore, the detecting activities and trial fishings were restricted from the southern part of Ras'Ikuh to the western areas of Meidanie.
Compared to the beginning of December, myctophid fishes were not found far from the coastal areas, shallow waters. Even though the density of the resources was satisfactory, the schools of fish were not eye-catching enough and they were scattered in a way so that the outcome was a reduction in the level of catch.
Because there was a relatively dense school of the fish scattered 18miles off the southwestern part of Jask, trial fishing was undertaken during which the mean catch in each operation was 6t with the maximum of 12 mt. The mean of the catch per hour was 2.43t with a maximum level of 6t.

From 19-23 January, 20 tows were undertaken in the Jageen - Jask region in which the mean of the catch in terms of each operation was 5.5t with a maximum level 10t. The volume of catch per hour was 2t with a maximum of 4.5t. These rates did not appear to constitute a satisfactory volume.

From 24 January until 7 February, the researchers encountered a relatively high number of fish schools in the grounds facing Ghirish Keen so that in 42 tows out of 45, the average catch was 8.5t and the maximum 17t. The mean of the catch per hour and its maximum were 4.45t and 20t, respectively which were not so large.

7. FISHING GEARS AND TECHNIQUES FOR CATCHING MYCTOPHIDS
7.1 Fishing operations
Mid-water trawls seems to be a highly appropriate method for catching myctophids provided that the pertinent studies on the scattering areas, habit and ecology of the resources have been made. At the beginning of the trial fishing, design and development of a proper mid-water trawl for catching myctophids had been taken into account on the basis of catching and investigating the target fish. But, unfortunately, due to the unavailability of the required piece for the new net, the researchers were obliged to use the trawl net which was usually used for catching demersal species by the R.V. Jeng Bang San.
The design of the trawl net used in the trial fishing is shown in Figure 42. As is well illustrated, this is a type of net which is usually used for catching demersal fish, and compared to other nets in terms of the towing power of vessel, seems to be very small for use as a midwater trawl. On the other hand, because the thread used in the net had a large diameter and also its related equipment was very heavy, the net was strong and all of its parts are overweight. Further, because of the inappropriateness of the mesh size for catching small fishes such as myctophids, the cod end and also the lower piece of the body of the net should have been changed to a smaller mesh-sized net. The catch success for the species, such as myctophids mainly depends upon the largeness of the net opening and the smallness of the mesh, because the swimming ability of this species is negligible and their escape reactions towards the rim of the net are not strong. But if such a net is towed too
quickly, the flow of water through the meshs) decreases. And because of the increasing resistance the stretch of the net also decreases; slowing down will improve the water flow through the net.
Therefore, following appropriate adjustments between the small mesh size net on one hand, and the towing power of the vessel on the other, and also taking into account the habit as well as the ecology of lantern fish resources as the major variables, further stretching the opening of the trawl-net turns to be highly significant in improving the water passing through the net and subsequent catch of myctophids.
To investigate these issues, the researchers ran experiments on the capacity of the catch and on the other dynamic factors of the trawl based on a small mesh size net (Ny 2100/6-9 mt) through which the myctophid fishes could not escape. Factors pertinent to trawl design based on the small mesh size are given in Table 17.

As the table 17 indicates, when the opening area of the small mesh size net becomes four times as much, the towing speed of the net decreases by 5% and when the opening area becomes nine times greater, the latter decreases by 8%.
In spite of this trend, the towing speed is sufficient for catching myctophids while the small size net is stretched more, in proportion to its stretch, the opening area shows a decreasing trend from 5 to 10%, which is not considerable in proportion to the degree of stretching of the small mesh size net.
Accordingly, it was concluded that when the towing power of the vessel is great, even if the small mesh size net is stretched more, it will not raise any particular problem in the dynamic factors of the trawl net. Table 18 shows the catch volume in proportion to the degree ofstretchofthesmallmeshnet.

According to Table 18, the catch of myctophids through trawl mainly depends on the mesh size which prevents the fish from escaping. When the circumference of a small mesh size net becomes four times as much and its length increases 1.25 time, the catch volume is doubled and when the two former variables become 9 and 15 times as much, respectively, the catch volume increases four times as much.
The catch density of the trawl No. 1 that has in its cod-end a very small mesh size net, compared with the trawls No. 2 and 3 improved two-fold and that is an indication of some fish escaping through the large meshes.
It seems essential to consider factors such as the strength and water flow-through rate when the lay-out of a small mesh size net is prepared. Since the slope of the trawl-net in the lower end part of the trawl is high (K (slope) = 0.215), it results in the increase of the slope rate of a small mesh size net. This creates a sudden reduction in the water flow. If it is intended to improve the water flow and prevent the occurrence of such a sudden reduction in the water flow through the net, it will be necessary to increase the slope of the last piece of the net to an even lower degree than that of a slope of 0.15.
To fulfill such an objective, cutting the net should be in accordance with 1N1B and the length of the lower piece of the net (area within which the internal small mesh size net installed) should be increased and extended from the present 12m up to 17m.
When in the process of trial fishing, hairtail were caught a by-catch, and tearing of the net was frequent because the small mesh net was not sufficiently. The occurrence of such an event was frequent when operations were in the shallower areas, less than 200m. Thus, to avoid damage of the small mesh size net, one must avoid fishing in the grounds where there is the likelihood of hairtail (Trichiurus sp.) bycatch and to use NY2100/9-9 small mesh size net.
Towing speed of the trial trawl net in terms of RPM fluctuating between 1 and 1.6 is illustrated in Figure 43. As Figure 43shows, engine speed during the trial fishing varied between 130 and 155 RPM. Based on the figure, when RPM is 130, towing speed will fluctuate between 1.1 and 1.4 m/s and when RPM is 155, towing speed will be around 1.40 to 1.48m/s.

If one considers the state of the opening of the trawl net and its relationship with towing speed, it will be similar to Figure 38. As is illustrated in Figure 44, when the towing speed is 1.1m/s, the vertical opening area of the trawl net will be 19m and its horizontal extent will be around 20m. On the other hand, when the towing speed reaches around 1.5 m/s, the vertical and horizontal opening areas become 18.5 and 24m respectively.
When the length of the trawl warp was less than 100m, due to the shortness of the wire, the horizontal opening area would decrease by up to 3 m, but the vertical opening area would increase by 1m.
w8239e24.jpg (29903 byte)
Of course, when the speeds are the same, the opening area varies and due to the influence of external factors, differences in the size of the area of net openings were recorded as ± 1 and 0.05m in the horizontal and vertical openings respectively.
One of the crucial issues pertinent to midwater trawling is adjustment of the the trawl net to the depth of the fish distribution. This is crucial with respect to catching fishes such as myctophids which usually migrate vertically. Making such an adjustment to the vertical migration of the school of the target lanternfishes, is difficult, especially in the morning and in the afternoon when the fishes change depth at high speeds.
Figure 45 shows the steps of towing depth during the trial fishing in terms of RPM and length of the trawl warps.

Thus, in developing and designing mid-water trawls for capture of myctophids, it is important to consider the hauling power of the net with the towing speed, and there should be a reserve of hauling power. Catch volume of the fish depends mainly on the towing speed of the net.
Table 19
Myctophid catch volume in relation to towing speed
Towing speed
m/s
km
Catch volume
t/h
As it is illustrated in the Table, because of the small size of the fish and lower rate of its swimming speed, the appropriate fishing speed might be between 1.2 and 1.4 m/s. Therefore, it will be a sound decision if the towing speed of the net is adjusted within 2.5 ± 0.3 kn. There was a comparison between catch volume and towing time the results of which are shown in Table 20.
Table 20
Myctophid catch volume in relation to towing time
Towing time
(minutes)
Catch volume
(t/h)
To ensure of the accuracy of the rate comparing the catch, data were analyzed of the catches from 70 tows which were carried out during late November and early March in Jask and Ghirishkin areas, where the school of myctophids had a uniform and dense distribution. Further, because of the existence of a great difference between the catch volume during day and night times, the data of night catch were excluded from the analyses. As the table shows, when the time of towing is decreased, the amount of catch is increased. Because of this trend, it is believed that it will be economical if, in proportion to catch, we increase the frequencies of fishing operations and fix the towing time within the limit of one to two hours in considering the factors such as the density, as well as the size, of the schools of the fish.
7.2 Fish meal production
After capture, the lanternfishes were processed into fish meal. Since the fish meal plant of vessel was not suitable for processing these small fishes, it couldn't operate at full capacity that the actual yield of fish meal was not high.
When we look at the actual ratio of fish meal production during the trial fishing, it was found that yield was 10% of the raw material. If appropriate machinery is used, it seems possible to increase the yield to more than 13%.
The crucial issue in producing myctophid fish meal is the preservation of the raw product. Since the temperature of the store during late November is not usually very high, it is possible to provide the required coldness for 5 hours without operating the chiller. But, during summer, when the temperature exceeds 40^oC, the chiller must be operated for more than 6 hours to prevent the raw material from rotting in order to increase the yield and improve the quality of the fish meal as well as maintain fish meal production continuously.
7.3 Results
During 6 months research was carried out during four experimental and research cruises in the Gulf of Oman on the Iranian side. The following results were obtained:
i. In deep waters (>150m) and offshore regions (about 10nm from the coastline), myctophid schools were observed in all the regions. The greatest abundance was observed between Ras'lkuh and Meidani areas in depths of 150-200m.
ii. The biomass was assessed at 1 000 000t in the area up to 50nm from coastline and 2000 000t in the areas up to 90nm from the coastline.
iii. Lantern fishes have short life spans but there are always good resources of these fishes in the region because of their high fecundity and if fishermen increase their fishing efforts, it can be assumed that enough recruitments will occur.
iv. It is recommended that fishing of lantern fish should be done using a midwater trawler equipped with a powerful main engine (1500hp) and Gross Reg. Tonnage of 1000 tonnes.
The vessel should be equipped with the following equipments:
- trawl winch (speed = 1 m/s)
- powerful net drum (pulling 30 tonnes catch)
- echo sounder and sonar
- fishmeal plan
- refrigerator system (enahle to freeze 30t raw material from +40^oC to -20^oC)
- fishmeal store with capacity of 100t.
5) The best mesh size of the codend is recommended as 2a = 9 mm.
6) The recommended hauling speed is 2.5 km (2.2-2.8 km).
7) If dense schools of lantern fish are found, it can be possible to produce 130t fishmeal from 1000t of raw material.

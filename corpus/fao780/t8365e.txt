<title>ADCP/REP/89/40 - A Regional Survey of the Aquaculture Sector in the Caribbean</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
Aquaculture continues to grow in economic importance. The main reason for this is the quantifiable contribution aquaculture is making in many countries to fill the growing gap between supply and demand for fisheries products. This gap continues to widen because of increasing human populations and the static growth rates of capture fisheries brought about by declines in stocks and the increasing cost of obtaining fish through conventional methods. Although this gap can (and in some cases is already) being met by alternatives, such as inexpensive poultry and white meats, aquaculture particularly provides consumers with a choice of fresh products.
Aquaculture is also evident in earning foreign exchange for many countries through the export of high-value products. It also creates employment, particularly in economically depressed coastal and remote regions, and contributes Co the household economy of rural farmers.
This tenth regional survey prepared by the Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) covers the existing aquaculture sector in the countries of the Caribbean region, namely Anguila, Antigua-Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands.
This present survey is not exhaustive. It has been prepared by Philippe Ferlin and Pedro Noriega-Curtis in a relatively brief desk study. They have been helped, however, by the many national aquaculture coordinators and administrators who undertook similar national reviews as part of preparatory planning studies organized by the Support for Aquaculture Activities in Latin America and the Caribbean project (AQUILA). This group gathered for a technical meeting on Aquaculture Planning in Caracas, Venezuela, in May 1989. This ADCP review was therefore delayed until this large body of information was assembled, particularly as, for the most part, it had been collected on the sectoral framework prepared by ADCP. The contributions of these individuals through the region are therefore gratefully acknowledged.
For some countries of this newly active aquaculture region detailed information is still difficult to obtain. The ADCP apologizes for any omissions and errors which may exist in the survey, and hopes that these can be corrected in an up-dated survey. New information and notification of changes and errors should be indicated to ADCP in the Fisheries Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome. The detailed table of contents illustrates the range of information which, hopefully, will be assembled in due course for all regions.
The survey is directed toward administrators, executives, and managers who require broad overviews, rather than for scientists and technologists who require detailed information about species and practices. It is the tenth and last of a series of regional surveys. To this end, the ADCP hopes that the reader will find the information described here useful.

INTRODUCTION
The Caribbean region described in this survey is implied in a restricted sense. It does not include the continental countries but only the islands of the region with the exception of Puerto Rico which, as a territory associated with USA, is included in the survey of North America (see ADCP/REP/89/37).
The countries included in the sectoral survey are:
Anguila
Antigua-Barbuda
Bahamas
Barbados
Bermuda
Cayman Islands
Cuba
Dominica
Dominican Republic
Grenada
Guadeloupe
Haiti
Jamaica
Martinique
Montserrat
Netherlands Antilles
St. Christopher and Nevis
St. Lucia
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Trinidad and Tobago
Turks and Caicos Islands
US Virgin Islands
British Virgin Islands
The 23 countries can be sub-divided geopolitically in a number of ways.
(1) Seventeen are English-speaking countries which belong to the Commonwealth (with the exception of the US Virgin Islands), and ten of them are members of Caribbean Economic Community (CARICOM), namely, Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Six countries are not independent sovereign states, namely Anguila, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Turks and Caicos Islands, British Virgin Islands, but are British territories, and US Virgin Islands, a territory associated with USA. Two countries are independent Spanish-speaking countries, namely Cuba and Dominican Republic, and are the most important in the region in terms of surface area (70%), population (56%), and gross national product (GNP) (45%).
(2) Three countries are overseas territories or regions of countries of the European Economic Community (EEC), namely Guadeloupe and Martinique (France), and Netherlands Antilles (the Netherlands). These countries have special financial advantages because of this association.
(3) One country, namely Haiti, is a French-speaking country; it was the first independent country of the region in 1804.
The countries can also be divided into two main geographic groups:
(4) The Greater Antilles, namely Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, which together have 88% of the total surface area and 88% of the total population of the region.
(5) The Lesser Antilles, which include the other 19 countries, and of which Trinidad and Tobago has one third of their total population.

1.1 Nutritional benefits of fish and shellfish
First and foremost, increasing the per caput consumption of fish and shellfish in any country benefits health. Aquatic animals contain a high level of protein (17-20%), with an amino-acid profile similar to that of the meat of land-animals. The flesh of fish is therefore readily digestible and immediately utilizable by the human body. Compared with land animals (with some exceptions, such as shellfish), aquatic animals have a far higher percentage of edible flesh, and there is little wastage. Aquatic animals are a source of minerals, such as calcium, iron, and phosphorus, as well as trace elements and vitamins. Marine species are particularly rich in iodine. The fatty-acid content is high in poly-unsaturates, and particularly those which are attributed to reduce blood cholesterol.
1.2 Characteristics of consumption in the region
Fish has played a central role in the food economy of man from early times. The development of civilizations in the Caribbean islands was undoubtedly influenced by the availability of fish and shellfish found in the surrounding waters. The Carib Indians included fish with their staples, maize and cassava, which, together with beans, fruits, and vegetables, constituted a well-balanced diet.
Fish constitutes a traditional element of the diet of most Caribbean people and cannot be easily substituted by other foods. Fish is preferred in a fresh whole form, although salted dried fish is well accepted in some islands. Processed forms are bought in larger quantities due to greater availability and sometimes cheaper prices. Fish imports into the region comprise a wide range of species and product forms, mostly dried, smoked, salt-dried, gutted, iced, and canned.
In the Lesser Antilles the demersal fishes (snappers and groupers) are the most appreciated variety but imported salted cod (from Canada, France, and Norway) is also important as it is used in the preparation of many traditional dishes. In Martinique about one-quarter of the total fish consumption is salted cod. In most country islands fish is regularly a part of the daily diet served with rice and local vegetables, and it is usually boiled and heavily spiced.
In the Greater Antilles most fish are acceptable without preference for those of demersal or pelagic origin. Some freshwater fishes, namely the tilapias, carps, and colossomids have recently become popular. In fact, in countries like Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, the growth and transformation of the productive structure of fish farming have had a strong impact on the marketing and consumption of fish.
The use of salted cod throughout the English-speaking Caribbean countries as an economical source of protein during colonial times has established it firmly in the local diets of the region. Complex economic factors combined with traditional eating habits continue to affect the pattern of fish consumption. Thus, although markets for processed fish products exist, the potential for penetrating them through aquaculture remains a challenging enterprise.
Molluscs, on the other hand, are not a traditional part of the diet, with the exception of the stromboid queen conch and the mangrove oyster consumed mainly in Cuba and Jamaica.
Crustaceans are scarce and seldom consumed locally. They have become a valuable export commodity in most islands, particularly spiny lobsters. In the Greater Antilles freshwater prawns are consumed by the local population, although at present they are all being channelled to the local tourist trade due to their high value.
The increase in revenue per caput in some of the Caribbean islands, and the development of the tourist trade, have changed many of the socio-cultural habits of the indigenous populations. The consumption of imported frozen and smoked fish is increasing, particularly in the richer countries.
1.3 Annual consumption of fish and shellfish
The Caribbean region, as described, has a population of some 29.6 million people. Fish supplies (from all sources) amount to some 400 000 t per annum. The average annual fish consumption is about 14.1 kg per caput (see Table 1, Annex I), but there is a large difference between the Greater Antilles (with an average annual consumption of 12.7 kg/y/caput) and the Lesser Antilles (with 23.9 kg/y/caput).
Protein supply in the region is above the daily world average amount per caput, with the exception of Haiti (3.7 g/day/caput)) and the Dominican Republic (6.8 g/day/caput). Fish protein supply varies between 14% of total animal protein (Haiti and Bahamas) and about 50% (Martinique, Guadeloupe, and St. Christopher). With the exception of Haiti all countries of the region are at or above minimal standard of food requirements (in calories and proteins).
The nominal catch for the region as a whole for 1986 was over 300 000 t. This figure includes all marine and freshwater fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, of which Cuba landed 71%, followed by the Dominican Republic (6.7%). Jamaica, Guadeloupe, and Haiti contributed with over 2.5% each.
Of the total catch about 33 000 t (11.2%) were exported with a value of US$ 233 million. Individual countries differ in export earnings relative to gross export volume depending on their specific product range. Cuba was the leading exporting country with 23 912 t (value US$ 180 million), followed by the Cayman Islands (2 711 t and US$ 18.6 million), Bahamas (1 223 t and US$ 17.9 million), Grenada (1 860 t and US$ 2.9 million), and Dominican Republic (1 862 t and US$ 2.3 million).
Recorded data indicate that fish landings in the early 1960s are only just greater than the early 1980s, although the population has increased by about 20%. Shrimp landings show sizeable increases for the period, although most of the catch was exported. The increase in demand for fish was in the form of salted cod, sardines, smoked herrings, and mackerels, all of which constitute the main imports of fisheries products to the region. Total imports now stand at about 122 500 t, with a value of US$ 182 million.

The region as a whole is a net importer of fisheries products. It imports over 122 000 t and exports just over 33 000 t. Fisheries, however, is a net generator of foreign exchange, with earnings exceeding US$ 51 million annually.
With increasing personal incomes, population rates, and tourist trade (with its associated high consumption of seafoods), the demand for fish and fisheries products in the region is projected to increase substantially.
1.4 Gross market data
The Caribbean is described as having a middle-rich economy, with an average GNP/caput of US$ 1 280 (see Table 2). Only Haiti is below US$ 400 and ten countries are above US$ 3 000/caput. There is a significant difference between the countries of the Greater Antilles (US$ 821/caput) and the Lesser Antilles (US$ 4 734/caput). The total GNP of the Greater Antilles with a total population of 26 million is about equal to that of the Lesser Antilles with a population of only 3.5 million.
Regional and national fisheries statistics in the region are available but not reliable. No regional statistical recording system exists. A large part of national fisheries catches are consumed directly by fishermen themselves or by coastal communities. Between the richer islands and the others there is a "black market" and much fish is sold offshore by fishermen to buyers from the richer islands as the prices offered are often two or three times greater than prices (often fixed by governments) in their home country.
Throughout the region as a whole it is generally accepted that the inshore marine fisheries cannot increase. The traditional fishing grounds are over-exploited, and present policies derived from the adoption of the Extended Economic Zones (EEZ), whereby coastal states are now responsible for the effective management of the marine resources lying within their zones of jurisdiction, prevent the development of distant water fishing in neighbouring countries' EEZs. Although increases in catches through regional pelagic fisheries are possible, the limited and scattered availability of these marine resources usually render their exploitation uneconomical.
The total population of the Caribbean region, as described, is about 29.6 million, of which 25 million live in the Greater Antilles. Each year the tourist industry adds approximately a further 6.5 million to the market place. Tourism is important to the region and in the Lesser Antilles by country it contributes between 4 and 50% of the total GNP. Fisheries, on the other hand, contribute between 0.5 and 30% but typically only 1-3% in most countries.
The estimated demand by the tourist trade is not important at a regional level. A total of 6.5 million tourists spending about 7 days each in the region is equivalent to only 125 000 full-time residents. Recent studies indicate an average consumption of fish and fisheries products by tourists of 50-100 kg/y/caput. or 6 250-12 500 t for the whole tourist industry. However, for the Lesser Antilles this demand represents a large part of the total demand; for example, in the Bahamas there are over 44 000 tourists annually and about 234 000 residents, and in Cayman Islands there are almost 6 000 tourists annually and 18 000 residents. In addition, the tourist demand is concentrated on the high-value and high-priced products, such as lobsters, shrimps, conches, snappers, and groupers.
The Caribbean countries have maintained an increase in their fish landings during the last few years amounting to over 300 000 t in 1987 (see Table 3). In spite of a decrease in their export value in 1984 (US$ 122 million) a recovery took place later on, reaching US$ 233 million in 1987, i.e. an increase of 90%.
The leading Caribbean commercial fisheries are red snapper, grouper, croaker, dolphin fish, conch, spiny lobster, and shrimp, all of which are exported by air, either fresh or chilled, frozen, or live. However, some of the obstacles to acceptance of these products are the lack of continuity in supply, inconsistent product quality, difficulties with letters of credit, and scheduling of agreed delivery dates. All these factors result in a lack of reliability and credibility, and also discredit other potential exporters and even the country per se from where shipments originate.
1.5 Specific market data
In most of the islands of the Lesser Antilles there is no functional marketing organization for fish and fishery products. Most fish are sold on the beaches and on the sides of coastal roads, often without benefit of a stall. This is typical of Grenada, Dominica, Anguila, and Bermuda. Wholesale and retail companies exist in Jamaica, French West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti, and in Cuba where the organization is public.
In some countries, such as St. Vincent and St. Lucia, there are fish markets in the largest centres of population. In the more advanced countries, such as Trinidad, Antigua-Barbuda, Cuba, Jamaica, and Martinique, retail fish shops, are becoming more common and sell not only local fresh fish but also imported fresh and frozen fish. In Martinique, for example, the number of retailing shops in Fort-de-France has increased from one (in 1980) to eleven. Imported preserved fish are sold at supermarkets and other retail shops.
The most popular species of fish in the market place are the demersal snappers and groupers. The large pelagic fish, such as the tunas and dolphin fish, are also considered prime fish and preferred by consumers, especially between January and June. In the Greater Antilles some freshwater fish are popular on the markets, such as the tilapias in Jamaica, and armoured catfish or cascadora in Trinidad. Shellfish, such as the marine lobsters, shrimps, and conches, are exported or retained for the demands of the tourist trade.
Prices of fish and shellfish vary greatly from one island to the other. For example, average prime fresh fish prices (1985, ex-vessel) in US$/kg were 0.41-2.20 in St. Vincent, 2.40 in St. Lucia, 1.06 in Barbados, and 4.50 (2.50-8.00) in Martinique. Conch prices (ex-vessel) were US $ 1.80/kg in Turks and Caicos, 2.00 in St. Vincent, and 26.00 in Martinique. Lobster prices were US$ 4.40/kg in Turks and Caicos, 4.10 in St. Vincent, and 20.00 in Martinique. Freshwater tilapia was sold at US$ 1.20/kg in Jamaica, and US$ 1.00/kg in St. Vincent.
Local fish and shellfish are sold fresh when marketed locally. In Cuba, Jamaica, and Trinidad part of the catch is often processed into fillets, or canned, or frozen. In Guadeloupe there is a small smoking factory for pelagic fish (balacu, swordfish, and kingfish).
Imported fish are usually frozen or salted (cod), although some is fresh and iced. Lobster (heads off) and conches (without shell) are exported frozen. Cuba is exporting part of its catch, particularly high-value fish and shellfish (first-category fish, lobsters, and shrimps) and imports low-value fish.
For the period 1984-86, average exports of fishery products from the region amounted to 15% of the total catch but were worth over 50% of the total value of all landings. Imports, on the other hand, amounted to almost 50% of the total fish supply available for direct human consumption, and consisted mainly of fish either dried, salted or smoked, and secondly, of fish products and preparations (whether or not in airtight containers). Cuba, however, is the major sole importer in the region of fish in fresh, chilled, or frozen forms. Crustaceans and molluscs are imported in only small quantities.
Most of the governments of the islands aim at self-sufficiency in fish production. Some, such as Antigua, try to prohibit exports; others, such as Jamaica and Trinidad, limit imports. All of them are giving more attention to post-harvest practices both at sea and on shore, processing and storage, and to improved marketing and distribution. Many are now more interested in assessment of their resources, and collecting statistics to determine the best management practices to sustain the stocks.
Also, because most Caribbean countries depend mainly on marine catches for their local supply of fish products, and because the commonly harvested marine resources have begun to show signs of depletion, governments are starting to recognize the importance of aquaculture as an alternative to food production through the exploitation of under-utilized resources.
In addition, the rising costs of landing wild stocks occasioned by oil crises, and the depletion of natural stocks together with improved techniques of aquaculture through selection, breeding and management, have led to renewed interest in aquaculture in the region. A change from past failures to future success rests upon finding adequate solutions to the production and distribution problems.
With the exception of penaeid shrimps aquaculture pursuits in the region are mainly centred on fresh or brackishwater species which are unfamiliar to many potential consumers. However, only a few species (such as tilapia, common and Chinese carps, cascadura, etc.) have been readily accepted in the region.
CARICOM, through the Caribbean Food Corporation, has addressed the issue of marketing surplus fish within the region, as transportation, pricing, availability of foreign exchange, and consumer acceptance of surplus species constitute obstacles to interregional trade.
The problems facing some of the countries which have surplus/deficit catches are summarized in the table on page 9.
1.6 Information for the trade
There is no specific source of marketing information for the Caribbean region. The countries have proximity to information in both Latin America and North America. The principal marketing information service in the Latin America region is INFOPESCA, although it does not as yet differentiate aquaculture products. INFOPESCA assists the fishing industry and governments in the region by establishing contacts between buyers and sellers of fish products, and providing technical information and advice on post-harvest aspects of fisheries, such as handling, processing, equipment selection, and quality assurance. INFOPESCA is based in Panama City, and its working languages are English and Spanish.
INFOPESCA is one of four regional services (in Africa, Asia/Pacific, and the Near East in addition). This network of services produces a two-weekly news bulletin called "Trade News", in English, French, Spanish and Arabic. This deals with prices, cold storage holdings, short-term market trends, and business opportunities. The network also publishes a two-monthly magazine called "INFOFISH International" (incorporating the Marketing Digest) in English, which contains articles on market analysis, new products, processing, packaging, equipment, and other aspects of fisheries including aquaculture, with summaries in he other three languages. Again, as yet, little information is relevant to aquaculture in the Caribbean.

The fifth member of the network service is the FAO computerized system of fish marketing called Globefish. This database stores original information collected by INFOPESCA and the other regional services, on such things as production and trade statistics, price series, the supply and demand situation, information on aquaculture, investment, joint ventures, and general economic data relevant to fisheries. Specific searches are made on request. FAO also produces "Globefish Highlights", which is a quarterly analysis of medium trends. It is based on the information in the databank and is distributed as a supplement to the Trade News (above) in four languages.
Annual fishery statistics are also stored on an FAO database called FISHDAB. As yet aquaculture statistics are not separated.
Consumer and marketing information is through international magazines and trade papers which are obtainable on subscription. Most of these at the present time deal with capture fisheries, but a number of articles appear about aquaculture periodically. In the region there is "Mar y Pesca" (Cuba), and in the proximal region "Pesca Marina" (Costa Rica). "Chile Pesquero" (Chile), "Pesca - Revista de Circulacion Mundial" (Peru), and "Redes de la Industria Pesquera Nacional" (Argentina).
Magazines useful to the region related to North American and European markets are "Seafood Business" (USA), "Seafood International" (UK), and "Il Pesce" (Italy), and product newsletters, like Shrimp Newsletter (USA).
Regarding international market quotations for aquaculture products, the Commercial Fishing Information System handled by INFOPESCA processes and distributes through its reports the prices of some cultured species, in addition to specifying their presentation and preservation forms, the type of market, and the origin of the products. At present, quotations for cultured shrimps, tilapia, common and Chinese carps, eel, salmon, trout, catfish, and seaweeds are occasionally published. It also offers technical and commercial assistance in marketing operations for placing traditional products at better price levels, as well as introducing and maintaining new products until they are able to establish a position in international markets.
The National Marine Fishery Service of the US Department of Commerce publishes a Fishery Market News Report three times a week with information on primary wholesale selling prices for shrimp and fish and other selected wholesale frozen fishery products in the principal fish markets of New York, Boston, Portland, etc. It also gives information on imports entered into the New York Customs District and provides additional services such as listings of available trade opportunities, and various reports of the fishing industry. This Market Report is relevant to the region as it provides an indication of prices of various commodities imported from the Caribbean.
All these commercial publications are available through subscription and, in addition to prices and market trends, they contain relevant articles on aquaculture production world-wide.
1.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
There have been a number of technical assistance projects in the region in recent years dealing with aspects of marketing, but all have been associated with the offshore fisheries sector, and not aquaculture. Some have involved facilities for post-harvest handling and processing, which may indirectly benefit the aquaculture sector.
As in most of the other regions, marketing is invariably a component omitted from technical assistance projects and therefore there are few projects in the region with components at this level of the aquaculture sector.
The most important project is INFOPESCA - a marketing and advisory service specializing in Latin American and Caribbean fisheries. INFOPESCA is part of a network of marketing services established by FAO in four regions (see 1.6). This regional service has been rather restricted in its coverage within the Caribbean although it is expected to play a more important role as the sector develops.
In 1976 the 10th West Indies Agricultural Economics Conference addressed the matter and a study was conducted on prospects for intraregional trade in fish products.
In response to the need for data on food composition, the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute has conducted a number of studies on local fishery products. In terms of marketing, this information has proved to be of value to government personnel in the control of imports of foodstuffs, as it has appraised their value, and in fixing import duties. Among the species studied, some products of aquaculture, such as tilapia, carps, catfish, shrimp, and oysters have been included.
The Tropical Products Institute of London has also reviewed possibilities for wholesaling and retailing fish in the Caribbean.
Through the FAO-sponsored "Organization and Management Training for Aquaculture Development" project, a regional workshop was held in 1987 in which it was recognized that a market potential for aquaculture products from the Caribbean exists and that market analyses and consumer acceptance surveys play an important role in fostering successful aquaculture development. Therefore, a request was made to the CARICOM Secretariat to assist member governments with appropriate programmes to achieve production and marketing objectives for aquaculture development. The workshop also proposed the organization of regional and national seminars on various topics among which marketing of aquaculture products was included with the rationale of enabling participants to acquire basic marketing principles for the proper promotion and disposal of aquaculture products. The main goals of these proposed seminars would be to propitiate an increased understanding of the basic concepts of marketing as
applied to aquaculture in the global, regional, and national environments. Also to acquire the tools for determining consumer behaviour, develop marketing strategies for aquaculture products, and for planning and financial control.
As a means of developing expertise in marketing, which is considered to be a constraining factor for the expansion of aquaculture within the Caribbean, the Workshop provided officers from CARICOM countries and representatives from regional training and research institutions with orientation and insights on problems in market development for aquaculture products.
Local and national market surveys for fisheries and aquaculture products have been conducted in various countries of the region. These have either been contracted directly by governments with private commercial firms, or as components of external technical assistance projects; for example, in Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, Martinique, and Barbados.

2.1 Characteristics of production in the region
The Greater Antilles, with a total surface area of 201 970 km^2, are substantial land masses ranging between 114 524 km^2 (Cuba) and 10 962 km^2 (Jamaica) and have both freshwater resources as well as good, protected brackish and coastal environments appropriate for aquaculture production.
In these countries production is based mainly on the cultivation of tilapias and carps as inexpensive sources of protein for local consumption, and of freshwater prawns, oysters and, more recently, penaeid shrimps to supply the tourist and local restaurant trade as well as for exports to generate foreign currency.
The biogeographic environments characteristic of the region offer limited possibilities for the development of freshwater aquaculture, especially in the Lesser Antilles where freshwater resources and flat land are scarce (see Table 4). Moreover the native inland aquatic fauna is not rich and, as none of the native species seems suitable for cultivation, aquaculture in turn will have to depend on the limited range of introduced species which can be adapted to the local prevailing conditions.
Due to these natural constraints, and to the high demand for seafood, aquaculture projects are mainly devoted to the production of high-value species.
2.2 Regional production data
The gross production of aquaculture in the region in 1986 stood at about 20 000 t. Cuba alone contributed with 80% (16 835 t) of which 15 356 t were freshwater fish (namely tilapia) produced through culture-based fisheries practised in its nearly 1 000 km^2 of water impoundments and reservoirs. The production in the region is summarized in the following table, and a list of species cultivated in the region and summary of activities are given in Table 5, Annex I:
In Cuba fish production has increased on average 8.2% throughout the present decade, aquaculture having contributed significantly. Although the annual population growth rate has been 1%, fish consumption has increased by 4.6%. The national food programme attempts to furnish enough protein intake through the supply of fish, especially to areas and population centres where other protein sources are less readily accessible. Processed and canned fish products marketed increased from 36.6% in 1976-80 to 56.2% in 1981-84.
The second largest producer is Jamaica where aquaculture has established itself as a viable industry. Production is entirely based on the culture of Tilapia nilotica, or its red hybrid, which have had good acceptability among consumers in both rural and urban markets and the tourist trade.

Freshwater fish culture in general does not look like becoming a self-sustaining economic activity in the smaller islands. Marine aquaculture, on the other hand, may be more important for the region as a whole as is demonstrated by the increasing production of both crustaceans and molluscs and, more recently, by marine fish species.
Although not necessarily significant in terms of total volumes produced, small-scale aquaculture is practised in many countries of the region. This practice makes up production (predominantly tilapia, carps, armoured catfish, colossoma, and prawns) which is consumed locally, typically at source or in the coastal/rural areas.
Production of molluscs is also increasing throughout the region as technologies for their culture are disseminated to producers. This has been spurred by the fact that most natural beds of molluscs have been over-exploited as a consequence of the traditionally high demand both internally and abroad. Concern over the decline of stocks has led to extensive research on the mass rearing of juveniles to re-establish or replenish depleted natural populations.
Semi-intensive culture of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae) is presently practised in Cuba (1 134 t), Jamaica (12 t), Grenada (10 t), and more recently in the Dominican Republic. The queen conch (Strombus gigas) is the other mollusc species being cultured in the region. 360 t are reportedly produced on a commercial scale in Turks and Caicos.
Although it had been anticipated that among the crustaceans the freshwater prawn would become the most important species in terms of aquaculture, producers and investors have turned their attention toward the cultivation of penaeid shrimp. Its production is rapidly increasing, especially due to the considerable number of foreign investors and institutions which are becoming involved in its cultivation in the region. Local governments are recognizing the importance of this activity as a means of generating foreign exchange and are therefore encouraging investment in this sector. Production of Macrobrachium rosenbergii is well established in the Dominican Republic (117 t), Guadeloupe (46 t), and Martinique (54 t), where the French Government has financed several assistance projects (see Sections 2.8 and 3.9). In the former country Macrobrachium production is channelled to the local tourist trade while that of Guadeloupe and Martinique is mainly exported to France. There have
been a few attempts to produce the king crab (Mithrax spinosissimus), notably in Antigua and Grenada, although they have not gone beyond the experimental phase.
2.3 Production systems and practices in the region
In the Caribbean the present production systems and practices are the result of the adaptive research conducted by the governmental counterpart agencies in receipt of foreign technical assistance projects. These research efforts have generally been oriented toward devising a system which would produce aquatic organisms as efficiently as the geographical, physical, cultural, and financial conditions of each particular island would permit.
In Jamaica the system of tilapia farming thus devised under the assistance of two projects supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) entails production stages and management practices for breeding, nursery, and grow-out. This semi-intensive system has proved successful insofar as production of food fish has been undertaken by different categories of entrepreneurs whose technical and financial capabilities vary widely. The practices are flexible and can be adjusted easily to physical conditions of sites and different requirements of farmers.
Extensive and subsistence level fish farms in most countries (e.g. Haiti, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago) generally operate at a financial loss. However, because outlays are minimal, farmers continue to operate and produce fish to complement their families' diets and/or incomes.
The dramatic increase in production of tilapia from 2.2 t in 1977 to 2 600 t in 1987 may be attributed to the Government of Jamaica/USAID Inland Fisheries Project. Tilapia farming was successfully introduced although the initial primary objective to promote rural development through small-scale aquaculture was not fully realized. At present, the commercial sector is shaping the evolution of aquaculture. Profitability and rate of return on investment, the national policy of diversification of agriculture, availability of credit, institutional support, coupled with a realistic research, training, and extension programme, are among factors which have contributed to the success.
In general most tilapia farms in Jamaica are similar in design with variations attributed to specific site characteristics. The basic design consists of a set of ponds draining into an open central channel from which the water can be recycled when a new production cycle is initiated. Fry are harvested weekly from breeding ponds and stocked in nursery ponds where they are fed and grown until they reach a size at which they can be visually sorted by sexes. Male monosex culture is practised in grow-out ponds where fish are fed a pelleted commercial feed. Market size fish are harvested by seining the pond during drainage. Yields from production ponds range from 1.5-4.5 t/ha/crop. Production of all-male fingerlings through the use of hormone sex reversal techniques is now widely used in the tilapia farming industry.
Marketing of fish is still very dependent on "higglers", or local middlemen, although an improved organized system of marketing and distribution of tilapia both to rural and urban areas is now underway.
Commercial aquaculture operations in general use more labour, fertilizer, and supplemental feeds than small-scale operations. In many instances production costs tend to be reduced through more intensive use of organic manure and other agro-industrial wastes as sources of fertilizer and feed.
Aquaculture development in Cuba stems from the decision taken by the Government in 1963 following the devastating damage of hurricanes. The Government constructed dams and reservoirs for flood control and irrigation purposes during prolonged droughts. Since the early 1970s some of the newly built reservoirs were stocked with tilapia fingerings (Oreochromis aureus and O. mossambicus) bred in state hatcheries of the Inland Water Restocking Centre. Eventually the 100 000 ha of impounded waters have been stocked on a regular basis by the National Aquaculture Enterprise. Aquaculture systems fall under three categories of extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive farming. The first two refer to culture-based fisheries practised in large dams and medium-sized reservoirs. The extensive system is based entirely on the natural productivity as the sole source of feed for the fish, while in semi-intensive systems water impoundments are fertilized to increase their productivity. Intensive
systems are used in ponds not larger than 10 ha, as well as in pens and cages, where artificial supplementary feeds are utilized and stocking densities are much higher.
In the Dominican Republic culture-based fisheries are becoming well established practices in the 15 000 ha of water impoundments which produce some 656 t of tilapia, carp, and black bass (Micropterus salmoides). A well developed practice is the farming of the freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) with a yearly production of 118 t in 118 ha of earthen ponds operated at both commercial and semi-commercial scales. In both cases prawns are produced under intensive conditions, the main difference being the size of the farm and ponds, and the level of vertical integration. Commercial-scale operations generally include a hatchery for the supply of post-larvae (PLs).
In the Greater Antilles marine shrimp farming is evolving rapidly. In Cuba research on the reproduction of two native species (Penaeus schmitti and P. notialis) started in 1970. Toward 1985 a National Plan for the Development of Shrimp Farming was launched by the Fishing Industry Ministry and is under implementation by a public enterprise. Three hatcheries are expected to supply PLs to operate farms with a total area of 1 000 ha located in three provinces of the country. In 1987, 345 t of shrimp were produced, and in 1988 over 500 t.
In the Dominican Republic four shrimp farms have initiated operations and in 1988 produced 240 t of P. monodon, P. vannamei, and P. schmitti.
Foreign investors have conducted feasibility studies for the production of shrimp in various countries of the region (e.g. Antigua, Jamaica, Haiti, the Bahamas, St. Christopher, and the US Virgin Islands) with mixed success.
In the Bahamas a US-based company conducted a pilot project for an intensive shrimp farm using solar salt ponds. Although the company was forced to suspend its operations in 1986 due to financial difficulties, it demonstrated that yields of up to 8 t/ha/y could be realized.
In the Cayman Islands the Government has purchased the former Cayman Turtle Farm and is considering the possibility of transforming it into a model farm for the promotion of shrimp farming in the country.
Extensive marine systems are also practised in the region. These include the cultivation of seaweeds, mangrove oysters, and queen conch.
The seaweed Gracilaria, locally known as "sea moss", is produced in St. Lucia. Research on the culture of sea moss started in 1981. Preliminary studies were aimed at developing a methodology which would use simple technology while not requiring a heavy labour input. The results of tests led to the adoption of the raft system for all aspects of commercial production. The bamboo rafts, usually about 3 × 2 m, hold ten polypropylene lines all seeded with inoculum. These are anchored in place over sites previously selected as suitable for propagation.
The culture of mangrove oyster (Crassostrea rhizophorae), as practised in Jamaica, consists of floating rafts made of bamboo poles and oil drums anchored by nylon ropes to concrete blocks. Spat collectors made of pieces of old car tyres are strung together with monofilament line and hung from bamboo and mangrove racks in the intertidal zone. Once the naturally occurring larvae have settled, the collectors are hung from floating rafts located in sites in sheltered coastal areas appropriate for nursing and feeding.
In Cuba farming facilities for oyster culture consist of stockades of palm posts driven into muddy or sandy bottoms which support wooden transverse beams. Branches of red mangrove, suspended from the beams by tarred ropes or monofilament nylon thread, are used as spat collectors. These collectors, located in estuarine areas, are checked and cleaned periodically until the oysters are harvested 6 months later. Production at present reaches over 1 300 t/y and is partially supported by controlled hatchery-produced spat.
The queen conch (Strombus gigas) is cultured by extensive systems only in Turks and Caicos. It is cultured more intensively in the Bahamas, Netherlands Antilles (Bonaire), the US Virgin Islands, and in Martinique, where hatcheries have been constructed to repopulate over-fished beds. Hatchery reared juveniles are released in either protective cages or enclosures, or directly onto the open sea bottom to replenish depleted natural populations which, in many countries of the region, formerly sustained important subsistence level fisheries.
Several problems still hamper Caribbean aquaculture. These include insufficient biological information on potential candidate species, dependency on wild seed (spat, juveniles, and PLs), lack of economic information, few trained technicians, inadequate marketing channels, low primary productivity in many areas, and pollution and public health considerations.
In the Lesser Antilles in general, due to unfavourable topography, little rainfall, shortage of experienced manpower, lack of freshwater and land suitable for pond construction, a scarcity of local ingredients for fish feeds, freshwater fish culture has not evolved much or contributed to the supply of food for human consumption. Culture practices which make more intensive use of land and water, such as tilapia culture in tanks or polyculture in association with poultry, pig or cattle farming, are proving to be more attractive economically and feasible.
Marine culture appears to be a better option for the development of the sector, particularly in smaller islands. However, vulnerability to hurricanes, low tidal ranges, and low nutrient content of the waters limit to a certain extent the culture systems which can be used. Intensive marine systems in combination with species selection and other economic considerations minimize many of the risks posed by the natural conditions and, at the same time, are compatible with production objectives.
A few countries, such as Martinique, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Cuba, are experimenting with the culture of marine fish in floating cages. Although there are no hatcheries for the production of fingerlings, the grow-out phase in most cases has proved successful both technically and economically. Species produced include the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), dolphin fish (Coryphaena spp.), and tilapia.
In addition to the practices described for tilapia, and common and Chinese carps, production of freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) has become widespread in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Haiti. Several smaller pilot projects have been conducted in other islands as a means of increasing food production for the supply of local and tourist markets, and in some cases to generate foreign exchange. Production is usually in excavated earthen ponds either alone or in polyculture.
In the French Antilles the continuous cropping and restocking system is widely used, while most other countries prefer batch culture whereby ponds are drained periodically. In both cases, PLs are reared at densities of 10-20 individuals/m^2 and are fed supplementary formulated feeds. Reproduction and larval rearing in hatcheries have become widespread practices adapted to local conditions. Hatcheries vary considerably in size and sophistication of technology, from small cottage-industry family operations to large complex commercial units, with water treatment and recirculating systems and capacities of up to one million PLs per month.
Colossoma spp. and armoured catfish (Haplosternum littorale) are two freshwater fish which offer good potential for warmwater pond aquaculture in some of the countries. Both are readily acceptable and in demand in local markets of Cuba, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
2.4 Producers in the region
Producers in the region can be classified into four principal groups: corporate or industrial producers; small-scale private farmers (usually owner-operators of small farms, complementary to other agricultural activities); rural farmers (non-commercial, with family-based land and households with few resources); and artisanal fishermen who benefit from aquaculture through the government-operated culture-based fisheries.
In Jamaica, and other countries, aquaculture has been viewed not only as a means of increasing fishery production to mitigate foreign exchange problems, but also as a means to increase rural employment and income of subsistence and small-scale farmers and fishermen. Several projects (supported for their aim of promoting aquaculture) assumed that the rural farmer would be a producer of food for his own domestic needs, i.e. subsistence. His needs for other goods and services would be met by sale of labour or surplus production. Fish farming thus seemed an attractive alternative to improve the rural standard of living. However, in most countries, rural aquaculture has not become a source of employment and income, or improved nutritional levels. Although most assistance projects (for example, in Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Haiti) initially emphasized development of subsistence aquaculture, they have met with limited success. There have been several problems, not only
related to the structure of the sector as it develops but also to weaknesses in the institutions designed to serve the sector.
In Jamaica tilapia farming is divided into three sub-sectors, namely industrial or commercial farming, small-scale farming, and rural farming. Small-scale and rural farming are usually characterized by the size of the holding; the former ranges from 0.5-5.0 ha and the latter less than 0.5 ha. Small-scale farmers are the most numerous, representing 70% of the total number of farmers, and their grow-out ponds cover more than 25% of the total surface area in farming. Their production, however, is less than 2.0% of the island's total. Small-scale and rural farming has been affected by the inability of the Inland Fisheries Unit to provide fingerlings at subsidized rates. Many such farmers have remained inactive and others abandoned farming altogether.
Recently, as the industry evolved and adapted to its new situation, some small-scale farmers have been able to obtain fingerlings from private producers. Industrial farmers, on the other hand, had advantages in financial resources for the access and purchase of resources, such as seed and feed, equipment and other inputs, and processing, marketing, and distribution. Farms of more than 5.0 ha make up the commercial sector. In 1987 there were 116 farms covering a total surface of 450 ha. Of these farms 10% were subsistence farmers who owned less than 1% of the pond surface area; 70% were small-scale fish farmers in possession of 25% of the pond surface area; and the remaining 75% of the pond area belonged to 24 commercial farms.
The transfer of aquaculture technology and the establishment of commercial tilapia farming as a viable industry has been successful in Jamaica. One government-owned hatchery and several privately owned hatcheries supply fingerlings to producers, especially rural and small-scale farmers. The larger farmers have become self-sufficient. Aquaculture Jamaica Ltd., Aqualapia Jamaica Ltd., C & T MultiFarms, Sunfish Hatcheries Ltd., and Mitchell Town Fish Farm are some of the larger private companies involved in commercial tilapia production. Prawn farming is diminishing in interest as producers are finding it more profitable to raise tilapia than prawns. Marine aquaculture consists only of a little oyster production (12 t in 1985), but there are plans to develop marine shrimp farming.
In Cuba, in spite of the extensive nature of its predominant production through culture-based fisheries, aquaculture is not an artisanal practice but rather a complex industrial activity carried out by the National Aquaculture Enterprise. The Enterprise, created in 1980, is self-financing. In addition to planning and coordination of sectoral functions at the national level it is responsible for production of freshwater fish through stocking, management, and harvesting some 100 000 ha of hydroelectric dams, irrigation reservoirs, and other man-made impoundments. It is also in charge of operating supporting facilities for the sector, such as hatcheries, experimental research stations, post-harvest handling, and storage. Over 3 000 people work for the Enterprise, including administrators, researchers, extension agents, and fishermen (who may be either mid-level technicians or trained on-the-job). Aquaculture fish workers are reported to have higher incomes than agriculture
workers and the overall mean monthly wage is 25% above the national average.
The Ministry of Fisheries has carried out experimental work on P. schmitti, but encountered some problems with growth above 14 g. In 1986 it decided to launch a programme of development of P. vannamei. including the construction of ponds and hatcheries, with the assistance of FAO.
Shrimp farming communities, on the other hand, are relatively marginated and, until now, have not had the same benefits as freshwater counterparts due to their geographical isolation. Shrimp farming is therefore being promoted as a means of producing an export commodity as well as rural coastal development. In addition to constructing shrimp culture facilities, the new Shrimp Farming Administrative Unit is providing these communities with basic public infrastructure, such as roads, communications, health and education centres, and electricity services.
There are reported to be six large companies producing shrimp in Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, and about 15 small companies operating in the Lesser Antilles. In addition there are more than 750 small-scale owner/operators producing shrimp in small ponds of 0.25-3 ha in size.
Antigua Shrimp Ltd. was created in 1984. Six 2 ha ponds were built and water was supplied from a 10 ha reservoir and a pumping station. The company has sold majority interest to East Caribbean Flour Mills Ltd. of St. Vincent, which has made known its intentions to use the facilities as a research and training station (hatchery) to support a large project in Haiti. The production is 6 t/yr. Attempts were made to start freshwater fish cultivation (T. zilli, T. aurea, Ictalurus punctatus), but they failed due to lack of water. A small production of ornamental fish is also reported, as a sideline business, in 20 small ponds on a 1 ha site. Research on king crab (Mithrax spinosissimus) is conducted by the Smithsonian Institute. Research and pilot-scale production of seaweed (Gracilaria) has been initiated by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada.
Bahamas Marine Fish Farms breeds, hatches, grows, and processes the red variety of T. nilotica in heavily stocked tanks using brackish water from wells. Annual production was approximately 36 t in 1986, but was expected to double in 1988. A commercial shrimp culture operation was established on Long Island by Maritek Corporation, but culture activities were dependent on imported larvae. The farm had to suspend operations in 1986 as a result of financial difficulties. A small production of ornamental fish (20 000/y) is also reported. The unit, designed to produce 1.5 million fish per year, with a 300 m^2 hatchery, is managed by Aqualite Research Corporation.
A pilot project for tilapia culture in Barbados has been suspended due to water problems. Some small-scale farmers have ponds with local tilapias, but production is consumed by the producers themselves.
In Bermuda an experimental production unit of dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), supplied with imported fry from a Florida hatchery, is reported to be under operation.
The Government of the Cayman Islands has purchased the former Cayman Turtle Farm, which was engaged in turtle culture until 1984. As the USA regulations banned the importation of sea turtle products, the scale of operation was greatly reduced and a large part of the farm is no longer used for turtle culture. It is now proposed to culture marine shrimps in the farm.
A small Macrobrachium pilot project is carried out in Dominica with the participation of European Development Fund (EDF) and the Organization of American States (OAS), in cooperation with Taiwan, Province of China (PC). There are 6 ponds (0.1-0.12 ha), 8 raceways, a small hatchery, and a small laboratory. The first production yielded about 1.2 t/ha/y in 1986, and was sold directly to restaurants.
A second project, with the assistance of USAID, is attempting to produce the Australian freshwater lobster, Cherax tenusimanus. Facilities include six 0.11 ha ponds, and a small laboratory. The first juveniles were imported from Australia in 1986. No data on the present status of this project are available. Tilapia was also being cultivated on a small-scale, but an extension programme launched in 1978 collapsed in 1982 due to lack of funding.
In Dominican Republic three commercial farms produced 240 t of marine shrimp. Production is expected to increase considerably when all the facilities are completed. Isabel Aquacultura SA produced P. monodon under a closed-cycle system whereby broodstock, originally imported from Australia, are reproduced by artificial induction. In addition to the hatchery the company owns a processing plant with a storage capacity of about 50 t. The other producers are growing P. vannamei. supplied by the Cultura Mar Caribe hatchery. Industrias Pesqueras Marien SA has a concession of 1 000 ha of land and intends to begin operations in the near future. There is also a small commercial farm producing eel (Anguilla rostrata), with elvers collected from the wild in northern river estuaries. There are several other aquaculture ventures for the production of king crab (Mithrax spinosissimus) and mangrove oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae).
In 1987 there were 91 subsistence farmers who produced over 3 t of fish for auto-consumption; 1 314 artisanal fishermen landed about 650 t of fish produced through culture-based fisheries programmes implemented by the Fisheries Resources Department in approximately 10 000 ha of freshwater bodies, and 33 farmers with 84 ha who produced nearly 55 t of prawns supplied by 13 hatcheries located in the central part of the island. No fish are produced by these farmers due to the low price in local markets. At the industrial level there are only three companies that produced 62.5 t of prawns in 1988 in 35 ha, each one with its own hatchery.
There are three experimental projects in Grenada. There is a small pilot project with Macrobrachium at Greenville, with PLs imported from Guadeloupe; an experiment on sea moss (Gracilaria) cultivation with support from the International Centre for Ocean Development of Canada, and a private pilot project on king crab (Mithrax spinosissimus) in Cariacou Island for exports.
Prawn aquaculture in Guadeloupe was initiated in the early 1980s, with Macrobrachium PLs imported from Martinique. In 1987 there were 18 farms with 40 ha of ponds, producing 46 t for the local market. Three hatcheries (of a large cooperative and two small private firms) provide producers with PLs, and the larger one is exporting to Puerto Rico and Grenada. Total production is about 9 million PLs, of which 3.5 millions are exported. Two new projects were to start in 1988, for pilot cultivation of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae) and a shrimp farm, with a second shrimp farm in Marie Galante, which is a dependent island.
Out of 5 200 small subsistence ponds constructed between 1958-77 in Haiti, it appears that only about 500 ponds remain in production in the 1980s. The most recent figures reported by the Service des Pêches et de la Pisciculture indicate 6 t in 1987. A new project funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is trying to restore the Damien Governmental Fish Station, and provide farmers with fry and technical assistance. Experimental culture with cages in reservoirs is also reported. The second phase of the project is to construct a large tilapia hatchery to produce fingerlings to support a national freshwater stocking programme and productive culture-based fishery in 26 000 ha of reservoirs available nation-wide.
In Martinique aquaculture development was initiated in 1978 with the introduction of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. In 1981, a commercial cooperative hatchery was built. The hatchery can produce 10-12 million PLs, but local needs are only 7 million/y. Prawn production in 41 ha of ponds was 54 t in 1987, forecast to increase to 65 t in 1988 in 44 ha. The 51 farms are small, with 39 farms less than 1 ha each, 9 farms with 1-3 ha each, and 3 farms only with more than 3 ha. In 1981 a marine project was launched by a private company to produce 300 t of European sea bass per year in rotating floating cages. The products were to be exported to France. Due to financial and disease problems the largest annual production was only 7 t (in 1986), and the project later collapsed with debts estimated to be US$ 1.2 million.
A new pilot and research project began in 1985 for intensive production of red drum (Sciaenops oscellatus). Fingerlings were imported from USA to be future breeders. Sea bass technology for intensive larvae production was adapted to red drum. The first production of commercial size fish in cages was reported to be successful, both technically and economically.
The Leeward Island Shrimp Company is the only enterprise operating in St. Christopher and Nevis. This farm has an average annual production of 6-7 t from 3 ha of ponds. In St. Lucia the only reported production of significance is tilapia, but there are no precise figures. There are only small ponds/reservoirs (less than 0.1 ha) and a small government-owned research station recently upgraded through funds provided by USAID. In marine waters, culture of seaweed (Gracilaria) began in 1981 with assistance from IDRC. In 1987 there were 8 farms and 200 rafts, but no data on production are available. Production is exported to Trinidad and Barbados.
Macrobrachium and tilapia production is active in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but by non-commercial projects which receive assistance from China. Some extension work has been carried out in rural areas, but production is still minimal.
In Trinidad a Government-owned company (Bamboo Grove Fish Farm) operates a freshwater station which supplies fingerlings of T. mossambica and Hoplosternum littorale (cascadura). In 1985 a total of 15 000 fingerlings were distributed to 366 small-scale fish farmers and, although there are no figures on production, the farms are reported to be successful. A government agency, Caroni Ltd., is planning to construct a large farm for production of 300 t of tilapia. Another company, Montero, assisted by Agricultural Concepts, of USA, implemented a 2 ha pilot project for penaeid shrimp culture in 1987. An extension to 20 ha is now planned.
In Turks and Caicos Islands the Caicos Conch Farm is producing juveniles of Strombus gigas (150 000 2-7 mm, and 35 000 10-20 mm conch in 1987) for research, restocking, or culture. Exports have been made to various Caribbean countries. West Indies Mariculture Ltd. is starting operations for culture of king crab (Mithrax spinosissimus).
A small hatchery and grow-out ponds were constructed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands by Maritek Corporation, but the company encountered serious problems in operating the hatchery, and ceased operations in 1985. During the late 1970s some experimental work was carried out on the use of artificial upwelling for oysters, clams, and scallops.
2.5 Organizations of producers
In Cuba aquaculture production is an integrated operation under the auspices of a state-owned company, the National Aquaculture Enterprise. Its members are fishermen, technicians (aquaculturists), researchers, and administrators who work together and collaborate in strengthening the sector. For the purpose of harvesting the culture-based fisheries, fishermen organize themselves into groups of six, each having at their disposal a small towing vessel with inboard motor, three small craft with outboard motors, and 18 gill nets (120 m long).
In Jamaica tilapia markets have become highly competitive and merchants and higglers tend to abuse the producers. Consequently farmers have formed the Jamaican Fish Farmers' Association. Its steering committee has procured institutional support and other benefits from the Jamaica Agricultural Society, the National Union of Cooperative Societies, and from the Inland Fisheries Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. Similarly, in the Dominican Republic inland fishermen are grouped in cooperatives and other types of associations which provide them with benefits, particularly protection of the sales value of their products from abuses by intermediary agents or merchants.
Producers of freshwater prawns have formed an Aquaculture Committee within the Agro-industrial Joint Investment Association of the Dominican Republic. This Committee acts as a forum for discussion of technological and economical issues afflicting the industry. In Dominica a cooperative of farmers has been formed to operate prawn ponds under the sponsorship of a multilateral assistance project; and in Haiti producers recently formed the Association of Aquaculturists of Haiti, with 28 members.
In St. Lucia sea moss culturists have formed a cooperative to help organize the industry for local and regional markets, and to standardize and maintain product quality. A "koudmen" system of assistance is already in place, whereby all farmers meet once a month on a farm and work to produce new rafts or assist in other ways required.
2.6 Financial investment by public and private enterprises
Present aquaculture production in the Caribbean is the result of considerable public and private investment in the sector.
Public investment is provided in a number of ways. In particular there are (i) quasi-commercial loan assistance schemes, (ii) grants and subsidies, and (iii) indirect support through administration, extension, research, education, and training. The public sector continues to fund national infrastructure, such as production facilities (hatcheries), experimental fish stations, and research and training centres, all of which lead to increased production for local markets, particularly through subsistence aquaculture and culture-based fisheries.
The private sector generally invests most of its capital in production of cash crops (export products), mainly in marine shrimps and shellfish, but also in tilapia (in Jamaica and the Bahamas) and freshwater prawns (French Antilles and the Dominican Republic).
With the exception of Cuba the bulk of investment in the sector is made by private enterprises. In Dominican Republic, Trinidad, St. Christopher, Antigua, Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and US Virgin Islands, much of the investment has been provided by corporations from the USA. In Dominican Republic the largest shrimp farm in the region is financed totally by investors from Taiwan PC. In Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad, and French Antilles investment in small-scale aquaculture enterprises is derived from the agriculture sector, as diversification of farmers' activities.
Antigua Shrimp Ltd., Aqualife Research Corporation (Bahamas), Worldwide Protein (Bahamas) Ltd., Morton Bahamas Ltd., Traverse Group Inc. (Dominica), Isabel Aquacultura SA (Dominican Republic), South Caribbean Group (Dominican Republic), the Leeward Island Shrimp Company (St. Christopher), the West Indies Mariculture Ltd., and France-Aquaculture (French Antilles) are the main foreign-capital enterprises which have invested in the sector in the Caribbean region as described. Financial aid from the French government is also important throughout the French Antilles, with approximately 40% of the total investment. Most of the operators in the Lesser Antilles receive financial assistance from their governments, or have received bilateral, multilateral, and even non-governmental organization (NGO) assistance.
In Jamaica Agro-21 Corporation Ltd., a statutory body jointly funded by the Government of Jamaica and USAID, had as its primary objective the restructuring of the country's agriculture. In its role of catalysing and facilitating private sector investment in aquaculture, it undertook not only the development of infrastructure (irrigation, reservoirs, wells, and distribution networks) but also constructed 125 ha of fish ponds on government lands for lease to potential fish farmers.
The Jamaica Agricultural Development Foundation, a non-profit financial foundation, provides venture capital for commercially viable projects ranging from US$ 9 000-182 000. It also exercises monetary flexibility in various ways as required for high-risk projects, such as acceptance of a wide range of securities as collateral, moratoriums and grace periods on repayments of both interest and capital, and through interest rate policies based on average rates. The Foundation invested in Sunfish Hatcheries for the production of tilapia fingerlings which then played a pivotal role for the sector by providing seedstock for grow-out farms. The farm has 7.5 ha of ponds with the capacity of producing 4-5 million fingerlings annually. It contributed 42% of the US$ 270 000 total investment.
Public investment in aquaculture has also been made by the Government of Jamaica in Aqualapia Jamaica Limited. This is a parastatal enterprise, and at one time the largest producer of tilapia in the country.
Public investment in the aquaculture sector in Cuba during the period 1982-85 amounted to Cu.Ps. 23.8 million for inland culture-based fisheries, and Cu.Ps. 9 million for shrimp culture. Of these, Cu.Ps. 14 million were invested in fish hatcheries and Cu.Ps. 7 million in fish products reception centres for post-harvest handling. In 1986 public investment in aquaculture reached Cu.Ps. 15.3 million which is equivalent to 40% of the total investment for the fisheries sector.
In the Dominican Republic public investment in the aquaculture sector is of the order of US$ 26 000 per annum, while much more substantial investment funds have come from abroad (see 2.8 and 4.8).
The High Impact Agricultural Marketing and Production Program is a unique source of equity capital for private sector firms and organizations. The sponsor, USAID, has made US$ 1 million available in non-traditional export oriented agriculture, agroprocessing, fishing, and other related business and is seeking joint venture investment opportunities in the English-speaking eastern Caribbean.
2.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
International assistance started to flow into the region more than a decade ago at a time when it was believed that subsistence aquaculture could make a significant contribution to rural development. This assistance was initially provided in terms of research and development of fish culture technologies, which included biological and ecological studies, pond construction, artificial reproduction, seedstock production, feeding and nutrition studies, etc., in addition to training human resources. Most assistance projects were oriented toward the culture of freshwater fishes, then attention was focused on the freshwater prawn and later to marine culture of molluscs. It is only recently that marine shrimp attracted the attention of both international assistance agencies and foreign investors. In brief, foreign assistance has influenced the development of aquaculture within the region in terms of selection of species, training of human resources, and provision of infrastructure
and equipment.
In several countries FAO introduced fish farming into the region by promoting stocking of inland bodies of water with tilapia and carps. Fish hatcheries were built at the time.
USAID played an important role in the transfer of aquaculture technology and establishing commercial tilapia farming as a viable industry in Jamaica through implementation of two inland fisheries and fish production projects with a total duration of five years (1979-83). This brought a typical form of integration between adapted aquaculture and local agricultural practices which determined the economy, production methods, social involvement, and consumer preferences; in short, every facet of the present day aquaculture industry of Jamaica. Later, in 1987, FAO provided assistance through its Technical Cooperation Programme to strengthen the Inland Fisheries Unit's training capabilities to fulfil national and regional needs, and to implement a national programme of assistance to fish farmers in the fields of financial planning and farm management.
In 1954 in the Dominican Republic USAID introduced several species, such as channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), black bass (Micropterus salmoides), Leopmis auritus, and Rana catesbiana. Assistance was interrupted until the 1970s when IDRC, USAID, and the Social Service of the Dominican Churches relaunched subsistence and semi-commercial fish farming. The Chinese Technical Agricultural Mission contributed to the promotion of freshwater prawn culture. During the present decade further assistance has been received from the OAS, FAO, USAID, the American Soybean Association, and Taiwan (PC).
Financial assistance for the implementation of some of these projects on the part of the national government was provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). However, the lack of trained personnel impeded the successful completion of the projects and further assistance in terms of manpower training was required.
In Cuba technical assistance has been provided by UNDP/FAO, the Soviet Union, Korea, and China, although in most cases it has been oriented more toward research (see 4.7) than toward direct strengthening of the sector.
Other international agencies have provided technical assistance to countries of the region. UNDP/FAO have implemented a number of projects in nearly all countries, generally oriented toward the development of rural fish farming. Their main achievement was strengthening governments' capabilities to produce seedstock for stocking of ponds, and to conduct extension, training, and research programmes. Specialists and highly qualified experts were recruited as technical advisors to these projects, assisted by Regional Fisheries Officers. Antigua, the Bahamas, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrrat, and St. Lucia received assistance from UNDP/FAO through ADCP in assessing their respective potentials for aquaculture development.
Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance is currently flowing into the region, but at a reduced pace. USAID supports projects in Dominica in rural fish farming. This country has also received assistance from the EDF for a prawn culture pilot project, and the Traverse Group Inc. with USAID funding has launched a pilot project for cultivation of the Australian freshwater lobster or marron (Cherax tenuimanus).
Bilateral technical assistance is being provided by Taiwan PC for the production of freshwater prawns in Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent.
Grenada has received technical assistance from OAS to carry out a pilot project for the cultivation of prawns. Assistance has also been provided by the International Centre for Ocean Development for the introduction of sea moss cultivation. FAO has recently funded an aquaculture feasibility study which will serve as the basis for the future development of the sector.
The Inland Resource Foundation of St. Thomas, with USAID funding, has undertaken a feasibility study for cultivating brine shrimp (Artemia) in St. Christopher, among other eastern Caribbean countries. The South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium is also providing technical assistance to promote aquaculture development in St. Christopher.
Tilapia farming is being promoted in St. Lucia with technical assistance provided by USAID. This project is complemented by another supported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to integrate production of pigs with tilapia farming. Prawn farming, in turn, is receiving technical assistance from Taiwan PC. IDRC, in conjunction with the East Caribbean National Areas Management Programme (ECNAMP), has launched a successful pilot project for the cultivation of sea moss by low-income workers or by the unemployed. Training provided for Grenada staff and on-site assistance has been the basis for extending this technology to the rest of the region, with the eventual aim of establishing an industry in the Caribbean.
The Government of Italy, through AQUILA, provides assistance at a regional level. Cuba and the Dominican Republic have benefited from such assistance.
A programming meeting on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries in Aquaculture for Latin America and the Caribbean, sponsored by UNDP in collaboration with Sistema Económico Latino Americano (SELA) and Organizacion Latinoamericana de Desarrollo Pesquero (OLDEPESCA), has recently been held (June 1989). Through this event, 4 priority areas of horizontal cooperation in aquaculture among 19 countries have been established. These are training, technical assistance and exchange of experts, exchange of aquatic organisms, and joint projects. In this meeting 9 training courses, 52 technical assistance activities, 27 agreements on the exchange of species, and 11 joint projects of regional interest, respectively, were negotiated by the authorized representatives of all participating countries. An agreement was reached to request formal financial assistance from bilateral and international donor agencies. In addition to the IDB, institutions and governments of Cameroon,
Canada, China, Hungary, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia indicated their interest and willingness to cooperate with the region according to their own capabilities.
Through a contract with UNDP/FAO, France-Aquaculture is providing full technical assistance for construction and initial operational guidance for marine shrimp farming in Cuba. Also FAO, through Technical Cooperation Programmes, has conducted feasibility studies in Grenada and Dominica.
A number of engineering and aquaculture companies from the USA are also providing technical assistance, and some have established offices or subsidiaries in the region; for example, Aquacorp in Puerto Rico, and Aquacultural Concepts in the US Virgin Islands. France-Aquaculture is the only European company which works permanently in the region and supports projects in Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Cuba.
2.8 Capital assistance to the sub-sector
The main capital assistance for development of aquaculture in the region is currently associated with activities described in section 2.7. These are predominantly funds from multilateral and bilateral agencies as components of a larger project.
Total financial obligations from USAID to Jamaica for a five-year project were approximately US$ 9 million, 54% of which was contributed by the Government and the remainder financed through loan and grant agreements. A large proportion of this was in the form of capital assistance for the construction of three fish hatcheries and research stations. USAID also financed the construction of an experimental station in Dominica, and hatchery and laboratory facilities for tilapia culture in St. Lucia and in Barbados.
IDRC funded construction of several demonstration farms for the culture of sea moss in St. Lucia, and the International Centre for Ocean Development financed similar facilities in Grenada.
The construction of a shrimp hatchery and farm in Cuba is being funded by UNDP, executed by FAO, and sub-contracted through France-Aquaculture. This project, approximately US$ 1 million, is a component of a comprehensive development project of US$ 10 million.
UNDP is also financing the construction of a tilapia hatchery and the upgrading of other state-owned aquaculture facilities in Haiti.
Development grants of the French Government and the EEC have been provided for the construction of prawn farms (US$ 1.2 million) and hatcheries (US$ 0.5 million) in the French Antilles.

3.1 Extension services in the region
Extension services for aquaculture (as well as fisheries) are limited throughout the Caribbean region. There are few services available in the Greater Antilles and French Antilles, and these have been introduced only recently.
In Jamaica the Inland Fisheries Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture is the agency responsible for providing extension services to fish farmers throughout the island. The programme was initiated concurrently with the USAID Fish Production System Development Project. Extension staff include the majority of technical personnel assigned to the Unit, and there is an Extension Branch Chief, two Regional Extension Officers, several Extension Officers, and two pond construction specialists.
Despite the fact that a significant amount of effort was expended to provide extension services and training to subsistence and small-scale farmers, these services gradually drifted toward the larger corporate farmers. This was probably due to Government's emphasis on increasing production and the pressure for services from the corporate farmers, and possibly the extension personnel's involuntary attraction to larger and more ambitious projects.
In Jamaica representatives of feed manufacturing companies, in addition to their responsibilities for sales, are also aquaculture extension officers with a genuine interest in development of the industry. They act as professional agents by assisting farmers with nutrition and feeding problems, and in other ways, which is particularly important at a time when the Government's extension service is confronting serious weaknesses.
In Cuba the National Aquaculture Enterprise is responsible within its internal organization for its own extension services. Qualified fishermen and aquaculture workers receive short courses and on-the-job training annually from mid-level technicians and professionals who, in turn, receive periodic training at their corresponding level.
In Haiti extension for rural and subsistence fish farming is an important component of the UNDP/FAO aquaculture project under implementation. Its orientation is gradually being shifted toward inland fishermen in accordance with the priority now being given to culture-based fisheries. Training of extension personnel is also envisaged in the second phase of the project.
In the Dominican Republic in 1984 the National Agro-aquaculture Programme initiated an extension service which became vital for the expansion of the sector. Presently extension for subsistence farmers is provided by the Social Service of the Dominican Church, and for commercial farmers by a private consulting company.
In the French Antilles extension services are an integral part of the organization of the producers' cooperatives, assisted by expert staff of the Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) from France.
Due to the undeveloped state of aquaculture, and the fact that private ventures do not depend on them, the scope of extension services in the small island states, for example, the Bahamas, Barbados, and St. Christopher and Nevis, is limited.
In Trinidad and Tobago an extension programme was developed which provides services for project feasibility, site evaluation, pond construction, and harvesting and marketing. In response to numerous requests made to the Farmers' Training Unit, a training course was organized in 1984 by the Aquaculture Sub-Unit of the Fisheries Division in collaboration with the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Agricultural Engineering Division of the Ministry, and FAO. This course is now offered annually (see 3.2). The Aquaculture Sub-Unit also has, as an ongoing feature, one-day seminars. Specific targets for the country, such as the numbers of farmers to be trained, the number of trained extension agents, and projected growth of the sector, remain to be identified.
Throughout the region US Peace Corps Volunteers are involved in aquaculture extension in coordination with projects supported by USAID.
3.2 Training of extension agents
Training in extension methodology in the countries of the region is not a formal or widespread practice, mostly because governments do not always recognize that an extension service represents an important mechanism whereby innovations or new systems can be introduced at the national or regional level. Most extension agents, however, have some formal technical schooling in fisheries and/or aquaculture, as well as some practical experience acquired in fish culture stations.
As government salaries are usually low, candidates for training and employment as extension workers are not highly motivated individuals. This fact not only reduces the efficiency of training courses, but also reflects in the efficiency and effectiveness of personnel employed once training is terminated. It is expected that this situation will change as the aquaculture sector develops within each country. Ideally, government staff should be given the opportunity to receive a background education in aquaculture as a start to any strategy for national sectoral development.
Most countries generally lack personnel properly trained in extension methods. There are few training institutions which offer specialized courses on extension or which provide follow-up and/or refresher/recycling courses. None the less, qualified personnel for the dissemination and extension of aquaculture are gradually becoming available, partly as a result of the implementation of external technical assistance projects in the sub-sector (see 3.9). Unfortunately, not all national development plans have recognized the importance of creating a well-structured extension service as a branch of the government institution responsible for administration of the sector. The feedback derived from this extension service would also help to improve the work of research and training, and address the needs of producers in a more coherent manner in planning and overall development.
Extension training in Cuba is a function of the National Aquaculture Enterprise. As all aquaculture activities are integrated into this single entity, research and development establish close links between extension and production due to their direct and indirect involvement in almost all aspects of the sector. This interaction contributes to a fast and thorough extension of new techniques and practices which are developed, which make a large extension service unnecessary.
In Jamaica training on extension methodology is only partially covered in the various general aquaculture courses offered by the University of the West Indies, the Jamaica College of Agriculture, and informally at the Inland Fisheries Unit. The Ministry of Agriculture has a training division for extension but it has not established a link with the Inland Fisheries Unit to assist in the creation of an efficient extension training system like it has for agriculture.
Trinidad and Tobago holds an annual 5-day course for extension agents organized by the Aquaculture Unit of the Fisheries Division in collaboration with the Institute of Marine Affairs, FAO, and the Agricultural Engineering Division of the Ministry. In the French Antilles special training courses are organized in Martinique by the Aquaculture Development Association.
3.3 Seed production facilities in the region
The low production of juveniles of both freshwater and marine organisms remains one of the major bottlenecks for the growth of aquaculture in most countries of the Caribbean. Therefore modern hatchery technology for the large number and variety of fish and crustaceans, presently being cultured has had to be imported and/or adapted to local conditions.
Freshwater fish hatcheries, mostly still operating on a pilot scale in the region, are owned and operated by the public sector. Many are operated in conjunction with technical assistance projects promoting fish farming for increased food production or rural development. Extension in aquaculture, as practised in the region, is based mainly on propagation of seed for these producers. Therefore, most institutions which include extension among their tasks, concentrate also on hatchery technologies. Consequently, government hatcheries, in many cases, have become focal points for their extension programmes. This has also been the strategy of technical assistance projects which are attempting to introduce aquaculture into the region.
The development of private hatcheries is critical to the region's shrimp culture industry, as the native species of shrimp are not the most suitable species for culture. For example, Antigua Shrimp Ltd., (now East Caribbean Maricultures Ltd.), although inactive at present, is being transformed into a shrimp hatchery to supply PLs for grow-out in a farm in Haiti.
The Bahamas Marine Farms Ltd. is a commercial facility for intensive production of tilapia. Seed production techniques used in the hatchery are based on the incubation of eggs stripped from broodstock. The fry are then sex-reversed by hormone treatment. Ozone is used for aerating the water. The hatchery has the capacity to supply about 1 million fingerlings for the annual production of 160 t of fish. No commercial sale of fry is contemplated. The Bahamas Mariculture Research Institute has its own hatchery for the production of tilapia fingerlings used for grow-out in sea cages in the canals of Freeport, Grand Bahama. The Caribbean Marine Research Centre at Lee Stocking Island has a hatchery with a capacity of 20 000 fingerlings of tilapia per week which are grown in seawater ponds.
In Barbados tilapia is produced at a subsistence level only, as there are no state-operated or commercial hatcheries.
In the Cayman Islands the Cayman Turtle Farm was engaged in turtle culture until 1984. Turtle eggs were incubated under controlled conditions until hatching. The availability of eggs was not a constraint for the production of the farm.
Inland aquaculture in Cuba is based on the production of fingerlings of tilapia and carps for restocking dams and reservoirs. The National Aquaculture Enterprise operates twelve hatcheries spread throughout the country. In 1987 total production of fingerlings was 17.5 million tilapia, and 8.9 million cyprinids. These hatcheries are operated by biologists and technicians trained in fish reproduction and hatchery technology. Tilapia breeders spawn in earthen ponds, and fingerlings are reared until they reach a size of 10 g when they are ready for stocking. Propagation of cyprinid fingerlings is carried out by induced spawning.
In 1987 the first shrimp hatchery operated in the region, and two more are under construction. One is being built by France-Aquaculture in Cuba as part of a UNDP/FAO project.
The Dominican Republic has 16 hatcheries for freshwater prawns and 3 for marine shrimp. Isabel Aquacultura at its Montecristi facility produces Penaeus monodon and P. schmitti, and Cultura Mar Caribe produces P. vannamei and P. stylirostris, mostly for export. Camardom has a capacity to produce one million PLs of Macrobrachium rosenbergii per month. The country is probably the leader in crustacean culture in the Caribbean region.
In Guadeloupe a pilot hatchery was built with assistance from France-Aquaculture. A larger unit, called SICA Aquaculture, was completed in 1985, with an annual capacity of 15 million PLs of M. rosenbergii. Part of the production is intended for export to other Caribbean countries. Two smaller hatcheries have been built since then. SICA anticipates that prawn farmers will eventually expand into marine shrimp, and plans to service that market as well.
In Haiti a small commercial prawn hatchery is under operation adjacent to a tilapia-prawn polyculture farm. Its results have attracted attention of other local potential investors. Several foreign companies are considering setting up shrimp farms and hatcheries on the North Eastern coast at Grande Saline. A state-operated experimental station at Damien is presently producing tilapia fingerlings for distribution to subsistence farmers, and a larger hatchery to produce seed for stocking inland lakes and reservoirs is envisaged under the second phase of the UNDP/FAO project.
Seed production facilities in Jamaica are mainly concentrated in the hands of the private sector. Tilapia propagation practices presently used incorporate reproduction, breeding, and nursery stages as an integral part of production, and most commercial farmers are self-reliant. However, the small-scale and subsistence farmers cannot afford to spare scarce surface area for breeding ponds, thus sacrificing production of food fish. The divestment and closure of state-operated hatcheries adversely affected the industry, though at the same time created an opportunity for private sector involvement in the commercial production of fingerlings. Several farms are already supplying all-male fingerlings. Freshwater prawn farming, on the other hand, is not competitive and presently all prawn hatcheries have ceased to operate.
The Martinique Regional Council began a freshwater prawn project in 1976 and later received assistance from IFREMER. The hatchery is presently operated by a cooperative and produces about 9 million PLs annually. This supplies more than 40 ha of production ponds from which 50 t of prawns are harvested annually.
In St Christopher and Nevis the Leeward Islands Shrimp Co. has a hatchery for the production of P. vannamei PLs. As its production exceeds internal demand, the company exports PLs to other countries of the region.
In St. Lucia the Government manages a small fish culture unit at the Union Agricultural Experiment Station to supply fingerlings to subsistence farmers. Further assistance is being provided by ECLAC to upgrade the facilities and services provided. A hatchery for the production of prawns is currently under construction with the assistance of Taiwan PC.
St. Vincent is also assisted by Taiwan PC in the construction of a prawn hatchery which will supply PLs to an experimental farm.
In Trinidad and Tobago the Government owns and operates the Bamboo Grove Fish Farm which maintains broodstock and supplies fingerlings of tilapia and cascadura (Hoplosternum littorale). A number of experimental projects have small production hatcheries for prawn, shrimp, and fish.
In Turks and Caicos the Trade Winds Industries, Inc. constructed and started operating the first commercial queen conch hatchery. The company exports part of its production to Haiti and Martinique.
3.4 Manufacturers of feed and fertilizers in the region
In the Dominican Republic the quality of available feeds has not been reliable. One shrimp producer is building a feed factory to meet his own needs, and the surplus will be sold locally and regionally. Isabel Aquacultura is importing feed from Taiwan PC.
Although until now its demand for formulated feeds has been minimal Cuba is planning to manufacture them. The new Programme for the Development of Shrimp Culture contemplates investment in feed manufacturing plants.
Jamaica, like most other countries of the region, is not self-sufficient in the production of feeds and fertilizers. All grain crops used as ingredients are imported. Two major animal feed manufacturers, Master Blend and Jamaica Feeds (a subsidiary of Ralston Purina Inc., of USA), and a third small company called Jet Pet, produce fish feeds. Each compete on different economic and commercial grounds and on different scales of operation, catering for specific segments of the aquaculture industry. This competition has spurred technical improvements in diet formulation. In 1986, about 3 000 t of fish feed were consumed by the industry, equivalent to about 1.7% of the total animal feed produced in the country. This proportion is expected to increase to about 5% by 1990. Although availability may not become a constraint for future growth, price variations will affect the operational economics of the farms and will be reflected in the final price of the product. Feed costs for
tilapia amount to approximately 50% of total production costs.
In most of the Lesser Antilles and in Haiti there are private or cooperative animal feed factories but to-date none of them has yet produced fish feeds. A notable exception is the French Antilles where specially formulated diets are produced for their prawn culture industry.
It is estimated that fertilizers required for aquaculture amount to less than 1% of the total used by the agricultural sector. Because the general policy in most countries is to modernize aquaculture and increase production and productivity through the provision of infrastructure and support services, it is not anticipated that fertilizers will become a scarce commodity for aquaculture development. On the other hand, the use of organic fertilizers (manures and other agricultural wastes) is being encouraged through the promotion of aquaculture integrated with agriculture practices of animal and crop husbandry.
Finally, it should be added that fish feeds, and to a lesser extent shrimp feeds, have a proportionately smaller impact on foreign currency expenditure than other formulated animal feeds. Although some of the ingredients used in manufacturing fish feeds are imported, their proportion has decreased over the years with the increase in use of local by-products.
3.5 Manufacturers of equipment
Equipment for construction has been in ever increasing demand as pond farming practices have developed in Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, and Martinique. Installations for pond-based aquaculture typically include ponds, dams, and dikes, water supply and drainage canals or pipes, monks and pipe sluices, spillways and other fish control structures, such as screens, and in many cases complete pumping stations. Standard equipment and materials used in the construction industry, such as bulldozers, pay loaders, excavators, graders, scrapers and dredgers, are used for most installations. Depending on comparative costs, this equipment may either be hired or acquired locally.
Non-specialized standard materials, such as pipes and fittings, valves, pumps and other hydraulic equipment, are manufactured in the larger countries of the region. The smaller countries, however, have to import these items at considerable expense.
Ordinary equipment and materials, such as mechanical pumps, generators, netting, containers, and floats, which are also used for other purposes or in other industries, like agriculture and irrigation, and fishing, are also generally available within the region. However, specialized equipment normally used in more intensive aquaculture facilities, such as floating cages, tanks, raceways and flow-through systems, water-recirculating systems, and in hatcheries and laboratories, is not manufactured within the region and has to be imported from North America, Europe, or the Far East. This equipment may also include aerators, blowers, small pumps, filters, sterilizers, mechanical feeders and harvesters, graders, incubators, tanks, and most of the equipment used for the manufacture of formulated feeds.
The aquaculture sector of the region also relies heavily on the importation of special scientific equipment, laboratory instruments and chemicals used in hatcheries and in laboratories, such as microscopes, water quality test kits, autoanalyzers, salinometers, oxygen and pH meters, and spectrophotometers, as well as chemical substances, disinfectants, veterinary medicines, and hormones.
3.6 Other services for the industry
There are a number of aquaculture consulting companies in the region which provide services for feasibility studies, or advise on site selection and facility design. Such companies exist in the US Virgin Islands, French Antilles, Dominican Republic, and also Puerto Rico. Some of these companies are subsidiaries of USA or European companies.
There are many architect and engineering consulting companies in the islands which also provide design and construction management services, and water quality analysts who provide services for aquaculture. However, other vital services for the industry, such as marketing, and disease prevention and control, are less adequately covered. Consultants for disease diagnosis are available from Jamaica, at the University of the West Indies, Cuba, through Empresa Nacional de Acuicultura, and in Martinique, through IFREMER.
Non-technical subject matters of aquaculture, such as extension methodology, sector planning, farm management, project formulation and evaluation, marketing, and legislation, are not included in courses offered by universities. This is reflected by the lack of local services and experts in all these areas important for the development of the sector. These more specialized services are supplied by foreign experts from North America, Europe, or the Near and Far East.
3.7 Local credit programmes
Funds for agriculture and rural development, which include a line of credit, have been made available by organizations such as IDB, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), EEC/EDF, CARICOM, OAS, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
In the case of major development loans from the international banks, some projects have included a component of technical assistance for aquaculture development. This has been in the form of capital grants to national financial institutions for lines of credit, or through national projects themselves which manage a credit component. For example, the IDB loan for Integrated Rural Development in the Dominican Republic had a component of US$ 280 000 for promotion and credit programmes.
IFAD has offered long-term concessionary loans for development in association with other assistance to Dominica and Dominican Republic.
In Jamaica the Agricultural Credit Bank has a major role in economic development and on-lends funds through participating intermediaries to the agricultural sector. In the case of aquaculture, these intermediaries are commercial banks, merchant banks, and the People's Cooperative Banks. Disbursement of funds for aquaculture through the latter, such as cooperatives whose membership consists of community residents, has mainly benefited small-scale individual farmers. The loans also provide credit in kind, such as fertilizer, feed, and fish handling equipment. However, this credit programme is not suited to corporate investment and therefore has had limited success in expanding this segment of the sector. For corporate investors, the National Commercial Bank is virtually the sole lender of Agricultural Credit Bank funds. The National Commercial Bank has an aquaculture loan officer in charge of requests for the sector. Loans have a preferential interest rate set at 15% per
annum, a pay-back period of between 5 and 10 years depending on the magnitude of the loan, and an equity collateral requirement of 20%. This compares with non-preferential commercial loans with 25-28% interest rates.
Throughout the region it appears that adequate credit has been available for potential investors in the aquaculture industry. However, some issues remain to be solved, such as the lack of financial experts trained in aquaculture among staff of lending agencies, delays in loan approvals and disbursements which deter potential investors, low credit ceilings in relation to the high capital requirements, land tenure and/or ownership as collateral for eligibility (especially in the case of the small-scale farmers), and delinquency in loan repayments. Although most agricultural banks in the region have credit facilities for farmers in general, their minimum loans are either too high for small-scale and subsistence farmers, or they are unable to meet normal collateral requirements.
Corporate investors and large-scale operators, on the other hand, take advantage of concessionary loans. They also capitalize on government subsidies to both aquaculture and fisheries sectors, and obtain equipment and raw materials, feeds, banking services, tax deductions, and insurance.
3.8 Trade publications for producers
There are few specific trade publications produced in the region for individuals and the industry in general. As the sector expands it is anticipated that more trade publications will appear.
In Cuba the "Boletin Técnico de Acuicultura" is a review of technical advances, mainly achieved by the National Aquaculture Enterprise. "Mar y Pesca" is a trade journal for the fisheries sector which contains a number of articles on national and international aquaculture developments.
In Jamaica the "Jamaican Fish Farmer" is a publication which contains both technical and commercial information on the state of aquaculture in the country. "Feed Time" is a two-monthly newspaper supplement published by Master Blend Feeds Ltd., with news on livestock feed management and regular entries on the latest aquaculture developments.
More regional and scientific in nature are the newsletters of the Asociación Latinoamericana de Acuicultura (ALA), to which both Cuba and Dominican Republic belong, and "Revista Latinoamericana de Acuicultura", published by OLDEPESCA. "Aquarius" is an information bulletin on the activities of OLDEPESCA to which the Dominican Republic is affiliated. The Aquaculture Technical Cooperation Network of the FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean publishes a Newsletter informing its member countries on the achievements of its activities as well as more general information on FAO's regional and national projects.
The region has immediate access to a large range of North American and European publications for the trade through individual subscription. These include such publications as "Aquaculture Magazine" and its annual Buyer's Guide, "World Shrimp Farming", a two-monthly report covering shrimp and prawn farming, "Mollusk Farming, USA", for farming of clams, abalone, scallops, mussels and oysters, the "Water Fanning Journal", and "Salmon Farming", all published in the USA. From Canada there is the "Aquaculture Association of Canada Bulletin", a quarterly with heavy emphasis on the science of salmon farming, and "Canadian Aquaculture", a two-monthly trade journal with extensive coverage of marine culture. From UK there is "Fish Farming International" and "Fish Farmer", and from Belgium "The Artemia Reference Center Newsletter" containing news and abstracts of research conducted on Artemia and its use in aquaculture. Finally the World Aquaculture Society (WAS) publishes "World
Aquaculture", its quarterly magazine.
3.9 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
Technical assistance for local infrastructure has played an important role in the development of the sector in the Caribbean.
OAS provided technical assistance to Dominica for training and the purchase of equipment as part of a project for construction of a small demonstration farm to culture freshwater prawns, funded by EDF.
The Dominican Republic received over US$ 1 million for both technical and capital assistance, provided mainly by USAID, Taiwan PC, and the IDB. The main beneficiaries were the Department of Fishery Resources and other research and NGOs involved in the sector.
The Government of Jamaica has been the recipient of technical assistance from USAID for development of inland aquaculture. Total financial obligations for the five year project were approximately US$ 9 million. The assistance included support for an extension service and technical training service, together with capital assistance for expansion of research facilities and construction of two fish hatcheries.
UNDP, together with FAO, have provided considerable technical assistance through regional and national projects, mostly for technical training in the operation of government-owned hatcheries and fish culture stations. In Haiti assistance focused on extension services to promote subsistence aquaculture, and recently on culture-based fisheries in inland waters. In Cuba assistance has been toward development of an intensive shrimp farming industry.
Technical assistance provided by Taiwan PC has had a considerable influence on the development of prawn culture in the region, while that of IDRC has been oriented toward developing an artisanal industry for sea moss production in Eastern Caribbean countries.

4.1 Manpower training in aquaculture technologies
With some exceptions the educational level of the Caribbean peoples is relatively high. School enrollment for primary and secondary schools is on average above 80%. This compares favourably with averages for Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In the overall strategy for aquaculture development, educated and trained technicians at the intermediate level are considered to be the basic building components of the sector, eventually to become leading administrative and research personnel in government or private institutions, staff of the national extension services, and technical personnel in the private sector.
The high capital outlay and recurrent costs of training institutions, the limited size of individual countries of the region, and difficulties in obtaining adequately trained teaching staff, are factors which constrain national training and favour regional and sub-regional training.
The capability of Jamaica in providing aquaculture training is important in the region. Technical training is offered at all levels, with special technical courses at universities, general mid-level technician training, and farmer training. The Zoology Department at the University of the West Indies offers the high level training for the region. The Inland Fisheries Unit offers formal and informal technician training. The Jamaica College of Agriculture also operates at mid-level, and receives external students from other English-speaking Caribbean countries. Students are given a brief course in aquaculture during their final year of studies. Some organizations, both private and public, offer informal training with sporadic courses for extensionists, technicians, and farmers (classroom sessions, field demonstrations, and supervised technology transfer on farms).
The Caribbean Fisheries Training Development Institute was originally established as a regional institution by the Governments of Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago in 1975. Following the withdrawal of Barbados and Guyana it ceased to function as a regional entity. It was reactivated by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to satisfy its training needs with respect to the 1980-89 Fisheries Development Programme. Despite its capabilities, training in aquaculture is not carried out.
A joint proposal by FAO/ADCP, and CARICOM in 1982 recommended the formation of a Caribbean Regional Aquaculture Centre. Given the present economic situation in the region and the reluctance of CARICOM members to establish any new regional institutions, the centre may never be accomplished. It has therefore been suggested that a consortium of existing training and research institutions in the region, using a modular approach, institutionalize training needs for aquaculture. No decision has yet been made.
In Cuba training in aquaculture is undertaken at three levels, for qualified labourers, middle-level technicians, and upper-level technicians. Qualified labourers are trained through short formal and informal courses on subjects directly relevant to their functions as fishermen, fish handlers, and hatchery workers. Middle-level technicians attend the Andrés Gonzalez Lines Institute of the Fishing Industry Ministry. A two-year programme is given which includes a theoretical course, a field training session, and the preparation of a research thesis under professional guidance. Eighty-four foreign technicians, some from the region, have graduated from the Institute. Upper-level technicians are biologists, agronomists, and veterinarians who receive specialized training in aquaculture, either in-country or abroad, and in some instances candidates follow post-graduate degrees.
In Dominican Republic training in aquaculture is well established. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Experimental Station of the University of Santo Domingo has trained 10 graduates in aquaculture, and 15 technicians. The Universidad Central del Este has built an Aquaculture Research Centre which provides training for middle-level technicians. 80% of the 60 technicians who have been trained are presently employed by aquaculture producers. The National University has inaugurated an Aquaculture School which will offer a specialized career in aquaculture.
Post-graduate courses in aquaculture-related disciplines are offered at the Université des Antilles et de la Guyane in Guadeloupe. Mid-level four month training courses are offered regularly in Martinique by the Aquaculture Association with financial support of the Regional Government and EEC.
For most post-graduate studies in aquaculture, or in relevant applications such as genetics, pathology, zoology, fisheries, and ecology, etc., many Caribbean students attend universities in North America, Europe, or the Soviet Union. Predominant in providing financial assistance for higher education have been agencies from USA (USAID), Canada (IDRC and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The public sector usually sponsors its own staff through associated multilateral and bilateral assistance projects in the country.
Since 1986 AQUILA has organized in collaboration with national institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean a number of training courses and other activities on various topics of aquaculture. These were:
- 8 regional training courses in 5 countries with a total participation of 164 representatives from 20 countries; the subjects of the courses were: pathology, nutrition, culture-based fisheries, post-harvest handling, and preservation technology, reproduction, sector planning and management, and marine hatchery technology;
- 11 national courses in 6 countries with a total participation of 323 attendees; these courses were in the following subjects: mollusc culture, lakes and impoundment fishery management, post-harvest handling and preservation, technology, nutrition, and culture of colossoma;
- 10 regional seminars of coordination and collaboration on Gracilaria culture, shrimp pathology, coastal lagoon management, inland water impoundment management, mollusc culture, and an Aquaculture Information Reference System (SIRIAC).
4.2 Manpower training in management
Non-technical subject matters of aquaculture, such as sector planning, farm management, project formulation and evaluation, marketing, legislation, and methodology of extension, have so far been neglected by most study programmes and curricula of the degrees offered by universities. This reflects the lack of expertise in these areas, all of which are vital for the development of the sector. Moreover, none of the national public management training institutions in the region has offered specialized courses for government aquaculture staff who, although already graduates, have little experience in the management of government institutions, aquaculture production units, hatcheries and laboratories, and credit programmes.
The Regional Aquaculture Centre in Brazil was established by UNDP/FAO for the training of senior aquaculturists (mostly from government departments) but the course did not address aspects of management. In recognizing this deficiency, AQUILA has organized an annual Basic Course on Planning and Management of Aquaculture with the objective of strengthening public administration capabilities. The first course was implemented in Mexico in 1988, and the second one was offered in 1989 in San Jose, Costa Rica.
With the objective of assessing general requirements for growth and development of aquaculture in CARICOM countries, and to identify support services, FAO through its Technical Cooperation Programme organized a Planning and Sensitization Seminar on Management for Aquaculture in 1987. A follow-up workshop was also organized to elaborate aquaculture education and training programmes, to determine their objectives, scope, contents, and other related activities essential to satisfy previously identified needs.
Aquaculture development in the region is also being promoted through the Caribbean Technical Cooperation Network in Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture sponsored by FAO. The Network is based on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC), with emphasis on training and technology. Since the creation of the Network in 1986 several study tours for decision-makers (and others) have been held.
4.3 Aquaculture research in the region
Fundamental and applied research in aquaculture are carried out by many of the universities in the region, specifically at institutes for marine and oceanographic research. There are many such centres in the main islands.
At the Centro de Investigaciones Pesqueras in La Habana, Cuba there is research on local marine species, such as Crassostrea rhizophorea, Penaeus schmitti and P. notialis, Mugil curuma, Ocyurus chrysurus, and Lutjanus spp., as well as hybrids of Tilapia spp. for the production of red tilapia.
At the University of the West Indies research is carried out on its three campuses in Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago. Most of the research and training is concentrated in the Department of Zoology at Mona (Kingston, Jamaica). Research programmes deal with tilapia, spirulina, green turtles, and some freshwater fishes.
At the Université des Antilles et de la Guyane in Guadeloupe there is work on breeding local clams, and growth of local fish in pens and cages.
At the Institute of Marine Affairs in Trinidad there are facilities for research on freshwater fish, and the work is mainly on the reproduction of cascadura (Hoplosternum littorale).
In the French Antilles, IFREMER, a public institution of the French Government, is engaged in research on the freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium spp.) and the red drum (Sciaenops oscellatus).
Many of the national governments have established special research units within their respective fisheries departments to carry out applied research on specific projects, for example, on the culture of seaweed in the Lesser Antilles, on freshwater fish in Jamaica, on tilapia and freshwater prawn in St. Vincent, and on tilapia culture in Haiti.
There is little cooperation between the different research institutions in the region, even those working on the same species. One existing network is organized for the exchange of written information through the FAO Caribbean Network in Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture. Several of the research centres participate in certain aquaculture sessions occasionally organized by the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute at the annual sessions.
4.4 Management of credit
Credit for the aquaculture sector is usually managed and organized as a component of a larger related sector, such as agriculture or fisheries. In most of the countries of the region credit for agriculture is provided by the national agricultural development banks. In the French Antilles there is a channel through a cooperative bank for fisheries.
In CARICOM countries loans with low interest can be obtained from EDF through the CDB. In the Greater Antilles, and some of the most developed Lesser Antilles, commercial banks receive requests for funding larger projects.
In most countries neither the national agricultural development banks nor other specialized development institutions have the required experienced personnel to evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of aquaculture projects. Jamaica is an exception. The Agricultural Credit Bank of Jamaica, Ltd., the Jamaica National Investment Promotion Ltd., the National Commerce Bank, the Jamaica Agricultural Development Foundation, and Agro-21 Corporation Ltd., among other state and private financial institutions participating in the promotion and development of aquaculture, have trained individuals who specialize in aquaculture.
In those countries with only small commercial aquaculture sectors one problem in the management of credit for the sector has been the absence of policies which fit the peculiarities of the specific activity. This has been particularly difficult with credit programmes for increasing fish culture among small-scale farmers. Potential borrowers have had little previous contact with the formal banking sector, and policies of the banks do not often permit extended credit based on the collateral available to such farmers, such as the ponds and value of the livestock. Corporate producers, on the other hand, who are more used to banking policies and practices and have collateral (the land beneath the ponds), have repeatedly used the credit arrangements provided by banks.
4.5 Associations of professionals in the region
ALA is one of the few associations for professionals in the region. It has 1 300 members representing some 200 institutions and companies from 27 countries and is headquartered in Lima, Peru. Both Cuba and Dominican Republic are represented in ALA.
The Caribbean Aquaculture Association, based in Puerto Rico, groups professionals and producers from many countries of the region. One of its outstanding achievements was organization of the Caribbean Aquaculture and Trade Expo '87, which allowed the scientific community opportunity to exchange experiences and learn about the latest developments in its member countries. The event also helped the industry and the academic community to broaden their networks of colleagues and resources. The event highlighted state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and services available to the regional market.
A number of professionals from the national universities and research institutes are members of WAS, particularly those who have been educated or trained in the USA and Europe; and many of these same individuals are indirectly participating members of the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute. The American Fisheries Society also attracts professionals from the region, particularly as the Society has a number of working groups on aquaculture topics.
4.6 Information for professionals
There is no scientific and technical publication which deals specifically with aquaculture in the region. The proceedings of meetings of the Gulf and Caribbean Institute contain occasional information about the sector.
One publication for the exchange of news on aquaculture in the Caribbean is the Network News. This is published periodically by the FAO Regional Fisheries Officer in charge of the Caribbean Technical Cooperation Network in Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture.
"Revista Latinoamericana de Acuicultura", published by OLDEPESCA of which Cuba is a member country, contains three basic sections, namely news, technical and scientific articles, and bibliographical data. It is a source of information on as-yet unpublished research and production data of direct interest to the region.
ALA recently began to publish a two-monthly bulletin, "ALA Informativo", which is circulated to its members.
The Universidad de La Habana in Cuba publishes "Ciencias e Investigaciones Marinas" which contains various articles on aquaculture. The "Revista Cubana de Investigaciones Pesqueras" is more concerned with culture-based fisheries. The "Boletín Técnico de Acuicultura" is also relevant to professionals.
Professionals in the region have access to information through personal subscriptions to the large number of publications produced in the USA and Europe. These include the following journals, "Aquaculture" (published in the Netherlands); "Aquaculture Engineering", "Journal of Fish Biology", and "Journal of Fish Diseases" (all in the UK); "Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences" (Canada); and "Progressive Fish Culturist" (USA).
Useful articles for professionals are also found in trade magazines and papers, such as "Aquaculture Magazine", "Fisheries", and "Farm Pond Harvest" (USA), and "Fish Farming International" and "Fish Farmer" (UK). Important news items are also found in "Aquaculture Digest" (USA).
There are few interregional publications, with the exception of the INFOFISH International, a two-monthly magazine produced in association with INFOPESCA (see 1.6) which occasionally contains articles on aquaculture relevant to the region.
WAS publishes a journal which is free to members, as well as a Newsletter. WAS also produces special volumes on aquaculture technology which are available at reduced rates to members.
The largest source of information for aquaculture professionals is FAO at its Headquarters in Rome, Italy. The FAO Fisheries Department produces a series of publications, many of which are relevant to aquaculture. These are FAO Fisheries Reports, FAO Fisheries Technical Papers, and FAO Fisheries Synopses. All titles are categorized and produced regularly. Some documents are free and others are priced.
FAO maintains a database in which aquaculture information can be found. ASFA is an international bibliographic database providing comprehensive coverage of publications on the science, technology, and management of marine and freshwater environments. The database can be searched via terminals and personal computers to retrieval systems in Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the USA; and it is also available on compact disc. Aquaculture Abstracts from ASFA are available also in printed form through subscription.
The FAO Fisheries Department Library is probably the largest repository of books on fisheries and related topics, many of which are on aquaculture subjects. It maintains a large serial collection of all subjects related to fish and fisheries from fisheries institutes, government departments, and commercial publishers throughout the world, and a special collection of documents on a country basis and subject files.
In recognizing the needs of exchange of information on aquaculture among researchers and professionals, AQUILA instituted SIRIAC compatible with CARIS/FAO (Current Agricultural Research Information System). National research institutions, individual researchers, libraries and other documentation centres have been invited to submit information on current aquaculture research to form the database of this information system compiled in MICRO/CDS/ISI software distributed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). Initially 6 countries (Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela) participated in this project, although it is envisaged that all other countries of the region will eventually integrate themselves into SIRIAC, which would thus constitute one of the main sources of information for professionals and researchers within the region. Mexico is the designated host for SIRIAC.
4.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
Amongst the activities included in this sub-sector of national infrastructure, support has been directed mainly at aquaculture research and training in aquaculture technologies.
Aquaculture research has received widespread assistance (both geographically and with species) from IDRC and the International Foundation for Science (IFS). This support usually takes the form of research grants. Most recipients of grants are based in national universities and other research institutions. Their research is often basic in nature but usually concerns either a species or a subject of direct relevance to aquaculture. Countries presently receiving support are Haiti, Cuba, and St. Lucia in disciplines related to larval rearing, reproduction, and equipment for government fish farms.
Aquaculture training in Jamaica has been supported by USAID. Between 1969 and 1983 some US$ 600 000 were used for training of personnel and US$ 60 000 worth of equipment was donated to the Zoology Department of the University of the West Indies. Other support for research on the rearing of larvae of commercially valuable species of shellfish came from EDF through the EEC Lome II and III Conventions. IDRC also supported an oyster culture research project with a grant of Can.$ 196 000.
The Dominican Republic has received over US$ 1 million from IFS, OAS, IDRC, USAID, and the Governments of Italy, the Soviet Union, and Taiwan PC for research and training projects. Much of this assistance has been channelled through NGOs dedicated to aquaculture promotion, such as the Research Centre for the Improvement of Animal Production, the Social Service of the Dominican Churches, the Natura Dominicana Foundation (in collaboration with Marine Systems Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution), and the Pro-Research and Conservation Dominican Foundation.
USAID has been a substantial source of technical assistance in the region, either directly in research or through post-graduate training in aquaculture at universities in the USA, particularly Auburn University and the University of Rhode Island.
Since 1986 AQUILA, funded by the Government of Italy and executed by FAO, has as one of its principal objectives support for research and training. The project also produces and disseminates information through its research networks, and in training topics, including planning and management. AQUILA is based in Brazil but its activities have covered 19 countries, 2 of which belong to the region.
4.8 Capital assistance
Bilateral agencies (particularly CIDA and USAID) limit their capital assistance to technical equipment (and some outdoor ponds) rather than building construction, and only to established research centres managed by the public sector. France, through France-Aquaculture, has contributed to the construction of freshwater prawn culture demonstration and training facilities in both Guadeloupe and Martinique.
IDRC has funded the construction of several demonstration pilot farms for the cultivation of sea moss in St. Lucia, while the International Centre for Ocean Development is funding similar facilities in Grenada.
Little if any capital assistance is contributed to the construction of training institutions. Support which has been given for training has often (and particularly for multilateral assistance) been conditional on the host governments providing all funds for physical infrastructure. UNDP is upgrading a demonstration and training state hatchery in Haiti.

5.4 Trade and business associations
5.5 Information resources for management
5.6 Technical assistance projects In the sub-sector
5.1 Government policy in the region
In the Greater Antilles aquaculture is repeatedly and publicly identified as one of the priority sectors in which rapid expansion is expected. In Jamaica and Cuba long-term aquaculture development programmes are being carried out with large supporting budgets. In Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Trinidad aquaculture is often mentioned in policy statements and plans, but the available national financial resources for aquaculture promotion are limited and inadequately distributed. Typically, there is a concentration of staff in the central administration and in research centres, and a lack of funds to cover extension services, operating costs of pilot-stations or hatcheries, and capital assistance to the producers.
It was recommended at the second CARICOM Technical Seminar on Fisheries (Kingston, 1982) that all member states devise, as a matter of urgency, aquaculture development policies. Aquaculture is therefore included by the majority of governments in current fisheries or agriculture development plans as a priority area. However, the lack of experienced staff continues to be a major constraint to planning and development of the sector. In most countries key components, such as planning, credit, economics, and environmental concerns, continue to be neglected.
The governments of the region predominantly state similar policies for the sector. Their main objectives are to increase fish production, improve the institutional level, improve the foreign exchange balance by limiting imports of fish for local or tourist consumption, and exporting high value products (such as marine shrimps from Cuba). Also to increase rural employment and incomes of farmers and fishermen through aquaculture, and finally to improve the utilization of land and water resources and other by-products of national industries.
National action plans, complete with budgets, have been produced by Cuba and Jamaica. In French Antilles aquaculture is considered a priority by Regional Councils and national Governments, and by the EEC through its support for development of fish production and for development of less developed regions. In St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and the Bahamas, aquaculture is included in fishery development plans implemented with the assistance of FAO through its Technical Cooperation Programme, or with bilateral assistance.
5.2 Government organizations in the region
In most countries of the region responsibility for aquaculture is vested in the respective Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, some of which have a separate department or division for fisheries.
In the Lesser Antilles these services are under-staffed (usually only 1-3 fisheries officers), and there is no separate aquaculture capability or service. One of the fishery officers is usually designated the responsibility but his activities are often limited by lack of training and experience. Expertise is often required from outside the region.
In the Greater Antilles aquaculture receives better attention from the governments. In Cuba aquaculture is under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Fisheries Industry, with research under the Centre de Investigaciones Pesqueras and development/production by Empresa Nacional de Acuicultura. These two institutions are well staffed with experienced personnel.
In Jamaica the Inland Fisheries Unit has its own extension branch. It is established within the Department of Fisheries in the Ministry of Agriculture. The unit has 30 qualified central staff and 75 field staff, and manages research, training, extension services, and fry production.
In Haiti aquaculture is managed by the Service des Pêches et de la Pisciculture, Direction des Ressources Naturelles, Ministère de l'Agriculture des Ressources Naturelles et du Dèveloppement Rural. This service is under-staffed but has responsibilities for the management of a research station, training, and extension services. The UNDP/FAO project is assisting in institution building.
In Dominican Republic the Unidad de Piscicultura, Departamento de Recursos Pesqueros, Secretaría de Estado de Agricultura, is in charge of the aquaculture sector. Research is conducted by this service, together with three other public and non-governmental institutions. Although the regional administration has staff responsible for extension there is a lack of training and experience, and a shortage of operating funds.
In Grenada the Artisanal Fisheries Development Project is the body responsible for the management of the fisheries sector and falls under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Cooperatives and Fisheries. The National Science and Technology Council is the organization responsible for research.
In Trinidad aquaculture is managed by the Ministry of Food Production, Marine Exploitation, Forestry and the Environment. Research and development is the responsibility of another institution, the Institute of Marine Affairs in the Ministry of Planning and Reconstruction.
In the French Antilles marine aquaculture is the responsibility of the Secretariat d'Etat à la Mer, and freshwater aquaculture under the Ministry of Agriculture. Research and technical assistance are provided by IFREMER.
5.3 Aquaculture legislation
Few countries in the region have enacted specific legislation for aquaculture as yet. The French Antilles have national legislation for the use of water, both fresh and marine, and this therefore affects water intakes for aquaculture practices. For the use of coastal areas, which are considered public places owned by the government, leasing of areas for aquaculture sites is possible for a 15-year period, with an option to renew. In Antigua all coastal areas are also owned by the government but there is no provision for leasing them; however, technically it is possible to arrange a 10-year lease with an option to renew.
In Bahamas the Government received assistance from FAO in 1983 to complete a number of aquaculture regulations for development. The country has draft legislation on aquaculture but the present level of activity makes it almost inapplicable. Present aquaculture operations are conducted under permits from the Department of Fisheries. Operators are required to pay an annual fee of US$ 50 per research operation, and US$ 500 for commercial activities. Fisheries inspectors can visit an operation facility at any time, and producers are required to provide an annual report on their commercial activities.
In St. Lucia during 1982 and 1983 subsidies were made available for pond construction, financing up to 33.3% of the cost of excavation. Economic difficulties, however, led to the cancelling of such policy.
In Dominican Republic aquaculture legislation falls under Law No. 5914 of 1961. Several decrees legislate the importation of live aquatic resources and on importation tariffs. Law No. 311 exempts aquaculture activities from taxes. The National Land Registrar, the Dominican Agrarian Institute, and the Sugar State Council have requested legal advice from the Fisheries Resources Department on the regulation of land for aquaculture purposes. Water use is regulated by the National Institute of Water Resources which, until now, has not objected to any use of water for aquaculture.
In Cuba legislation on the exploitation of fisheries resources is contained in the General Law of Fisheries of 1936. As it is outdated, aquaculture is mostly regulated by Temporal Dispositions ordained by the Ministry of the Fishing Industry, which is presently elaborating a new law for the legislation of both inland and marine fisheries.
There are regulations for financial assistance to aquaculture producers in the French Antilles. There are tax exemptions for foreign companies investing in Dominican Republic, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles, Jamaica, Bahamas, and Bermuda.
Environmental regulations affecting aquaculture in the region either do not exist or are specific. As yet there are no restrictions on the introduction of species from outside, or on transfers between islands provided a certificate of health is obtained from a veterinary service. One regulation from outside the region which effects Cayman Islands is the introduction of certain protected species into the USA. Consequently a commercial producer of green turtle has had to restrict production to the local and non-USA markets for both meat and shell products.
5.4 Trade and business associations
With the exception of associations of local producers and professionals, (see sections 2.5 and 4.5) there are no national trade or business associations which have been established in the interests of unifying national production or the export of aquaculture products.
The St. Lucia Fish Marketing Corporation is a fish processing complex established with the assistance of CIDA. In Jamaica fish farmers are considering a more active role for their association for growth and progress of the industry, but nothing has yet been formalized.
5.5 Information resources for management
There are few, if any, resources of information for management produced in the region. There are a number of newsletters which contain a range of information for all levels of the sector, such as Network News produced by the FAO Caribbean Technical Cooperation Network in Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture, and "Acuicultura" produced by the FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean for its Aquaculture Network; "ALA Informativo", "Aquarius", and the "Revista Latinoamericana de Acuicultura", INFOFISH International, INFOPESCA, and Aquaculture Digest (see 1.6 and 4.6).
Publications by AQUILA contain information relevant to planning and management of the sector in the region, such as the Proceedings of the Technical Meeting on Aquaculture Planning, held in Caracas, Venezuela (8-12 May 1989).
Useful management information is provided by FAO through ADCP. ADCP publishes a quarterly newsletter, called Aquaculture Minutes, and other relevant documents in the form of guidelines and advisory papers, and through individual mission reports.
The most relevant management circular, which at times has relevance for the region, is Eurofish Report. This is a two-weekly review of European and world fishing and fisheries, with comprehensive coverage of EEC legislation and the Common Fisheries Policy. It contains much information about aquaculture, including EEC grants and loans, legislation, new investments, joint ventures, and supplies and prices.
5.6 Technical assistance projects In the sub-sector
A number of technical assistance projects have been established for management at the regional level, most of them executed by FAO.
Within the framework of the Caribbean Technical Cooperation Network in Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture, FAO implemented through its Technical Cooperation Programme a project to strengthen Jamaica's Inland Fisheries Unit to support training courses for participants from Caribbean countries.
In 1980, in cooperation with the UNDP/FAO project "Interregional Fisheries Development and Management Programme", ADCP reviewed the status and potential of aquaculture in the region, and formulated recommendations for development of the sector in the small island states. It concluded that a regional programme of research and development was essential as it would enable effective use of national and regional resources. As a result, a joint ADCP/FAO and CARICOM aquaculture mission was fielded in 1982 to provide background information on the potential for aquaculture in the sub-region and to determine the interest in a regional approach to development similar to the ADCP's four other regional programmes in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Mediterranean, all of which were supported by UNDP. It recommended creation of a regional centre in the Caribbean to serve the needs of both large and small island states, particularly the English-speaking countries.
Subsequently, a proposal for the creation of a Caribbean Regional Aquaculture Centre was prepared by FAO and endorsed by Jamaica as the selected host country. This proposal was submitted by CARICOM in 1986 to Lome HI/EEC under its agricultural sector programme, but has not been approved. In order to provide an information bridge before the start of the project, FAO implemented a project "Organization and Management Training for Aquaculture Development". Its purpose was to assess general requirements for growth and development of aquaculture in CARICOM states and identify support services needed. It also tried to elaborate objectives for the training programme of the proposed regional centre. These objectives were identified at an Aquaculture Planning and Sensitization Seminar and an Aquaculture Training Development Workshop held in the region in 1987.
FAO, also through its Technical Cooperation Programme, implemented a sub-regional project to harmonize and coordinate fishery legislation and agreements, which had some small relevance to aquaculture. The purpose was to assist the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). It produced an educational handbook for fishermen and vocational trainees in schools to increase their awareness of the need for legislation.

6. REGIONAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT
6.1 United Nations organizations in the region
6.2 Other organizations in the region
6.3 Economic communities of the region
6.4 Regional and global aquaculture development projects
6.1 United Nations organizations in the region
The Caribbean countries are active in a number of regional organizations in which aquaculture has been recognized as a component of fisheries or agriculture, and which has received support in some form.
The principal regional organizations are those of the United Nations (UN) in which all Caribbean countries actively participate as members, and a number of economic communities which have smaller memberships.
Most countries participate in the individual organizations of the UN system, such as FAO, IFAD, UNDP, Unesco, and the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the World Bank (WB), and its regional development bank, the IDB. UNDP and FAO have offices in each of the Greater Antilles (Haiti, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Jamaica), and in Trinidad and Tobago and in Barbados for the Lesser Antilles.
In the 1970s FAO established the Western Central Atlantic Fisheries Commission (WECAFC); the Commission also included for the Eastern Antilles a Lesser Antilles Committee. The general objective of WECAFC is to increase the exchange of information in the region in fisheries and aquaculture. The purpose of the Lesser Antilles Committee is to increase cooperation and coordination between the smaller countries in the fields of stock assessment, statistics, and legislation. The bodies hold few activities with respect to aquaculture, and the sector was not mentioned at all during the annual meetings in 1987.
6.2 Other organizations in the region
With the exception of Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, all the Caribbean countries are ACP (Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific) Countries which are eligible for grants and loans from the EEC. Until now these possibilities have not been used for aquaculture, but a new project for tilapia culture in Trinidad is under review. The EEC, through the EDF, has been a significant source of capital assistance to the sector.
The OECS, in which 7 states of the Lesser Antilles are grouped, has implemented a fishery unit in St. Vincent but until now it has been more involved in artisanal fisheries than aquaculture.
6.3 Economic communities of the region
The principal economic organization in the region is CARICOM. It was formed in 1973 to foster trade and promote economic integration and cooperation among its members. CARICOM has 13 member countries, 10 of them in the Antilles. Dominican Republic and Haiti are not members of CARICOM but are observers. An agreement was signed during the 19th FAO Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean between FAO and CARICOM to promote the development of aquaculture in the region.
CARICOM provides loans through the CDB for investment in the sector, with the assistance of EEC.
6.4 Regional and global aquaculture development projects
AQUILA, which is based in Brazil, provides support to Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean for training opportunities and information in aquaculture. The project is supported by the Government of Italy and executed by FAO. The project organizes annual training courses but so far few trainees have come from the Caribbean region. For this reason, and because of the specific conditions of the Caribbean islands, it is still proposed by the region to have its own regional development project. The initial idea was to create a Caribbean Regional Aquaculture Centre but, after a meeting organized in 1987 in Jamaica on aquaculture planning, it was suggested that existing national centres should be strengthened and formed into a regional network. At present funds have yet to be committed, and discussions between the region and EEC are continuing. In the meantime, FAO has provided funds to organize regional activities (see 5.6).
Finally, UNDP created the ADCP in support of global initiatives in aquaculture. Its activities have extended into Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Mediterranean region. Advisory and guideline publications deal with both administration of the sector, such as technical assistance, economic development, planning, engineering, and marketing, and in technology.

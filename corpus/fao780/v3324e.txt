I. Introduction
I. Introduction
The First Plan for Equal Opportunities for Women (1988-1990), which was coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs, identified the need for an in-depth study into the socio-professional status of rural women in Spain.
As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (hereinafter MAFF) designed and promoted the implementation (1989-1990) of a detailed study which was carried out by the consultancy firm, IOPE-ETMAR, and the Department of Rural Sociology at the Faculty of Political Science and Sociology of Complutense University in Madrid.
This paper looks into the more salient criteria, methodology aspects and findings of the survey, bearing in mind the general FAO guidelines of the Third Progress Report on the Implementation of the Plan of Action for Integration of Women in Development and those of the Regional Office for Europe for the Seventh Session of the Working Party on Women and the Agricultural Family in Rural Development, under the theme: "The family as the basic socioeconomic unit in rural development - future focus".
The study essentially involved:
1. The identification, classification and analysis of all bibliography and newspaper articles produced between 1960 and 1989 on the socio-professional status of women in agriculture, with particular regard to the EC countries. A total of 1 097 computer entries were classified in terms of topic/geographic area.
2. A critical analysis of official statistics to study the role of women in agriculture and define evaluation indicators.
This is a particularly useful contribution in the light of FAO's efforts to provide Member Nations with gender-responsive policy advice, as reported in paragraph 81 of its Third Progress Report on the Implementation of the Plan of Action for Integration of Women in Development.
3. An examination of women's status in European agriculture and how this affects discussions in EC academic and policy fore on recognition of the professional status of women farmers on family farms. A comparative analysis was done on women's employment, training, vocational association and modalities for their socio-technical integration in the various agricultural communities.
4. Analysis of the status of rural women from the juridical perspective, with reference to Spanish, EC and international law. Special attention was paid to private-sector domestic law (common law and provincial law) and public- sector domestic law (common law and Autonomous Community law).
5. Finally, the actual sociological study, for which the objectives, methodology and main findings are presented below.
Technical cooperation between the MAFF team that designed and supervised the study and the research team responsible for its implementation was systematic throughout.
The more important findings of the study were published by the MAFF in various volumes under the series: "Socio-professional Status of Women in Agriculture".

II. Sociological research methodology
II. Sociological research methodology
The methodology was based on the integrated use of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. More specifically, the qualitative stage comprised 14 group discussions, 36 in-depth interviews and six meetings with experts, in different agrarian environments. It is worth highlighting the importance of this qualitative stage which set out to:
a) Procure reference material to study how rural women perceive the agricultural world and rural society.
b) Provide descriptive information on the status of farm women, identifying attitudes and opinions that cannot be captured by standard questionnaire.
c) Contribute towards the design of the questionnaire and sample.
Process of integration of the observation and analytical instruments
Sampling constituent process
The quantitative stage comprised four samples: a central sample of 6203 farm women; and three secondary samples of 399 women employed on farms on a permanent or temporary basis; 403 women employed permanently or casually in the marketing, processing or manufacture of agricultural goods; and a reference sample of 205 men from family farms (FF). The FF sample had a confidence level of 99% (3 _), with a margin of error of ± 2%.
The study's scope of reference, the sampling principles and the final selection of sample individuals were guided by the central objective of analysing the role of women in agriculture.
The central observation unit was the farm household, with the women as holders or related to the holder (basically as spouse, mother or daughter). Efforts were made to include those women in each household most active in farm work.
The research universe was divided into 16 agricultural environments to reflect the differences in the women's role in Spain's various agrarian systems^1. A two-tiered classification was then carried out within each agricultural environment: first, rural municipalities according to population size and, second, population settlements according to size and dispersal pattern. The final questionnaire recipients were determined by random selection of municipalities and settlements in each of the agricultural environments.
^1 These agricultural environments were determined on the basis of an agricultural demarcation previously undertaken by the MAFF. They were used to determine sample categories and as an important independent analytical variable.
Three questionnaires were used with a common basic structure for the three groups studied: women on family holdings, women agricultural wage earners and those employed in agribusiness; and a specific part for each group. The questionnaire began with general information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the interviewee and her family, farm production and the ecological situation. The central focus of the questionnaire was:
· Vocational and training background.
· Type of agricultural work carried out by the women.
· Women's perception of the present and future farm situation.
· Evaluation of institutional policies to promote rural women socio-professionally.
· Forms of agricultural association and trade unionism: participation and attitudes of farm women.
The questionnaire included 137 items, which had been previously discussed and tested, and which amply covered the various aspects that govern the status of women on the family farm and in the agri-food sector in general.

III.1 The rural woman in official statistics
Though official statistics are undeniably deficient in accurately portraying such a complex and indeterminate social phenomenon as the role of women in agriculture, they are critical to framing the quantitative dimensions of the target population group.
III.1.1 The work of the rural woman in the Active Population Survey (APS)
The work of the rural woman in the Active Population Survey (APS)^2
^2 Though the APS is analytically useful to determine the structure of the labour market, the sample design and the conceptual definitions of the survey objective make it difficult to examine the work of women in agriculture whose views, particularly regarding the family farm situation, cannot be measured in terms of official statistics. More information on this matter can be found in: "Situación socioprofesional de la mujer en la agricultura - Tomo II - "La Mujer en las estadísticas oficiales" - MAPA - 1991: and in the article by C. García Sanz: "Revision de conceptos de la EPA" Revista Española de Investigaciones Sociológicas - N° 61 - Madrid 1993.
Table 1 details the structure of the active Spanish agricultural population by gender in 1991.

According to this survey, most women actively involved in agriculture are wage earners (usually casual labour), unpaid family members (working on the farm of a relative with whom they live) and farm operators without hired labour (a denomination that can give rise to confusion and is comparable to the "holder" of the Agricultural Census).
Table 2 indicates the distribution of the active population by gender, the geographical distribution of women employed in agriculture and their proportion in relation to the other production sectors (per Autonomous Community). Women represent 8% of the total active female population (though with notable deviations from the mean, from 35% in Galicia to 0.13% in Madrid) and 28% of the total active agricultural population (below the Community average of about 35%).

One important characteristic of farm women is their age. Approximately 45 % were over 50 years of age according to the survey, much older than the men.
III.1.2 The rural woman in the Agricultural Census of 1989
The rural woman in the Agricultural Census of 1989^3
^3 The last Agricultural Census covered holdings on the national territory as of 30 September 1989, whoever the individual or cooperative holder and whatever the end-use of the agricultural output.
Agricultural work covers all human activity that contributes to the economic results of the holding. In view of its importance for the topic under study, it should be noted that agricultural work on the farm does not include domestic chores or manufacture of by-products from the farm output undertaken by persons belonging to the respective production units.
These exclusions are clearly very important when it comes to evaluating the role of women in agriculture given that a large part of their activity deals precisely with these areas.
The Agricultural and Population Censuses provide useful information for the topic under study. The information needs to be critically reviewed and compared (as is done later) with sectoral studies using qualitative analytical techniques that alone can provide a more accurate indication of the woman's role in agriculture, and particularly on the family farm.

Tables 3, 4 and 5 lead us to the following conclusions:
1. Without neglecting the importance of women's casual wage labour in agriculture (an aspect that warrants specific examination), the rural women's contribution is mainly that of a theoretically unremunerated household member (more so than the men's).
2. Women holders and particularly holder/heads of farm are mainly found among the older generations (63% of women holder/heads of farm were over 55 years of age) and in agricultural environments with a large proportion of small farms (Galicia has 26% of all the women holders). Very often farm ownership results from the death of the husband, for instance, and as one means of benefiting from protectionist agrarian policies.
Both the Agricultural Census and other studies reported below clearly indicate that the women's involvement in farm work increases in inverse proportion to size of holding. This situation has led commentators to talk of the "subordinate position of women in family agriculture"^4.
^4 Mazariegos, J. et al: "Mujer y ruralidad. El círculo guebrado" Instituto de la Mujer - Madrid - 1991, and "La implicación de la mujer en la agriculture familiar: apuntes sobre el proceso de desagrarización en España". Revista Política y Sociedad - N° 9 Madrid, 1991.
3. Though the number of women classified as spouses and holders were similar, the number of spouse "heads of farm" (i.e. responsible for daily farm management) was negligible - for the most part in the older age groups (13% above 65 and 50% above 55) and mainly in Galicia (70% of the total) on small uneconomic holdings.
III.2 Main socio-cultural characteristics of farm women
The survey findings were also examined in terms of the independent socio-economic variables of age and level of education. These are essential to assess accurately the importance of the women's role in family households and how they see the future for the farm and the rural community.
III.2.1 Age
1. The women most active on the smallholding were very often in the older age groups nationally 45% were over 55. This was somewhat below the figure from the Agricultural Census of 1989. The percentage increased considerably in those agricultural environments with the least viable holdings^5.
^5 The "old age" threshold of 55 years conforms to the criteria of Royal Decree 22/1991 of 18 January and Decree 1178/1989 of 29 September which establish a regime of assistance to encourage early retirement from agricultural activity for farm household members.
The highest proportions of older farm women were found in the Pyrenees (47%), the Cantabrian Cordillera (41 %) and the Atlantic Coast (39%) which are largely less-favoured regions.
2. In contrast, the agricultural environments with numbers of younger women above the national average (24.5%) were the Sistema Bético (42.8%) and the Andalusian Coast (40.7%)^6.
^6 Similarly, the cut-off point for the younger age group is 35 years in accordance with policy and administrative criteria and legal provisions to encourage the integration of the young in agriculture.
3. The older women tend for the most part to be widows (76%) and are largely titleholders. The married women, who usually function as unpaid family labour, are situated in the 35-55 year age group (47.3%) with those above 55 accounting for 37.6% of the total. Most of the young women are single with 84% below the age of 35.
4. The older women work on the "uneconomic" holdings (32% over 55) and a large percentage of retired women above 65 (26%) continue to work on the farm.
III.2.2 Level of education
This variable is particularly important to understand the differences in attitude and behaviour among the groups studied, and the generation gap that exists in Spanish rural society.
The highest levels of illiteracy are found among women wage labourers and the highest levels of education among women employed in agri-business (Table 6).
If we look exclusively at the 16-24 age group, the percentage of women with post-primary education rises considerably, as do differences in socio-cultural behaviour when compared to the rural women as a whole (Table 7).
The level of education in farm households varies considerably from one region to another. Though, nationally, 36.3% have primary schooling, the proportion rises to 69% in the Ebro Basin, but falls to 24% in the Southern Sub-meseta. The national level of illiteracy of 8.5% in fact varies regionally from 17.4% in Guadalquivir-Genil-Campiñas to only 2% in the Duero Meseta.
There are major differences among the various generation groups and notable differences in levels of formal education. While there are virtually no younger women without schooling, this changes among the 45-year-olds, rising to 14.6% in the 55-65 age group and 17.4% among the over-65s. Similarly, the percentage of younger women (under 35) in farm households with post-primary schooling (39%) is much higher than the overall average (10%).

III.2.3 Women and work on the family farm
The confusion that exists, sometimes in the minds of the women themselves, between domestic and farm work inevitably blurs the distinction between productive and reproductive work, a situation which does not arise with the men's work^7. Woman's work is discontinuous, irregular and extremely varied, which makes it difficult for the women themselves and of course for conventional statistics to make an objective evaluation.
^7 Whatmore, S. ¿Ciclo vital or patriarcado?. (Changes in the gender division of labour in the farm household). REAS N° 161 - MAPA - 1989 - Canovés G. et al "Mujeres agricultoras, esposas agricultoras: Un trabajo invisible en las explotaciones familiares" - REAS N° 147 MAPA - 1990.
An examination of data from holdings affiliated to the National Agrarian Accounts Network^8 and specific research^9, assessing the type of work carried out by rural women and the time involved, provides a clearer picture and empirically confirms that the woman's work is essential linked to the maintenance and reproduction of the family farm, particularly the very small one.
^8 García Bartolomé, J.M. "El trabajo de la mujer agricultora en las explotaciones familiares agrarias españolas" ND 161 - Revista de Estudios Agrosociales - MAPA - 1992 y en "La mujer agricultora ante el futuro del mundo rural" (unpublished thesis - 1991).
^9 Mazariegos, J. et al "Situacíon socioprofesional de la mujer en la agricultura" (T:V: - Análisis Sociológico) - MAPA - 1993, García Ramón, et al, "Explotación agraria familiar y trabajo de la mujer: estudio comparativo de Andalucía, Cantabria y Galicia".
The research findings on the women's role on the family farm can be classified as follows:
1. Highly "feminized" agricultural environments (over 50% of the interviewees exclusively employed on the family farm): Northeast Peninsula, Atlantic Coast, Cantabrian Cordillera and the Balearic and Canary Islands.
These are farming systems in which the women are closely tied to the land, and in which there are strong links between home and farm, particularly in the Cantabrian region. The women are mostly involved in little-mechanized dairy production and horticulture in these areas. This group includes the Duero Meseta (mainly cereal production) and the Andalusian Coast (intensive horticulture).
2. Relatively "feminized" agricultural environments (30 to 50% exclusively involved on the family farm): the Central Cordillera, Pyrenees and Prepyrenees, Andalusian Coast, Catalonian and Eastern Interior and Coast, the Southern Sub-meseta and the Ebro Basin.
3. Agricultural environments with low "feminization" (under 30%): the Extremenduran Plains, the Sierra Morena Grasslands, the Sistemas Bético/Penibético and Guadalquivir-Genil-Campiñas (this area has a high level of wage labour).
Research on time spent on farm and household work indicates long working days, particularly on smallholdings and where the home is physically part of the farm. The women do most of the traditional chores, particularly house cleaning and care. Findings for the daily work of women in three regions (Galicia, Andalusia and Catalonia) are similar to those from the national MAFF survey.
Farm work - particularly tending livestock - takes up a very large proportion of the women's time in inland Galicia (a total of 13 hours in summer and 10 in winter).

This sectoral research provides a more accurate insight into the role played by women on the family farm than do official statistics. In concrete terms, the agricultural activities in which the women are most heavily involved concern livestock (milking, tending, feeding and cleaning), particularly in the agricultural environments of the Atlantic Coast and the Cantabrian Cordillera (specifically the uneconomic holdings) and in intensive horticulture along the Mediterranean Coast. On a secondary level, the women also play an important role in harvesting in these areas and in the Balearic and Canary Islands. Similarly, they are active in the basic handling of agricultural produce throughout the Cantabrian Coast, in the Duero Meseta and on the Andalusian and Eastern-Catalan Coasts.
The rural woman, whether holder or spouse, is also an important source of (usually casual) agri-business labour in these environments. The national sociological survey found that the women's work in agro-industry mainly involved packaging, grading and product preparation - work that requires little skill and is generally arduous.
Case studies^10 on women's work in the Valencian citrus sector depict more accurately the role of women in handling and packaging citrus products. The research highlights the difficult working conditions and the need for considerable flexibility and availability (up to 16-hour days).
^10 Domingo Perez, C. "El trabajo de las mujeres en el sistema citrícola valenciano" - Cuadernos de Geografía (N° 53 - Valencia 1993).
In this way the "family member" category is acquiring a wage dimension, particularly among the younger women. This, in turn, is modifying farm household income structure in favour of off-farm revenue and is affecting social relations and perceptions within the rural family. This was also detected in other research work on the multiple activities of farms in the European Community^11.

III.2.4 Farm women and the future of the family holding and rural environment
At the time of the survey there was already a clear succession problem on farms in which women were actively involved. Approximately 16.6% of the farms were without a successor, rising to 33% and 32% respectively on the Atlantic Coast and in the Cantabrian Cordillera. In contrast, the highest proportions of farms with a definite successor were found in Guadalquivir-Genil-Campiñas, the Sistemas Bético/Penibético and on the Andalusian Coast.
Though the majority trend is migration from the land, particularly among the young women (only 27% of the women interviewed expressed satisfaction with their professional situation and only 5 % wanted their daughters to work on the farm), at the same time there was a high degree of satisfaction with the rural community. A total of 87% of the women interviewed wanted to remain in their village. This level was relatively uniform throughout, except in the Penibético region where it fell to 77 % (though there were differences among the age groups). Also, 45 % wanted their daughters to remain in the village (Tables 10, 11, 12 and 13).

IV. Main conclusions
IV. Main conclusions
The main conclusions from the study are:
1. The women's labour contribution, which is at times unreported in traditional statistics, is in fact essential for the survival and running of small family farms. However, the farm women normally play a substitute role - particularly on the unviable farms - and function as coworker ("family workforce") of the male holder on the more viable farms.
In certain parts of Spanish rural society, where the social fabric is still comparatively intact, the generation gap (from sharp cultural differences between generations) is breaking down the traditional patriarchal and "macho" order and encouraging the women to play a dynamic and modernizing role in agriculture and the rural development process.
2. With this more egalitarian cultural context emerging throughout Spanish society, young rural women are breaking the "traditional mould" of labour subordination and domestic dependence that had hitherto governed their status on the farm.
3. The growing importance of off-farm work is increasingly influencing the gender division of farm work. The multiple work activities of the household members - particularly the young women are also undermining the concept of family unity implicit in the definition of "agricultural household". The family farm is no longer the compact unit in which all generations had the same objective: the reproduction of the productive structures and family order.
4. The rural development model based on "family agriculture" which is profiled by supranational institutions responsible for agrarian policy has not yet translated into effective support for small family farms, where the bulk of rural women's work in fact occurs. What is more, the imminent structural adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy will affect the smaller holdings and therefore the farm women in particular, although it will undoubtedly open up new horizons for the rural environment and the agri-food sector and, obviously, for the women living in this environment and working in this sector.
5. Rural women, whether working on family farms or engaged in not specifically agricultural activities (now increasingly common in the rural environment) can undoubtedly play an important role in building the rural society of the future.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) is an Inter-Regional Project funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), executed by FAO, and based in Rome.
One of its tasks is to coordinate and provide technical and operational assistance for a number of regional aquaculture programmes. These include programmes in Africa (based in Nigeria), Asia (based in Thailand, with other centres in India, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China), and Latin America (in Brazil), all financed by UNDP and bilateral organizations.
The fourth of the current programmes is the Mediterranean Regional Aquaculture Programme (MEDRAP) headquartered in Tunisia. MEDRAP began in 1984 and is set up to assist in the operation of demonstration and pilot projects in the participating countries^1 which border on the Mediterranean. In addition, through the bilateral support of the Italian Government, MEDRAP carries out training in aquaculture including short-term sessions, study tours, and the implementation of a regional training centre for aquaculture technicians at Policoro in southern Italy on a commercial fish farm.
^1 The participating countries in MEDRAP at the time of the workshop were Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia.
ADCP, as part of its mandate to communicate information to advise and direct investment in aquaculture, is concentrating its attention on several non-biotechnical activities in aquaculture development which have so far been neglected. In the more advanced aquaculture regions, such as the Mediterranean and South-East Asia, the major constraints to further aquaculture development are no longer solely bio-technical - i.e., problems associated with the biological and environmental requirements for maintaining aquatic species in captivity. The main constraints are centred now around such sectoral topics as policy-making and planning, aquabusiness management, socio-anthropology, socio-economics, and, probably most important of all, the processing and marketing of aquaculture products.
The following report summarises the findings of the first of a series of workshops on the marketing of prime aquaculture species and their links with investment which ADCP will be organizing. This first workshop deals with the prime Mediterranean species - sea bass, sea bream, mullets and eel.
ADCP's objectives in holding this workshop were (i) to obtain marketing information on the four most important Mediterranean fish species, and (ii) to assist ADCP in advising and guiding investment in the industry by both the public and the private sectors. Almost all the Mediterranean countries have an interest in aquaculture, either to compensate for the diminishing fisheries resources of the region or to provide additional food for their increasing populations. Most of the countries which rim the Mediterranean are focusing on the same prime high-value species with the same international or national markets in view. ADCP feels that it has a responsibility to try to prevent over-investment in aquaculture in the region or, to put it another way, to provide the best information to allow investors to make appropriate decisions, whatever their priorities may be.
ADCP, as a result of the workshop held in December 1986, has therefore summarised information which can be used by:
- Assistance agencies, which might be asked to support an aquaculture project in one of the developing countries in the region;
- Development banks, which might be asked to finance large-scale construction, e.g., a large farm or hatchery;
- Governments, which might need to make planning decisions on the use of coastal resources, or
- Potential investors, who might wish to invest their own money in aquaculture enterprises.

2. FISH CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES
2.1 Sea bass and sea bream
2.2 Eel
2.3 Mullets
In 1984 total domestic landings in the Mediterranean area was 4 048 281 tons (Table 1). Imports accounted for about 46% of the total, while exports were about 19%. Apparent consumption was 5 128 596 tons. Total fish trade in the area showed a deficit of 1 080 315 tons, i.e. about 27% of total landings.
In terms of fish trade balance, among the countries examined during the workshop, only Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia showed positive figures. France, Italy and Yugoslavia had the largest deficits; in combination their share of the total fish trade balance was about 80%.
France, Spain and Morocco were by far the largest exporters; their combined share of total exports was about 70%. Exports from Turkey and Tunisia were limited, but mainly concentrated on high value species.
The principal importing countries were France, Italy and Spain, whose combined share of total imports in the area was about 68%. Algeria, Greece and Portugal showed a more limited dependence on imports, but the quantities of fish imported, in the range of 46 000 to 108 000 tons, were relatively high.
Self sufficiency in sea fish proteins was dramatically limited in many areas. Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, and Yugoslavia showed the lowest levels of self-sufficiency, from 6% for Syria to 21% for Yugoslavia (Table 1).
Lack of fish obviously has a negative impact on per caput consumption level. The per caput levels in Yugoslavia, Cyprus and Egypt are reported to be only 3.1 kg, 3.8 kg and 4.9 kg respectively (Table 2). Participants in the workshop were not able to provide a complete profile of the major species consumed in each country. However, it is well known that consumption in Algeria, Egypt and Yugoslavia is mainly based on low-value species resulting from the strong requirement for fish protein.

2.1 Sea bass and sea bream
In many countries sea bass and sea bream consumption is generally related to their local production availability. Consumers do not always attach the same value to these species; consequently fishermen do not always catch them. In any case, a share of total production is internally consumed. Whenever quantities of sea bass and sea bream are large enough, each country tends to develop an export trade directed mainly towards Italy. Spain, France and Greece are also interesting markets for these species.
In this regard, a representative example is given by Tunisia, whose total sea bass and sea bream production was 740 tons in 1986 (Table 5). This is mainly consumed internally even though prices are relatively high. Local wholesale prices in 1986 were reported to be T.Din. 5.4-8.6 (US$ 6.3-10.0)/kg for sea bass and from T.Din. 3.9-6.9 (US$ 4.5-8.0)/kg for sea bream. It is anticipated that the proportion of aquaculture production exported will increase from about 16% in 1987 to 67% by 1992 (Table 6) because of the recent relaxation of government controls.
The position in Greece and Turkey is similar. In both countries, consumption of sea bass and sea bream is steadily increasing. Greek consumers are reported to choose these two species more and more, even though prices are continuously increasing. Prices at December 1986 for these two species, according to the marketing channel utilized, varied from Gr.Dr. 700 to 1 600 (US$ 5.0-11.4)/kg. A major part of the Greek fish trade deficit is reported to be caused by the increasing consumption of prime quality products. In many countries, prices of imported sea bass and sea bream are lower than those of locally produced fish.
Production of sea bass and sea bream in Turkey is increasing because of internal and external demand pressures. At the moment prices are still well under the European average and, at retail level, they are reported to be US$ 6.25 for sea bass and US$ 6.00 for sea bream. Until a few years ago internal demand was low; consequently the interest of fishermen was also limited. Given the consequential under-exploitation of stocks in open seas or lagoons, it can be predicted that production could readily expand in the near future.
Even though prices are higher, production in Cyprus is reported to be following the same pattern as in Turkey. Current retail market prices for sea bass and sea bream were about US$ 12.48/kg in 1986. Demand for sea bass began only when wholesale prices were listed on the market.
Participants agreed that expansion of sea bass and sea bream production in the Mediterranean, either for internal consumption or for export markets, was feasible. Given that sea bass and sea bream final consumption patterns show different absorption capacities, and that they are a small share of each country's total fish consumption, participants agreed that production expansion should be smooth to avoid heavy falls or fluctuations in prices which could result in negative effects on both aquaculture production and fishermen's incomes.
2.2 Eel
In the southern Mediterranean rim countries there is little eel consumption. With the exception of Egypt, where about 500 tons of eel are consumed, these countries export the major part of their eel production to Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, where markets are stabilized and well structured.
In many countries the main concern is for elver production and trade. In addition to the trade of elvers for restocking and grow-out in fish farms, there is evidence of elvers being utilized as fresh food in some regions, e.g., Italy and Morocco. Because of the shortage of juvenile eels many countries are now showing concern and some, e.g. Turkey, have forbidden the catch and sale of elvers. As a result of the shortage prices have increased steadily. French production is reported to be about 500 t per year. Despite the normal price of F.F. 200/kg (US$ 30.4) during 1986, the market price in December reached F.F. 350/kg (US$ 53.2).
2.3 Mullets
Mullet production is widespread in the Mediterranean area. Consumers accept the product almost everywhere. Because of the relatively low value of these species there is little evidence of trade. Greece is among the few countries which is currently reported to import mullet from France and Turkey. Turkish consumers do not show any specific interest in these species. Tunisia produces about 1 800 t of mullets; all are consumed domestically. Demand for large size mullets has increased during recent years because of the production of 'bottarga' which is made from mullet eggs.

3. ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL PRODUCTION OF PRIME SPECIES
Participants gave their estimates of current national production of market-sized fish and their expectations for growth in the sector. This information is summarised in Tables 3 and 4. Details of the information presented verbally at the workshop are given in Annex 1.
Partial or complete estimates of current and projected aquaculture production were obtained for 11 countries - Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia. It is emphasized that the data given in Tables 3 and 4 are the combined estimates of those participating and are not intended to stand as official statistics.
Amongst the countries represented, only Egypt, Italy and Tunisia expected to increase the production of mullets substantially through extensive aquaculture in the next five years. Aquaculture production of mullets in the region may rise by 85% from about 11 000 in 1985 to about 20 400 t in 1992, mainly because of a forecast rise of 7 000 t per year in Italian production. Egyptian production was expected to double and Tunisian production to quadruple.
Eel production was expected to grow by nearly 4 000 t per year to about 10 700 t per year between 1985 and 1992, representing an increase of about 58%.
A substantial increase in the production of sea bream and sea bass was forecast. Current production in the countries represented at the workshop was about 6 000 t per year. This is expected to increase to over 27 000 t per year by 1992, 4.5 times the level in 1985/6. Workshop participants therefore expected that more than 21 000 t per year extra sea bass/sea bream will be produced annually by 1992, compared with the current situation. Estimates (Table 5) of current total production (fisheries and aquaculture) of these species were incomplete, but a rough calculation based on the figures provided indicated that, assuming fisheries production stagnates, aquaculture may nearly double the current availability of sea bass and sea bream from the region within six years. One participant felt that these estimates were conservative. The marketing implications of this are discussed in section 4 of this report.

4. TRADE AND MARKETING OF PRIME AQUACULTURE SPECIES IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES
4.1 Future production and exports
4.2 Marketing development needs
4.1 Future production and exports
Estimates for future production of sea bass, sea bream, mullets and eels according to domestic or export destination, are presented in Table 6. These estimates, for the years 1987 and 1992, support a tentative assumption that the present production of sea bass and bream for export is about 40% of that marketed domestically. In five years time production for export may increase to about 80% of that destined for domestic consumption. Spain, Tunisia and Turkey could be the countries with the most significant increase in production for export. This increase in the availability of exportable quantities (in the order of 9 000-10 000 t per year), which would almost exclusively aim at the Italian market, would result in considerable pressure on present price levels and could lead to market collapse due to lack of coordination. It should be noted that the Italian production is expected to increase by about 4 300 t per year. Thus, available supplies on the Italian market could
increase from about 5 000 t in 1987 to 19 000 t in 1992.

The only country identified which exports mullet from (extensive) aquaculture production is Turkey. It is estimated that the amount exported will decrease from 2 900 t (1987) to 2 600 t (1992). The workshop participants expect a doubling in cultured mullet for domestic markets, mostly due to anticipated substantial increases in Italian production, but no particular marketing problems are foreseen, at least not on an international scale.
The production increase of cultured eel for domestic markets is rather modest, except in Italy, where an increase of 1 000 t per year was forecast between 1987 and 1992. Total increase expected in all other countries is only 235 t per year. Production of eel for export on the other hand, is expected to experience a more pronounced growth of about 2 400 t, an increase of about 75% above present eel production for export. Italy, Greece, Egypt, Portugal and Tunisia are the countries principally responsible for these additional quantities becoming available for the markets in the Netherlands and Federal Republic of Germany. The group agreed that these markets should be able to absorb these additional quantities but it would be desirable to watch market developments closely, in particular competing production.
In summary, the consensus was that no marketing or trade problems were to be expected with mullet; that Mediterranean producers should monitor developments in export markets for eel, and that marketing and trade could become critical for the future viability of sea bass and sea bream culture.
4.2 Marketing development needs
The markets for eel show very specific product requirements. The opinion was expressed that, in the future, consumption of smoked eel may increase at the expense of fresh consumption, but total demand for eel may not grow as fast as production. Market developments should therefore be monitored, particularly in Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands. The feasibility of promoting preserved eel products (smoked, marinated) should be investigated if necessary.
There was considerable discussion regarding market expectations for sea bass and sea bream. Reference was made to salmon particularly as a demonstration of the potential advantages of duly recognizing marketing requirements, and of the dangers of marketing sea bass and sea bream in an erratic and uncoordinated way. Examples of price falls for sea bream of 50%, due to a minor over-supply and the market situation for fresh Norwegian farmed salmon in Paris in November 1986, were noted. It was strongly advocated that every effort should be made to push farmed sea bream into the present primary position of salmon in the expensive restaurant trade. The idea behind this is the promotion of a typically Mediterranean product, which carries the positive associations of summer and recreation, and which is already appreciated in Italy and France. Table 7 gives a summary of survey results referring to servings of fish dishes in 70 high class restaurants on the French Mediterranean coast,
and showed that choice of sea bass increases with increased menu price (as do salmon and sole but to a lesser extent).

In addition the large number of product markets and prices, related to the variations between sea bream varieties of different geographical origin, was mentioned as making the market (which actually consisted of a number of small markets) rigid and inflexible. However, there were also examples of hitherto unknown species such as Argentinian besugo replacing sea bream (at US$ 8.00-9.00/kg, airfreighted fresh on ice from Mar del Plata to Milan), possibly at a level of 15 t per month.
The requirements of the supermarket trade in respect of uniformity of sizes and standardization of packs were highlighted as well as the advantage of portion size compared with off-sized and over-sized fish for the restaurant trade.

5. INTERMEDIARY GOODS AND SERVICES AS PART OF INVESTMENT IN AQUACULTURE - ANALYSIS AND TRENDS IN PRODUCTION COSTS
5.1 Feeds
5.2 Fry
5.3 Other aspects
The role played by intermediary goods and services in terms of strengthening and developing the aquaculture industry was recognized by all the participants. Discussion of this topic concentrated on sea bass and sea bream farming. All participants felt that much of the fish farmers' and researchers' concern should be directed toward two main areas:
- the development of proper diets which would improve food conversion efficiency and decrease the incidence of diseases which are prevalent on grow-out farms and hatcheries;
- technological developments to increase the survival rate of hatchery reared sea bass and sea bream fingerlings.
All participants agreed that these two areas were the most important as together they represented about 55% of total production costs.
5.1 Feeds
Sea bass/bream feed prices were not quantified by type or quality but were reported to be US$ 1.06/kg for fry feed in Cyprus. Grow-out feeds were reported to be F.F. 5/kg (US$ 0.76) in France, US$ I/kg in Greece, Lit. 1 300/kg (US$ 0.93) in Italy, US$ 0.70/kg in Portugal and Pts. 135/kg (US$ 0.99) in Spain. Eel feed was stated to be US$ 0.70/kg in Portugal. Sea bass/bream feed represents only about one percent of total European fish feed sales. Currently about 1 500 t per year of sea bass/bream feeds, all sold in the Mediterranean, are produced by the one manufacturer present. This was said to be about 50% of the total market for these products.
A comparison of the benefits of dry and wet feeds was proposed by one representative. Even though more expensive, dry feed has shown to be easier to handle, easier to automate, more consistent in quality, and produces better growth. On the other hand, wet feed is cheaper and can be prepared on site; but labour utilization is greater, there being many difficulties in handling, automatic feeding and consistency. Most participants showed greater preference for the utilization of dry feed, especially in intensive fish farming. Feed quality was recognized as the most important requisite for good fish production.
Feed costs as a proportion of total production costs on grow-out farms varies from 27 to 33% (Table 8). One participant noted that this percentage is still low when compared with the salmon and chicken farming industries where feed costs are as high as 45-55% and 60-65% of total production costs respectively.
Even though improvements in feed quality are foreseen, it was generally thought that decreases in unit costs were unlikely.
5.2 Fry
In Cyprus there are two sea bass/bream hatcheries, mainly oriented towards an export market. The capacity of these hatcheries is 2 million juveniles per year while current output is about 170 000 per year. There are at least 10 hatcheries in Italy which are estimated to produce a total of 6 million juveniles annually. France has five hatcheries, with a capacity of 6 million juveniles per year; about 1 million per year are produced now. In Greece only one hatchery is currently operational. Its current output equals its capacity at 1.8 million juveniles annually. Spain has four hatcheries with a capacity and current output of 6 million juveniles per year. Tunisia has two public hatcheries intended for research and one private hatchery about which no information was available. Hatchery production is not yet started in Portugal or Turkey. It is thought there is little opportunity for the development of 'backyard' hatcheries for sea bass and sea bream, particularly because of the
need to maintain large brood fish.
Mullet fry were reported to be priced, according to species and seasonality, from Lit. 30 to 130 (US$ 0.02-0.09) each in Italy^1 in 1986. Elvers were reported to cost US$ 26-30/kg in France, rising to US$ 46 in December, while they were US$ 62/kg in Portugal and US$ 25-36/kg in Italy.^1
^1 S. Cataudella (pers.comm.)
Hatchery-reared sea bass juveniles were reported to be F.F. 3.5-5.9 (US$ 0.53-0.90) each in France according to size, while sea bream were F.F. 4.6-7.6 (US$ 0.70-1.15) each. Prices in Cyprus were reported to be US$ 0.60 each locally or US$ 0.65 for export. In Greece hatchery-reared juveniles were Gr.Dr. 80 (US$ 0.57) each for bass and Gr.Dr. 100 (US$ 0.71) each for bream. In Portugal sea bass juveniles collected from the wild were US$ 0.35 each. Hatchery-reared sea bass and sea bream juveniles in Spain were Pts. 80 (US$ 0.59) and 100 (US$ 0.74) each respectively in 1986. In Italy fry cost up to Lit. 1 200 (US$ 0.86) each depending on size.

All participants showed great concern about the need to increase the current Mediterranean production of sea bass and sea bream juveniles. In fact, since each country represented in the workshop plans many aquaculture investment programmes for the production of these two species, shortages of juveniles could become one of the greatest bottlenecks in further development. This imbalance between demand and supply, which is already being experienced, could result in unreasonably high juvenile prices and limit the potential production capacity of individual fish farms. Participants felt that shortage of juveniles could cause unpredictable effects for Mediterranean producers in economic and productive terms. Wild fry were said to be abundant only in Portugal and Turkey which have not yet experienced intensive fish farming.
Juvenile costs as a proportion of total grow-out costs vary from 23 to 29% (Table 8). Some participants stated that profit margins on hatchery-reared sea bass and sea bream juveniles are as high as 25-28%. It follows that increases in supply and improvements in technology, which could lower the mortality rate, may result in a lower international price for juveniles.
5.3 Other aspects
While biological improvements made life easier for fish farmers, participants believed that developments in other areas were not taking place in parallel. Anaesthetics and other chemicals required before and after fish handling, automatic feeders with spreaders to avoid feed wastage, and technical improvements related to cage construction, were given as examples of topics requiring priority attention.
A major concern of participants were the difficulties encountered by private investors in obtaining rights over areas where fish farms could be established. Producers present at the workshop also stressed the difficulties encountered in getting the necessary public services such as licences, energy, telephones, telex, etc. Fish farms are almost always isolated from the community.
The workshop believed that solutions to the problems and difficulties discussed would lower production costs and make intensive fish farming less vulnerable to falls in product value. Production costs of three cage farming units were presented. Two farms were in Greece and the third was located near Trieste, Italy (Table 8). The figures presented revealed that production technology has reached a substantial homogenity. Differences in cost breakdown were attributed to specific management variants. One of the Greek farms and the Italian farm produce their own juveniles while the other Greek farm is still at an experimental stage. However, total feed and seed costs varied only between 53 to 57% of total production costs.
Subsequent discussion was then concentrated on the possibility of reducing margins 15-20% to meet a decreasing trend in market prices. Prices may drop due to the lower production costs of extensive farming systems; Mediterranean production from this source is expected to rise, resulting in greater competition for intensive farmers.
Average production costs and profit of a traditional 'valle' system of northern Italy were provided by one participant (Table 9) to provide an indication of the production costs of extensive aquaculture. Total production was estimated to be 100 kg/ha; about 50% was mullet, the remaining 50% being equally distributed between sea bass and sea bream.^1 Gross profit was estimated at nearly 20%.
^1 In 1983 official Greek statistics reported that, in Messologhi and Amvrakikos lagoons, production of sea bream was 49.2 and 41.2% of total catch respectively, while for sea bass it was 7.8 and 28% However, in other Greek lagoons there was a much lower percentage of high value species.
Investments in the ESAV^2 valli were anticipated to raise total productivity from the current 100 kg/ha to 300 kg/ha. These results would be achieved through integrated programmes which included more intensive culture systems for sea bass. Experiments on integrating clam and shrimp culture were also underway. It was noted that the results achieved by valliculture in northern Italy came from a region where this type of culture system is traditional, and where fish farmers have always invested to raise productivity.

However, bad weather and severe fluctuations in water temperature create many management difficulties and lower the economic profitability of valliculture in the area. Lagoons in southern Mediterranean regions could benefit from their more suitable weather conditions but probably need more capital investment to achieve efficient lagoon management.
An example was provided of the capital requirements needed to increase lagoon productivity. The information given was taken from a feasibility study of an integrated programme of intensive/extensive culture of the 100 ha Fusaro Lagoon, near Naples which was prepared in 1984 (Table 10). The project included public investments of US$ 2.3 million and private investments of a similar amount, resulting in a total capital investment of about US$ 46 000/ha. Total yield, considering public and private investments in a 30-year period, was 9.3%, while the cost/benefit ratio, at a 5% discount rate, was 1.56.
In subsequent discussions, many participants expressed their belief that intensive culture could cope with market price falls caused by increased production of sea bass and sea bream. Competitiveness could be achieved through decreases in costs mainly through reducing mortality rate in grow-out farms and hatcheries. Nevertheless margins cannot be expected to remain at current levels indefinitely. One participant predicted that margins would shrink in the future so that only those farms situated in the most suitable locations would be able to compete successfully.

Participants felt that a more detailed study of the comparative costs of the different culture systems was necessary. Only then would intensive fish farmers know what minimal cost levels could be achieved by government subsidized extensive culture. This would enable forecasts to be made of whether intensive farming of sea bass and sea bream would remain economically feasible in the long term.
A number of non-market related constraints to the further expansion of sea bass/sea bream farming were mentioned by participants. Not all technical problems were solved and there was still room for research on specific aspects. Constraints mentioned included:
- Disease problems which were expected to increase with intensification of farming systems
- Financing and insurance difficulties
- Site availability (in some countries)
- The need to improve grow-out technology in those countries with limited space for expansion using current methodology. This included applying 'open-sea cages' technology
- Legal problems
- Licensing difficulties
- The need for new hatcheries^1
- Limited availability of 'free' information on technology which was being maintained on a proprietary basis by the pioneers.
^1 It was stated that a total of 20 000 t per year would require 100 million fingerlings. Assuming an output of 2 million juveniles each this means there would need to be about 50 hatcheries to supply the demand; currently there are about 21 in the countries represented, with a maximum c.

6. THE FUTURE EXPANSION OF PRIME SPECIES IN AQUACULTURE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN - CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The workshop produced estimates of current aquaculture production for the prime species and estimates of output in five years' time. It also reviewed consumption characteristics and the nature of export and domestic markets for sea bass, sea bream, mullets and eel in the Mediterranean region. Participants reviewed trends in major production costs and the principal constraints to further development. In studying the potential for future expansion the workshop made a number of recommendations.
The results of the workshop are summarized as follows:
Production^1
1. Currently about 6 000 t per year of sea bass and sea bream, 11 000 t per year of mullets and nearly 7 000 t per year of eels are being produced by intensive and extensive aquaculture;
2. By 1992, eel production is expected to increase to nearly 11 000 t per year; mullet production is expected to almost double to 20 000 t per year;
3. Sea bass and sea bream production through aquaculture are forecast to rise by a factor of 4.5 to over 27 000 t per year.
^1 In the countries represented - Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey
Trade
1. About 29% of current aquaculture production of sea bass and sea bream is estimated to be destined for export markets. This proportion may rise to 45% by 1992. This represents a forecast increase in the availability of exportable quantities by 9 000 to 10 000 t per year between 1987 and 1992;
2. The forecast five year increase in mullet production is destined entirely for domestic markets;
3. The availability of cultured eel for export markets is expected to increase by a factor of 75% while that for domestic markets may rise (mainly through Italian expansion) by 33%;
4. No special marketing problems are foreseen for mullet, and the North European markets for eel are expected to be able to absorb the additional supply. However, it is cautioned that the eel market is more volatile and future events, particularly competition from producing countries outside the Mediterranean, should be closely monitored;
5. The anticipated increase in the export availability of sea bass and sea bream could result in considerable pressure on present price levels and could lead to market collapse. The increased production is almost exclusively aimed at tie Italian market.
Market
1. Eel markets have very specific product requirements. Smoked eel consumption may increase. The feasibility of promoting preserved eel products requires investigation;
2. Sea bass and sea bream prices are subject to severe fluctuations due to local gluts. Farmers are expected to become more susceptible to this as supply increases, unless production and marketing planning are coordinated more effectively;
3. Sea bream could be promoted as a typically Mediterranean product which could supplant the primary position of salmon in the restaurant market;
4. Preferences are noted for locally produced, rather than imported, sea bream in some markets.
Production Costs^1
1. Sea bass/sea bream grow-out dry feed unit costs were US$ 0.70-1.00/kg in 1986. Feeding costs range from 27 to 33% of total production costs. Unit costs are not expected to decrease but feed performance improvements are anticipated;
2. The cost of sea bass and sea bream fry is related to size. Extreme ranges from US$ 0.53 to 1.15 each are quoted for hatchery reared juveniles, while wild caught sea bass were available (in Portugal) at US$ 0.35 each. Sea bream fry are always more expensive than sea bass. Prices are expected to rise unless more hatcheries became operational. Juvenile costs represent 23 to 29% of total production costs;
3. Although some details of the costs of production through valliculture are provided, detailed comparisons with the costs of intensive production systems are not feasible during this workshop. However, intensive farmers should expect greater competition in the future from extensive producers whose capital costs may have been met or subsidized by governments, not necessarily for strictly commercial reasons.
^1 Discussion concentrated on sea bass and sea bream production costs
Constraints
The primary constraints, other than marketing difficulties, to the further expansion of intensive sea bass and sea bream farming are:
1. Disease problems in hatcheries and grow-out farms, which contribute to poor survival rates;
2. The need for further technical improvements, such as better automatic feeders and 'high-sea' cages;
3. Difficulties in obtaining legal rights over fish farming areas (e.g., cages) and the necessary public services, including licences and utilities;
4. The inflexibility of planning controls;
5. Potential competition from extensive aquaculture;
6. The shortage of suitable sites^1;
7. Financing and insurance difficulties;
8. Paucity of technical information, which tends to be proprietary;
9. Inadequate supply of juveniles. About 100 million fingerlings are required annually to support the 5-year production expansion foreseen;
^1 One participant believed that, in addition to the natural shortage of suitable sites, supermarket chains might acquire sites and hold them until technology becomes available which enables reductions of up to 50% in production costs.
As a result of the information gathered at the workshop and the discussions which ensued, participants developed a number of informal recommendations. These are noted below:
Recommendations
1. A system should be instituted to monitor and report on research and development and its impact on production costs in hatcheries and grow-out units. This would provide an early warning of new sub-sector developments;
2. The production costs and potential scale of production systems of differing intensity should be studied, monitored and regularly reported;
3. An indicative planning document (providing guidance to investors on the likely course of development, identifying key investment points and constraints, such as a workable legal framework for farmers, working capital loan facilities, etc.) should be prepared;
4. A market information system, providing details of evolving product specifications, prices, quantities of fish entering the markets and other relevant data, should be established;
5. The requirements of the household consumer and the restaurant trade should be studied in detail and consequential demand promotion undertaken;
6. The feasibility of improving market conditions, through grower associations or marketing boards, by achieving year-round product availability at stable prices, should be investigated;
7. Improved handling and quality control, and the use of brand names and quality identification labels should be encouraged to promote demand for farmed, as opposed to captured, sea bass and sea bream;
8. Aquaculture should aim at domestic, not just export markets;
9. A pertinent marketing strategy, for the sea bass/sea bream culture industry, supported and modified by the continuing distribution of updated information on the topics noted above, needs development. The present markets for sea bass and sea bream are too narrow;
10. The accuracy of the estimates made at this workshop should be monitored (perhaps by further workshops). Future workshop participants should include bankers.^1
11. Despite the fact that the technology was rapidly evolving, basic, practical, technical manuals would be of particular value to the developing countries of the region;
12. FAO has an important role to play in carrying out the recommendations made at the workshop. Participants particularly felt that the work mentioned in recommendations 1,2,3,4,9,10 and 11 above could only be undertaken adequately by an international agency. Careful consideration of these aspects should be included in the preparation of a new Mediterranean (Euro-Arabic) regional aquaculture programme.
^1 Participants believed that the dialogue and research fostered by a workshop was of greater value than desk studies.

ANNEX 1 - Notes on the status of the culture and fisheries of prime species in the Mediterranean region
The following information was provided verbally by participants:
ALBANIA AND ALGERIA
No participant
CYPRUS
There is no aquaculture production of sea bass, sea bream, mullet or eels at present. However, there is one hatchery which is in its initial operation stages. There are severe limitations on the development of this type of aquaculture in Cyprus, including lack of space for grow-out (limited sites for cage culture and very expensive land) and a complicated licensing system for farmers. Despite this it was forecast that the production of sea bass and sea bream might reach 200 t per year by 1992.
EGYPT^1
^1 Due to communication problems the participant from Egypt did not receive his invitation, or the letter asking for information until just before he left Egypt. In addition, due to travel problems he was not present during the production session. However he promised to forward the requisite information by post; this had, unfortunately, not arrived at the time of going to press.
FRANCE
Although the official estimates of total production from all sources were 2 500 t per year of sea bass and less than 1 000 t per year of sea bream, it was believed that these were under-estimates. Participants estimated that 3 500 t per year and 1 500 t per year of sea bass and sea bream respectively were produced in 1986. Of the sea bass, 48% is caught by trawlers in the winter and 52% by small boats in the summer. More than 70% is exported to Italy. Aquaculture produced 150 t of sea bass (including 25 t in freshwater) and 25 t of sea bream in 1985.
The total catch of mullets was 5 000 t in 1986 of which 240 t came from culture. The official catch of eels, at 1 500 t, was thought to be an under-estimate; the participants' estimate was 1 700 t. Of this, 380 t was estimated to be produced by all forms of aquaculture.
Originally it was planned to produce 1 000 t per year of sea bass alone by aquaculture by 1995 but one of the French participants thought that this had now been reduced to 500 t per year of both sea bass and sea bream in less intensive polyculture systems because of pessimistic local views of market prospects and the high investment costs of intensive culture. No forecasts were given for increased mullet production by aquaculture and farmed eel production was not expected to rise.
Another of the French participants was more optimistic and stated that five new projects for sea bass and bream culture were starting now. If these succeeded he expected that up to 400 t per year of these two species would be produced by 1988. One sea bream farm alone (in Corsica) expects to produce a maximum of 100 t per year by 1988/9. There are five operational sea bass/bream hatcheries operating currently. Finally a maximum estimate for sea bass/bream production by 1992 of 1 000 t per year was agreed. No increase in mullet or eel production was forecast for 1992.
The major problems in France for sea bass and sea bream culture are that the Atlantic is too cold in winter. Thus culture can only be practised in the Mediterranean unless heated water is available. In the Mediterranean, sites were scarce due to competition, principally from activities associated with tourism. However, this constraint might be removed if technological improvements were made, notably the successful application of cages strong enough to withstand open sea conditions.
GREECE
The intensive aquaculture production of sea bass/bream was zero in 1984 and about 5 - 6 tons in 1985 (50% each species). In 1986, 22 t of sea bream and 10 t of sea bass were produced. The cultured production of sea bream was expected to rise to 270 t in 1987, 350 t in 1988 and more than 500 t in 1989. Sea bass production was expected to rise to 80 t in 1987, 100 t in 1988 and 150-160 t in 1989. Currently one hatchery was operational but, by 1989, there may be two additional private hatcheries and one public facility. If the other three hatcheries become operational, total sea bass/bream production in Greece could rise to more than 1 000 t per year by 1990. The participant from Norway felt that this was an underestimate. Potential production need not rely solely on locally produced juveniles. Juvenile imports from Cyprus and Turkey may bring Greek sea bass/bream production to 2 000 t per year by 1990.
In addition to the quantities of sea bass/bream which were estimated to have been produced by intensive aquaculture, 400 t were produced by extensive systems in 1985 while 1 400 t of mullet and 900-1 000 t of eels were also produced. Lagoon productivity averaged 72 kg/ha/year and plans exist to raise this to 100 kg/ha/year by 1991. By this time a further 250-300 t per year of eels from intensive production was anticipated.
Total aquaculture production in Greece by 1991 was therefore expected to total about 2 500 t of sea bass and sea bream, 1 900 t of mullets and
ISRAEL
No participant
ITALY^1
^1 Two of the major participants from the private sector, who had been invited, were finally unable to come. Estimates of Italian production were given by the workshop coordinator, assisted by ESAV contributions.
It was estimated that the total production of sea bass and sea bream totalled 2 700 t 1985, while mullet production was 2 000 t. 1 500 t of eels were produced from valli culture and another 2 500 t per year by intensive culture, totalling 4 000 t.
Aquaculture production of sea bass and sea bream is expected to more than double within 5 years to 7 000 t per year; similarly mullet production is expected to rise to 9 000 t per year due to increases in the productivity of valli culture. Eel production is expected to rise to 6 000 t per year by 1990.
Valli culture earns other revenues besides fish sales. ESAV stated that in one Veneto valli, 60% of income came from fisheries and 40% from hunting. Integrated intensive/extensive aquaculture is expected to raise productivity in some vallis to 300 kg/ha.
LEBANON AND LIBYA
No participant
MALTA
No participant but it was said that there is no aquaculture production there yet.
MOROCCO
No representative was present from Morocco. However, another participant stated that a new venture there could be producing 1 000 t per year of sea bass/bream by 1988. Morocco is said to be self-sufficient in marine products (Berger, et al., 1985), so future production will be oriented at export markets, especially the Spanish market for sea bass and sea bream.
PORTUGAL
Aquaculture is still in the artisanal phase in Portugal but rapid changes are expected.
Official estimates were that 84 t of sea bass would be produced in 1986, together with 168 t of gilthead sea bream, 238 t of eels and 419 t of mullets (all from natural stocking). Official forecasts for 1992 were 500 t of mullets, 450 t of eels, 200 t of sea bass and 150 t of gilthead sea bream. The participant from Portugal believed that these were underestimates, stating that he alone had a farm producing 25 t of sea bass and 80 t of gilthead sea bream. There was no cage culture yet in Portugal and no hatchery. The participant from the Netherlands stated that there were two intensive eel farms in Portugal, each producing 35 t per year. Total current eel production must therefore be at least 308 t per year. Tank production of eels could rise to 150 t per year by 1988, bringing the total estimate to at least 600 t per year by 1992. The participant from Portugal stated that total sea bass/bream production might rise to 1 000 t per year by 1992.
SPAIN
Of the total production of 878 t of sea bream in 1985, 30 t was produced from two aquaculture enterprises. Aquaculture production of sea bream was expected to be 50 t in 1986, 100 t in 1987 and 250 t in 1988.
In 1985, 521 t of sea bass were produced, of which 10-15 t came from aquaculture (there were four producers who operated this as an ancillary activity). No estimates for the future were given as it was thought that Spanish producers would concentrate on sea bream; sea bass farming required greater investment. There are four sea bream/bass hatcheries in Spain at present.
Mullets are consumed only in the areas where they are fished. About 1 000 t were estimated to have been caught in 1985, none from culture. The official eel catch in 1985 was 59 t but the Spanish participant felt that this was an underestimate and it could have been as much as 700 t. Only about 5 t were produced through intensive aquaculture, as eels are not well favoured in Spain.
There are estimated to be 20 000 ha available for the aquaculture of sea bass/bream in Spain. Total production could be as high as 3 500 t per year by 1992. No increase in eel production was forecast.
It was stated that there was an ambitious venture in the Canaries, in addition to those in mainland Spain, which could contribute 100 t of sea bass/bream in 1987 and 1 000 t in 1992.
SYRIA
No participant. According to Berger et al., (1985) there is no coastal aquaculture production in Syria.
TUNISIA
See Annex 2.
TURKEY
1982 production statistics were 605 t of sea bream, 230 t of sea bass, 4 589 t of mullet and 445 t of eels, all from lagoon culture. Total catch in 1985 from all sources was stated to be 1 553 t sea bass, 710 t sea bream, 2 748 t of mullet and 583 t of eels. The Norwegian participant stated that there was also cage production in Turkey which was expected to contribute 100 t per year of sea bass/bream in 1987 and 300-400 t per year in 1988. There are, as yet, no sea bass/bream hatcheries in Turkey.
Forecast production in 1987 was 2 200 t of sea bass and sea bream, rising to 3 000 t by 1992. Mullet production has fallen since 1982 (see text, Table 5) and was expected to be 3 500 t per year in 1987, remaining static (3 600 t per year) to 1992. Eel production, although it has risen a little since 1982, was also expected to remain fairly static (580 t in 1987; 600 t in 1992).
YUGOSLAVIA
The participant from Yugoslavia was unable to attend but others estimated Chat sea bass aquaculture production was currently 70-140 t per year and could rise to 500 t per year by 1992.

ANNEX 2 - Extracts from the written contributions of participants
Written contributions were received from some participants (see also Annex 3). Where these were relevant to the specific topic of the workshop, excerpts have been provided in this annex:
CYPRUS
Sea bream only accounted for 0.64 tons of the 1984 landings of 2 206 tons. The catch of mullets was 8.2 tons. Sea bass landings were not recorded but small quantities were on the market. Fish imports were 2 696 t of fishery products but only 141 t was fresh or chilled whole fish. Total per caput consumption in 1984 was 3.8 kg per year.
Category 'A' fish, which include large sea bream and mullet are US$ 14.1/kg wholesale, US$ 18.7/kg retail. Category 'B' fish, which include sea bass and small sea bream fetch US$ 9.4/kg wholesale and US$ 12.5/kg retail. Grey mullet command US$ 7.8/kg wholesale and US$ 10.9/kg retail.
There are only two commercial on-shore intensive tank farms to date. There is a commercial hatchery which started operations in early 1986. A few sea bream are retained for its own small grow-out unit but most juveniles are exported. This unit expects to expand to meet export demand and to continue to serve as a research and development/demonstration unit for its parent (UK consultancy) company. A government hatchery was under construction and was expected to be operational by late 1987. One other grow-out unit was tentatively planned.
FRANCE
It was estimated that the 1985 consumption of sea bass and sea bream was 2 000 t and 800 t respectively. 5 000 t of mullets and 1 500 t of eels were also consumed. Of these only 26 t of bass was imported. Mean national prices were F.F. 65-80/kg (US$ 9.9-12.2) for bass, F.F. 70/kg (US$ 10.6) for bream, F.F. 18/kg (US$ 2.7) for black mullet, (F.F. 7/kg (US$ 1.1) for white mullet), and F.F. 42/kg (US$ 6.4) for eels. Maximum prices of F.F. 90/kg (US$ 13.7) were achieved for both bass and bream in the Mediterranean area. Bass and bream were exported to Italy. Real tonnage was difficult to estimate because many sales were directed to restaurants and retailers or were included with other species in official statistics.
Aquaculture products were sold direct to restaurants and were directly exported by the producers as well as being sold to wholesalers. Fishery products invariably passed through wholesalers.
Production estimates of the four species from aquaculture have been presented in the report text (Table 3), while information on feed and fry costs is given in section 5. Sea bass and sea bream were produced by extensive (lagoons), semi-intensive (ponds) and intensive (tanks and cages) techniques. An average of 20 kg/m^3 was being achieved in cages; 120 t were produced by intensive techniques in 1985. Most mullet and eel culture was extensive, though 10 t per year of eel were produced intensively in one farm and another unit was starting production. Productivity ranged from 40-50 kg/ha/year in extensive systems to 100-150 kg/ha/year in semi-intensive ponds. Up to 40 kg/m^3 had been achieved in pump exchanged tanks and in cages.
Increased supply from aquaculture was expected to reduce sale value and farmers would need to reduce costs and increase demand through promotional activities.
One French delegate presented the results of a recent menu survey of 70 restaurants in the Cte d'Azur which showed a link between consumer preference and the total menu cost. At higher menu prices more people selected sea bass and less selected gilthead sea bream. In both cases sea bass was the most favoured species amongst a range of species including salmon, sole and turbot. Sea bass caught by line have a higher value than pelagic fish caught by drag net. Cultured sea bass were usually sold as line caught fish and valued as such.
GREECE
The total output of fish in Greece in 1985 was 134 000 t of which 79.5% was fresh fish, 13.3% frozen fish, 5.6% mariculture products and 1.6% freshwater fish culture production. Domestic production covered only 70-75% of total consumption. The tonnage of aquaculture products was steady from 1983-85. Average fresh fish prices rose 24% in 1985 over 1984.
Most eel aquaculture production was extensive; the sole intensive unit produced 4 t in 1984 compared with a total production of 776 t of which 737 t were exported, mainly to West Germany, Denmark, Holland, Italy and Ireland.
Extensive farming of marine species had a very low productivity due to lack of infrastructure, poor technology and poor management. There were about 10 intensive (cage) production units and one hatchery, the latter integrated with a grow-out unit. All the other production units suffered from a shortage of fry (two state hatcheries are being planned). Maximum cage productivity was about 20 kg/m^3 and a food conversion ratio of 2.5:1 was being achieved. Average on-growing time for sea bass and sea bream was 15 months. The average bream and bass price sold to supermarkets and restaurants was Gr.Dr. 1 600/kg (US$ 11.4). About 10 t of sea bass was exported to Italy in 1986.
ITALY
Per caput fish consumption in 1983 was 12.5 kg per year, fourth highest in the Mediterranean region after Spain, France and Greece. In that year it was a net importer of 190 000 t of fish. In 1983 (Berger, et al., 1985) the total consumption of sea bass and bream was 2 740 t (1 780 t bass and 960 t bream). Of these totals, 51% of bass and 12% of bream was imported.
In 1986 sea bass and large sea bream in the Venice fish market were about Lit. 25 000/kg (US$ 17.9). Small sea bream and 300-1 000 g eels were smaller eels (7-8/kg) were about Lit. 8 000/kg (US$ 5.7). Over the 2^1/[2] years from January 1984 the wholesale value of small sea bream had fallen. Prices of eels had been steady. The general price trend for large sea bream and for sea bass had been upwards.
Semi-intensive eel culture, dating from the seventies, was producing 2 500-3 000 t per year by 1986. The availability of elvers was an increasing constraint.
PORTUGAL
Although the total catch increased from 223 486 t in 1983 to 273 681 t in 1985 (40% sardines) the fall from the peaks of around 415 000 t during the early sixties was still evident.
Extensive polyculture systems existed in tidal extensive areas, stocked with wild fry. Most were associated with or converted from salt production units. Only two of the five intensive eel farms set up were still functioning. Productivity in extensive culture was 100-150 kg/ha/y in the north. In the central areas and the south it was 150-300 kg/ha/y and 300-500 kg/ha/y respectively, both with supplementary re-stocking. Wild juveniles cost US$ 0.35 each; there were no hatcheries. In all cases mullets were the dominant extensive species. Eels were the second most prominent species except in the south where they were replaced by gilthead sea bream. In all areas, sea bass were the third most prominent species produced.
A total of over 28 000 ha was suitable for coastal aquaculture; 18% was used for salt production. By 1986, with access to EEC funds, about 3 000 ha had already been devoted to aquaculture. So far expansion had been in extensive systems. However, a commercial sea bass/bream/sole hatchery was expected to be operational by the end of 1987 and two firms aimed to start semi-intensive sea bass/sea bream grow-out operations, projecting 10 t/ha/y.
SPAIN
Fish per caput consumption had risen to 37 kg per year, total consumption being 1 480 000 t. Spain, traditionally an exporter, has been an importer of fish since 1977/8. In 1985 the export/import deficit was 218 t in the case of fresh and live eels and 219 t in the case of sea bream (dorades). Total deficit was 2 210 t.
The principal zones in the south of Spain with aquaculture potential were Cadiz and Huelva, with a total availability of 20 000 ha. Cadiz had 7 000 ha of salinas. A productivity of up to 4 kg/m^2 had been achieved in converted salinas with an average depth of 1 m and water replenishment by pump as well as tidally.
Total landings in 1985 of sea bream, sea bass and eels (from the sea) were 878 t, 521 t and 59 t respectively. Medium prices were Pts. 564/kg (US$ 4.2) for sea bream, Pts. 1 176/kg (US$ 8.7) for sea bass and Pts. 505/kg (US$ 3.7) for eels.
TUNISIA
Total production of sea bass from all sources in 1986 was estimated to be 370 t. 300 t came from coastal and other fisheries, 40 t from lagoon fisheries and 30 t from aquaculture. The total production of sea bream was also 370 t. Of this 20 t came from aquaculture, 50 t from lagoon fisheries and 300 t from coastal and other fisheries. Only 10 t of mullets were produced by intensive aquaculture, while 250 t came from lagoons and 1 500 t from coastal and other fisheries. No eels were produced by intensive aquaculture but 70 t out of a total of 120 t came from lagoons.
Total exports (from all production sources) in 1986 were 60 t each of sea bass and sea bream and 110 t of eels. No mullets were exported.
In 1986 local wholesale price ranges were US$ 6.3-10.0/kg for sea bass, US$ 4.5-8.0/kg for sea bream, US$ 2.0-5.0/kg for mullets and US$ 2.0-3.0/kg for eels. Export price ranges were US$ 8.0-9.5/kg for sea bass, US$ 5.0-6.0/kg for sea bream and US$ 3.0-3.5/kg for eels.
There was one large-scale commercial aquaculture unit in 1986; two more will commence operations in 1987 and five others were in the technical/economic study phase. In addition, 150 family projects were expected to commence within the next 5 years. Currently the commercial farm imported fry from France but there were three hatcheries and five more in various stages of development.
TURKEY
Per caput fish consumption averaged 10.6 kg per year currently and was greatest in the coastal areas. Consumption, oriented towards fresh fish, rose in the summer; distribution channels were therefore important. Of the prime species, sea bream was the favourite, followed by sea bass and mullet. Eels were almost never consumed, due to religious embargos.
Until 1986, Turkey was an exporter of fish. Fish importing was new but now imported bonito and lobsters, at high prices due to taxes and levies, were found in the market.
Aquaculture was novel in Turkey and enterprises generally small. Mariculture in particular was little known publicly. Fish farming was carried out by cooperatives, the products being marketed by fishmongers, who got the lion's share of profits. Entrepreneurs were interested in aquaculture, particularly carp culture, but fishermen were largely uneducated. Cage culture had been fruitful in increasing aquaculture production. Proper lagoon management systems were required to exploit the potential, as yet untapped. Trained staff for this activity were scarce.
Unskilled labour was plentiful and cheap. Feed was abundant and comparatively cheap. Wild fry were abundant on the Mediterranean coasts.
A barrier to further development was the lack of freezing facilities. Canning factories existed for tuna, anchovies and sardines but facilities for processing lagoon species were almost unknown.

ANNEX 3 - What can be learned from experience of the development of the Norwegian fish farming industry?
By
Bjrn Myrseth
The Norwegian fish farming industry has accelerated from zero to 80 km/h in 10 seconds. The first salmon was sold in 1971, and in 1986 we marketed 42 000 t of Atlantic salmon, making salmon the most single important fish in our fisheries (Annex 3, Table 1). There is much to be learned from our experience, which will help to avoid problems in other countries wanting to develop a fish farming industry.
What have we learnt? Some lessons are noted below:
1. Capital requirements
It takes four years from when you start with a salmon egg until the life cycle is completed. Remember that you tie up capital for at least 3^1/[2] years if you are starting Atlantic salmon production. A similar story exists with other marine fish.
2. Pollution
It is very important to remember that cage farming of fish pollutes the environment but it only has a local effect. Good current and water circulation at the cages site are very important.
3. Feed
Good quality feed is important. To produce good quality feed high quality ingredients are essential. This means that feed will be costly.
The characteristics of dry feed are:
- easy handling
- good growth
- consistency
- easy automation of feeding
- high unit cost
Those of wet feed are:
- difficult handling
- prepared on sites, much work involved
- difficult to automate
- not consistent
- unit cost cheap
4. Disease
There will always be problems with diseases in fish farming, and we must always expect new ones to crop up as the industry expands.
To avoid diseases, good husbandry and good hygiene is very important. All this can only be achieved by training the fish farmer.
Government research and support always lag behind the needs of the industry to cope with disease problems.
There should be a minimum distance of at least 1 000 m between each farm. This distance has to be modified according to water flow and currents.
5. Technical improvement
Stronger cages have been developed, made of steel and high density polyethylene.
6. Economics
Government support in relation to working capital is extremely important. In Norway this has been provided in the form of guarantees so that a fish farmer can go to a local bank and borrow the working capital necessary.
The size of a fish farm should not be limited by political decisions, but by the economy of scale. In some cases I am convinced that small family owned and operated farms could be the most successful. However, with other species and under other conditions, farms may have to be run by larger corporations to achieve economy of scale.
7. Training
Schools and universities seem too slow to realize that there is a demand for trained fish farming technicians and personnel. They are therefore too late in starting training programmes.
8. Legal constraints
It is important that each country realizes its potential in aquaculture. Laws must be established which regulate the industry, set rules for what the fish farmer can do and not do, and draw lines between traditional fisheries and aquaculture. In most countries this has not yet been done, and this makes fish farming permits difficult to obtain.
9. Quality control
Right from the beginning, fish farmers should introduce some kind of quality control to distinguish farm fish, which can be sold at high quality because it is fresh. It must be distinguished from old captured or frozen fish.
10. Supply of juveniles
It is very important that all governments support the construction and running of hatcheries first before too much money is put into cage culture. We should keep in mind the production line, which is broodfish -eggs - juveniles - market size fish.
It is most likely that the supply of broodfish, eggs, and (most important of all) juveniles, will be bottlenecks in the production chain. This imbalance has to be straightened out to avoid unreasonably high prices for juveniles and the frustration experienced by fish farmers who, having got cages and permits and everything else ready, cannot fill the cages with juvenile fish. This very often ends up with farmers stocking uneconomically small fry sizes because there are not enough juveniles.
In summary: get the infrastructure right. I hope I have pinpointed a number of the constraints that would limit the growth of Mediterranean fish farming. Be aware of them and try to straighten them out before they appear.

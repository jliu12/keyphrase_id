Introduction
The Monographs on the residues of the nine compounds contained in this volume were prepared by the forty-eight meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which was held in Geneva, 18-27 February 1997. JECFA has evaluated veterinary drugs at previous meetings, including the 12th^1, 26th^2, 27th^3, 32nd^4, 34th^5, 36th^6, 38th^7, 40th^8, 42nd^9, 43rd^10, 45th^11 and 47th^12 meetings.
In response to a growing concern about mass-medication of food producing animals and the implications for human health and international trade, a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Residues of Veterinary Drugs was convened in Rome, in November 1984^13. Among the main recommendations of this consultation were the establishment of a specialized Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) and the periodic convening of an appropriate body to provide independent scientific advice to this Committee and to the member countries of FAO and WHO. At its first session in Washington D.C. in November 1986, the newly-created CCRVDF reaffirmed the need for such a scientific body and made a number of recommendations and suggestions to be considered by JECFA^14. In response to these recommendations, the thirty-second JECFA meeting was entirely devoted to the evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in foods. Subsequently, the 34th, 36th, 38th, 40th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th,
47th and 48th meetings of JECFA were also dedicated exclusively to evaluation of veterinary drugs.
The tenth session of the CCRVDF, held in San Jose, Costa Rica, during October-November 1996, revised the priority list of veterinary drugs requiring evaluation. The drugs evaluated during the 48th meeting of JECFA included these compounds, except gentamicin, the evaluation of which was postponed to the 50th meeting of the Expert Committee, scheduled to be held in Rome in February 1998.
The present volume contains summary monographs of the residue data on nine of the eleven compounds on the agenda. The anthelminthic agent, moxidectin had been considered before by the 45th meeting of JECFA.
From the six antimicrobial agents, ceftiofur had previously been evaluated by the Committee at the 45th, dihydrostreptomycin and streptomycin at the 43rd, and spiramycin at the 47th meeting. The remaining antimicrobial agents, danofloxacin and flumequine had not been evaluated before.
The insecticides, cyfluthrin and fluazuron, had not been considered before.
The pertinent information in each monograph was discussed and appraised by the entire Committee. The monographs are presented in a uniform format covering identity, residues in food and their evaluation, metabolism studies, tissue residue depletion studies, methods of residue analysis and a final appraisal of the study results. More recent publications and documents are referenced, including those on which the monograph is based. A summary of the JECFA evaluations from the 32nd to the present 48th meeting is included in Annex 1.
The assistance of the experts and FAO consultant in preparing these monographs is gratefully acknowledged.

RESIDUES IN FOOD AND THEIR EVALUATION
CONDITIONS OF USE
General
Ceftiofur hydrochloride is a broad spectrum cephalosporin which is formulated as a sterile suspension for administration by injection. The formulation is ready for use and contains 50 mg ceftiofur equivalents/mL. The product is similar in intended use to the sodium salt which was previously reviewed at the 45th meeting of the Committee in 1995.
Dosage
The typical maximum dosage is 2.2 mg/kg BW on 5 successive days in cattle and 3 mg/kg on 3 successive days in swine. Higher dosages have been tested.
METABOLISM AND PHARMACOKINETICS
Cattle
Six calves (average BW 376 kg at slaughter) each received 2.2 mg ceftiofur free acid equivalents (CFAE)/kg BW by intramuscular injection (IM) of ^14C-ceftiofur hydrochloride on 5 successive days (Johnson et al, 1987). Blood samples were collected and analyzed after each treatment. Maximum ceftiofur residues of 2.56 to 6.39 mg/L were found in blood samples collected at 2 to 4 hours post-treatment, declining to 0.42 to 1.46 mg/L 24 hours after each treatment. Depletion curves showed a small bioaccumulation effect and had an area under the curve (AUC) similar to that observed for ceftiofur sodium, indicating bioequivalence for the two salts. Average excretion at 12-hour withdrawal was 78.9 ± 5.3%. The amount excreted in the urine was approximately three times that found in feces, again similar to observations with ceftiofur sodium. All animals were slaughtered at 12-hour withdrawal and assayed for total residues. Average residues found were: kidney, 4.89 ± 1.62 mg/kg; liver,
1.41 ± 0.47 mg/kg; muscle, 0.19 ± 0.05 mg/kg; and fat, 0.86 ± 0.30 mg/kg. The tissue residue results are similar to those previously reviewed for ceftiofur sodium.
A study was also presented in which six cattle (3 male, 3 female) received an average daily dose of 2.45 mg/kg BW per day on 5 successive days, administered by intramuscular injection of ^14C-ceftiofur hydrochloride (Beconi-Barker et al., 1996). In total, 88.9% of the administered drug was accounted for, with 55.2% excreted in urine and 31.1% in feces. Highest residue concentrations (29.9 ± 12.9 mg/kg) were found in the injection sites for the final injection, which was administered 12 hours prior to slaughter. Data on urine and plasma metabolite profiles were collected in this study, but were not available at the time of preparation of this report. Residue results are discussed in the next section.
TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
Radiolabeled Residue Depletion Studies
Cattle
Six cattle (3 male, 3 female) each received an average IM dose of 2.45 mg CFAE/kg BW, administered as ^14C-ceftiofur hydrochloride on 5 successive days, and were slaughtered at 12 hours after the final injection (Beconi-Barker et al, 1996). In females, average total residues measured as total radioactivity found in edible tissues at slaughter were: kidney, 7.91 mg/kg; liver, 1.60 mg/kg; muscle, 0.28 mg/kg; and fat, 0.42 mg/kg. In males, average residues in edible tissues collected at slaughter were: kidney, 6.82 mg/kg; liver, 1.43 mg/kg; muscle, 0.21 mg/kg; and fat, 0.40 mg/kg. Average residues in injection sites in females varied from 35.41 ± 12.03 mg/kg in the day 5 site to 0.85 ± 0.22 mg/kg in the day 1 injection site, while in males the equivalent findings were 24.45 ± 13.54 for day 5 and 1.97 ± 0.88 mg/kg for day 1. The dose administered is approximately 11% in excess of the recommended dose of 2.2 mg/kg BW, so residues are slightly elevated above those expected at the
label dose. Residue concentrations reported in this study are total residues, not marker residue determined as desfuroylceftiofur (DFC).
The tissues assayed for total residues of ^14C-ceftiofur were also assayed for the marker residue, DFC, by HPLC (Beconi-Barker, 1996). The findings are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Comparison of total residues of ceftiofur, determined as ^14C-ceftiofur equivalents, with ceftiofur and metabolites containing an intact b -lactam ring, determined as desfuroylceftiofur by HPLC. Tissues were collected at sacrifice 12 hours after final treatment of cattle (n = 6) with 2.45 mg CFAE/kg BW (IM administration, treatments on 5 successive days).

Tissues collected from swine treated with ^14C-ceftiofur hydrochloride were analyzed for both total residues, based on the determination of total radioactivity, and intact b -lactam ring-containing residues, determined by HPLC as DFC (Beconi-Barker et al, 1995). In the first phase of the study, twelve swine (6 male, 6 female) were randomly divided into 3 sub-groups of 2 males and 2 females. Within each sub-group, 1 male and 1 female each received IM 5.0 mg CFAE/kg BW at 24-hour intervals on three successive days, while the remaining pair in each sub-group received 7.5 mg CFAE/kg BW, following the same treatment regimen. Animals were slaughtered 12 hours after administration of the last injection of ceftiofur and tissues were collected and analyzed. In the second phase of the study, 6 males and 6 females were randomly assigned to two sub-groups (3 males, 3 females per sub-group). All animals received IM 3.0 mg CFAE/kg BW on three successive days. One male and one female from
each sub-group were slaughtered at each of 12, 72 and 120 hours after the last injection with ceftiofur. Tissues were collected and analyzed. Results showing the total residues as determined by combustion and the marker residue as determined by HPLC are given in Table 2.

Cattle
Fourteen cattle (7 steers, 7 heifers, BW 305 to 455 kg) were used in a study in which 12 animals each received 2.2 mg/kg BW ceftiofur hydrochloride by subcutaneous (SC) injection on 5 successive days, with slaughter at 12 hours after the final treatment (Brown et al, 1995). Two animals served as controls. Edible tissues were assayed for ceftiofur and metabolites with an intact b -lactam ring as desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DFC) by HPLC. Residues were also determined in kidneys using an analytical procedure that isolates the bound residues, then liberates them for analysis as DFC by HPLC. Residues found were as follows: kidney (total marker as DFC), 4.06 ± 0.61 mg/kg; kidney (bound residue as DFC), 1.49 ± 0.36 mg/kg; liver, 0.99 ± 0.25 mg/kg; and muscle, 0.20 ± 0.04 mg/kg.
A study was also reported in which 30 male animals per location were treated with ceftiofur sodium at each of two test locations (Ibayashi et al, 1996a). At each location, the animals were divided into two groups of 15, with one group receiving 5 daily IM treatments of 2.0 mg CFAE/kg BW and the second group receiving 4.0 mg CFAE/kg BW according to the same regimen. Sub-groups of 3 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered at 1, 3, 15, 20 and 25 days after the last injection. Tissue samples were collected at slaughter and analyzed by HPLC, the results of which are given in Table 3 for samples collected at 1 to 15 days withdrawal. No detectable residues were found in any samples collected at 20 or 25 days. Highest residues were in kidneys at day 1, but at days 3 and 15 residues were higher in liver than in kidney. Significant residues were found in injection sites at day 1, but residues rapidly depleted over the subsequent sampling dates.

Swine
Studies were conducted with ceftiofur sodium at two different geographical locations using 30 castrated swine at each site (BW 22.6 to 33.9 kg), with two treatment groups duplicated per site (Ibayashi et al, 1996b). At each site, 15 animals received 3.0 mg ceftiofur free acid equivalents (CFAE)/kg BW by IM injection on 3 successive days, while the remaining 15 animals received 6.0 mg CFAE/kg BW by IM injection on 3 successive days. Groups of, 3 animals were randomly selected for slaughter at 1, 3, 7, 10 and 15 days after the third injection. A control animal was also slaughtered on Day 1 in each treatment group. Samples of plasma, fat, muscle, kidney, small intestine, liver, injection site muscle and tissue surrounding the injection site were collected from each animal at slaughter. All samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography for the marker residue, desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DFC), which includes all remaining residues with an intact b -lactam ring. No residues
were detected in the control animals. Results of the analyses of the edible tissues and the injection site are given in Table 4.

Residues depleted rapidly in all tissues, with no detectable residues in any tissues at 7 days following the final treatment. For the 3 mg CFAE/kg BW treatment, only kidneys and fat contained detectable residues at 3 days, while residues were detectable in all tissues except muscle at the higher treatment rate for this period from final treatment to slaughter. Once samples of any tissue contained no detectable residues for two successive sampling dates, these tissues were not tested for the remaining sampling dates. None of the samples collected at 15 days were tested and only kidneys were tested at 10 days withdrawal. As in previous studies, highest and most persistent residues were found in the kidneys.
APPRAISAL
At the 45th JECFA meeting, an ADI of 0-50 mg/kg bw was established for ceftiofur, based on a microbiological end-point. MRLs were recommended for ceftiofur as follows, for both cattle and pigs: muscle, 200 m g/kg; liver, 2000 m g/kg; kidney, 4000 m g/kg; and fat, 600 m g/kg; and, for cows' milk, 100 m g/l; determined as desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DFC). These MRLs accounted for a maximum daily intake of 640 m g, while the ADI set by the Committee allowed for a maximum daily intake of 3000 m g for a 60-kg person. The Committee agreed to consider additional information on the depletion of ceftiofur, if such information should become available in the future, particularly with respect to the depletion of the marker residue in treated animals 12-72 hours after treatment. The Committee received the following new studies for review, all conducted according to appropriate standards for study protocol and conduct.
Cattle. Six cattle each received an average IM dose of 2.45 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw, administered as ^14C-ceftiofur monohydrochloride, on 5 successive days and were slaughtered 12 hours after the final injection. Total ^14C-residues at slaughter in edible tissues were: muscle, 0.15-0.29 mg/kg; kidney, 6.0-8.3 mg/kg; liver, 1.2-1.8 mg/kg; and fat, 0.35-0.46 mg/kg. Residues in day 1 (initial) injection sites ranged from 0.6-2.7 mg/kg, while the range for day 5 (final) injection sites was 12.6-48.4 mg/kg. Marker residue accounted for approximately one-half the total residue present in all edible tissues at slaughter 12 hours following the final administration of the drug.
Twelve cattle (bw 305 to 455 kg) each received 2.2 mg/kg bw ceftiofur hydrochloride by subcutaneous (SC) injection on 5 successive days, with slaughter 12 hours after the final treatment. Residues in edible tissues, determined as DFC, were: muscle, 0.12-0.29 mg/kg; kidney, 3.7-5.6 mg/kg; and liver, 0.77-1.8 mg/kg. Results were consistent with those observed in studies where the drug was administered by IM injection.
Sixty male calves (98.7 to 168.1 kg bw) were used in a trial conducted at two separate locations. At each location, 15 cattle received 2.0 mg/kg Ceftiofur/kg bw per day as ceftiofur sodium by IM on each of five successive days and the remaining 15 cattle received twice that dose. Edible tissues and injection site tissue were collected from each of three animals slaughtered at 1, 3, 15, 20 or 25 days after the final injection and analyzed for DFC by HPLC. For cattle treated at 2.0 mg/kg bw, no DFC residues were found in muscle at any sampling date. In kidney, residues ranged from 0.27-0.70 mg/kg at day 1, declining to <0.05-0.17 mg/kg at day 3 and were not detected in subsequent samples. Residues in liver were more persistent, declining from 0.10-1.40 mg/kg at day 1, to <0.05-0.46 mg/kg at day 3, and <0.05 mg/kg by day 15. In fat, residues ranged from 0.07-0.15 mg/kg at day 1, <0.05-0.10 mg/kg at day 3, and <0.05 mg/kg at day 15. At the 4.0 mg/kg bw dose, residues in muscle
were <0.05-0.08 mg/kg at day 1, but <0.05 mg/kg on subsequent sampling dates. Residues in kidney, liver and fat were generally higher than at the lower dose, but had depleted in all tissues by day 15, except for liver (<0.05-0.16 mg/kg). Residues in injection sites for the high dose group were 4.2-90 mg/kg at day 1, but had declined to <0.05-0.38 mg/kg at 3 days following final treatment. For the 2.0 mg/kg injection sites, residues ranged from 0.36-9.1 mg/kg at day 1, but were 0.05-0.32 mg/kg at 3 days following final treatment.
Pigs. In the first phase of a study using ^14C-ceftiofur monohydrochloride in which tissues were analyzed for both total ^14C-residues and DFC, six pigs each received three IM doses of 5.0 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw at 24-hour intervals, while another six pigs each received 7.5 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw, following the same treatment regimen. Animals were slaughtered 12 hours after administration of the last injection of ceftiofur and tissues were collected and analyzed. In the second phase of the study, 12 pigs each received IM 3.0 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw on three successive days. Four pigs were slaughtered at each of 12, 72 and 120 hours after the last injection with ceftiofur. Residues increased with increasing dosage, but marker residue was found only in the samples collected from animals slaughtered 12 hours after the final treatment, with the exception of kidney from one pig in the 72-hour group which contained detectable residues. At 12 hours, the DFC residues detected were:
· 3.0 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw: muscle, 0.20-0.35 mg/kg; kidney, <0.05-1.76 mg/kg; liver, 0.55-0.74 mg/kg; and fat, 0.43-0.57 mg/kg.
· 5.0 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw: muscle, 0.40-0.72 mg/kg; kidney, 2.54-3.64 mg/kg; liver, 0.68-1.18 mg/kg; and fat, 0.29-1.29 mg/kg.
· 7.5 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw: muscle, 0.55-0.87 mg/kg; kidney, 3.24-4.98 mg/kg; liver, 1.04-1.59 mg/kg; and fat, 0.62-1.88 mg/kg.
Ratios of total residues, determined as DFC to ^14C-ceftiofur, were, for the various edible tissues, as follows: muscle, 67; kidney, 33; liver, 50; and fat, 40%.
Studies were conducted at two different geographical locations using 30 castrated pigs at each location (bw 22.6 to 33.9 kg), with two treatment groups of 15 animals per site, which received, respectively, 3.0 or 6.0 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw by IM injection on 3 successive days. Samples of muscle, kidney, liver, fat and injection site muscle were collected from each of three animals at each dose rate slaughtered at 1, 3, 7, 10 or 15 days after the third injection and analyzed by HPLC for the marker residue, DFC. At day 1, for the 3 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw treatment, residues were: muscle, 0.12-0.22 mg/kg; kidney, 0.34-0.68 mg/kg; liver, 0.12-0.20 mg/kg; fat, 0.20-0.32 mg/kg; and injection site muscle, 0.09-0.42 mg/kg. At the 6 mg/kg bw treatment rate, residues were: muscle, 0.17-0.28 mg/kg; kidney, 0.48-0.75 mg/kg; liver, 0.18-0.31 mg/kg; fat, 0.26-0.37 mg/kg; and injection site, 0.43-0.78 mg/kg. For the 3 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw treatment, only kidney (0.07 mg/kg) and fat (0.08 mg/kg) from
one pig contained detectable residues at 3 days, while residues were detectable in all tissues except muscle at the 6 mg Ceftiofur/kg bw treatment rate (kidney, 0.06-0.10 mg/kg; liver, <0.05-0.06 mg/kg; and fat, <0.05-0.10 mg/kg). There were no detectable residues in any tissues at either dosing level at 7 days following the final treatment. As in previous studies with pigs, highest and most persistent residues were found in the kidneys. The change in the site of higher residues from kidney to liver at day 1 and at subsequent sampling dates observed in cattle was not seen in pigs.
Maximum Residue Limits
In reaching its decision on the MRLs for ceftiofur, the Committee took into account the following:
· The ADI for ceftiofur established by the 45th JECFA based on a microbiological end-point is 0-50 m g/kg of body weight.
· A significant proportion of the total residue is considered to be inactive because the beta-lactam ring is no longer intact. MRLs are expressed as the marker residue, DFC, which accounts for all active residues and only these are used in calculating a theoretical daily exposure.
· Residues measured as DFC are near or below 0.05 mg/kg (LOD) in muscle and fat and <0.5 mg/kg in liver and kidney at 3 days after treatment in both cattle and pigs in studies provided.
· Based on the depletion studies submitted marker residue in excess of the MRLs established for muscle and kidney by the 45th JECFA may be found in some treated pigs and cattle at 12 hours following final administration in accordance with recommended Good Veterinary Practices.
· The MRLs were harmonized for pigs and cattle, on the basis of the depletion studies submitted.
· The drug is used for therapeutic purposes only.
· No new data were submitted on residue levels in milk.
On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee recommended MRLs for ceftiofur, expressed as DFC, of 1000 m g/kg for muscle, 6000 m g/kg for kidney and 2000 m g/kg for fat in both cattle and pigs. The MRLs recommended by the 45th JECFA for ceftiofur of 2000 m g/kg for liver in both cattle and pigs and 100 m g/l for cows' milk were reaffirmed.
The MRLs recommended above would result in a theoretical maximum daily intake of 1050 m g of microbiologically active ceftiofur residues, expressed as desfuroylceftiofur, based on a daily food intake of 300 g of muscle, 100 g of liver, 50 g each of kidney and fat and 1.5 l of milk.

RESIDUES IN FOOD AND THEIR EVALUATION
Conditions of use
General
Cyfluthrin is a broad spectrum synthetic type II pyrethroid insecticide and acaricide. It is present on the market in a variety of formulations under the trade name Baythroid as wettable powder, emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, concentrates and dusts. Major world-wide uses are for pest control, industrial hygiene and vector control. The veterinary medicinal product consists of a 1% ready-to-use mineral oil formulation with the trade name BAYOFLY Pour-on. Indications for its use include infestations by flies and tabanids of cattle of all ages on pasture including lactating dairy cows. Bayofly should not be used in calves. Withdrawal periods are 0 days for edible tissues and milk of cattle.
Dosages
The standard dose volume (10 mL per animal, corresponding to 100 mg of cyfluthrin) is topically applied to the midline of the back of the animal. The resulting calculated dose ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg of bw, depending on the body weight of the treated animals. The application may be repeated after 4-6 weeks depending on level of re-infestation.
PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of cyfluthrin is largely dependent upon the formulation used. A quantitative comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters is particularly not normally possible, if the information on the vehicle used is incomplete.
Pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals
Summaries of studies in which unlabeled cyfluthrin was orally administered either as a single dose (formulation not given) or over 7 days at different levels in feed to mice and rats were presented. The maximum concentration in sera of rats (average of three animals) of the parent compound was reached 60 minutes after a single dose of 1 mg/kg of bw (Heukamp and Maasfeld 1990). When cyfluthrin was added to the feed of mice (200 and 800 ppm) and rats (150 and 300 ppm), respectively, the concentrations of the parent compound measured in the sera at days 1, 3 and 7 of the feeding experiment were approximately linearly related to the dose in both species. They were highest on day one to three and declined thereafter (Heukamp 1990).
In a large kinetic study [U-^14C] fluorobenzene-ring-labeled cyfluthrin (specific activity 26.9 mCi/mmole, radiochemical purity 98%, cis/trans ratio 42/58) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats in a vehicle of 5% Cremophor^R EL in physiological saline. The time course of the changes of the radioactive counts in body fluids, tissues and excreta as a function of sex, dose, route of administration, and pre-treatment was investigated. Typically 5 animals of each sex were included in each treatment group. Treatment groups alternatively received as single doses either a "low dose" of 0.5 mg/kg of bw (intravenous and oral route), or a "high dose" of 10 mg/kg of bw (oral route), or a "low dose" of 0.5 mg/kg of bw following a 14-day pre-treatment with single daily oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg of bw of the unlabeled active ingredient. The kinetics following a single intraduodenal "low dose" was studied in male rats with bile fistulae. The results of the entire study refer to the sum of
the parent compound and its metabolites.
Absorption following oral administration could be described by a lag time of approximately 0.2 hours and half lives of the order of 0.5 hours for both sexes and irrespective of pre-treatment and of the dose applied. The extent of absorption was calculated as about 100% and 90% in males and females, respectively, with the lowest extent of absorption observed in the "high dose" females (86%). The estimate for the male animals was confirmed in the experiment with the animals with bile duct fistulae.
The radioactivity was slowly distributed after application of an intravenous bolus (half life 1.6 hours in males and 2.6 hours in females, respectively).
After oral administration the maximum concentrations in plasma were reached after approximately 2 hours, in most experiments the elimination from plasma could best be described by the sum of two exponential terms with half lives of 2.7 hours for the first term and 12 hours (males) and 9 hours (females) for the second term.
The excretion of ^14CO[2] was insignificant over a period of 48 hours within which the cumulative excretion via urine and faeces had already reached over 93% and up to 99% of the total recovered radioactivity. The ratio of cumulative urinary/faecal excretion was 2.2 to 3 in male animals and was 1.1 to 1.8 times higher compared to the same ratio in females. It was estimated that approximately one third of the recovered radioactivity was excreted via the bile fluid within the first 48 hours post application of the radioactive dose.
Radioactivity of the tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and renal fat at the time of sacrifice of 48 hours post administration was highest in renal fat, followed by liver/kidney and skeletal muscle (Klein et al. 1983).
The effects on the absorption of the active ingredient of two vehicles was investigated in a further study with male Wistar rats. The animals received a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of b.w. either as a 0.1% emulsion in Cremophor^R EL/distilled water or as a 0.2% solution in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400). The cis/trans ratio of the isomers was 0.84 (45.7% cis-isomers, 54.3% trans-isomers). Two animals of each treatment group were sacrificed 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, and 24 hours after dosing. The individual concentrations of all four isomers were separately determined in samples of whole blood and stomach content.
The maxima of the concentrations in blood (sum of all isomers) were reached 1 hour after administration of the Cremophor^R EL/water emulsion. They were about 4-7 times higher than the maxima obtained with the solution of the active ingredient in PEG 400 which were reached as late as after 6 hours post administration.
In the blood of the Cremophor^R EL group the cis/trans ratio of the isomers increased to about 2.3 over the first four hours and subsequently dropped down to at or below 1. This ratio, however, never exceeded a value of about 1.2 in the PEG 400 group. In the gastric contents of both groups the isomeric ratio remained slightly above 1 over the whole time where measurable concentrations of the isomers were present. The active ingredient initially disappeared much faster from the stomachs of the Cremophor^R EL group than from those of the PEG 400 group. However, the concentrations remaining in the stomachs of the Cremophor^R EL group were still relatively high between 1 and 6 hours post treatment, the period within which the concentrations of the active ingredient dropped down to about 1/10 of the peak concentration (Eben et al. 1982)
Pharmacokinetics in the target animal species
No data were made available for this review.
Metabolism
Metabolism of the permethrinic acid part of the molecule
Studies on the metabolism of cyfluthrin in the rat and the cow were confined to the 3-phenoxy-4-fluoro-benzyl alcohol moiety of the molecule. The metabolism of the remaining permethrinic acid fraction of the molecule is already known from studies with chemically related pyrethroids. One common step of the metabolism of all of these substances is the cleavage of the parent compound at the ester bond yielding permethrinic acid and an individual compound, depending on the structure of the pyrethroid. Ester cleavage of the cyano-pyrethroids is likely to be hydrolytic for the trans-isomers but it may be partly oxidative for the cis-isomers. Both, oxidases and esterases are important in the detoxification of these substances. Hydroxylation of the trans methyl group may take place before ester cleavage. The CN-group of the alpha-cyano pyrethroids is partly excreted as thiocyanate in the urine. Postulated intermediates are the unstable cyanohydrins which are rapidly oxidised to form
an aldehyde and to release HCN (Eben and Thyssen 1981).
In male Swiss-Webster mice which were treated with each of cis- and trans-([^14C]-cyclopropyl)cypermethrin, metabolism occurred mainly by ester cleavage and elimination of the cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid moieties (Cl[2]CA) as glucuronide conjugates. The free acid as well as conjugates with glycine and taurine were also found in the urine of the treated animals. In urine of animals treated with the trans-isomer 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-trans-2-hydroxymethyl-2-methylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (t-HO-Cl[2]CA) was also identified. The lactone of the cis-isomer of this compound (c-HO-Cl[2]CA-lactone) and its glucuronide were tentatively identified (Hutson et al. 1981). The metabolic fate of cypermethrin in young Wistar rats of both sexes was similar (Crawford et al. 1981). The proportions of the major urinary metabolites of cypermethrin were independent on sex or dose in Wistar-derived rats (Rhodes et al. 1984).
Decamethrin labelled in the dibromovinyl carbon atoms and orally administered to male albino mice yielded metabolites which were mostly Br[2]CA, t-HO-Br[2]CA, and their glucuronide conjugates. Smaller amounts of Br[2]CA-glycine and t-HO-Br[2]CA-sulfate were also detected (Ruzo et al. 1979). Similar results were obtained with rats (Ruzo et al. 1978).
After oral administration of permethrin labelled with ^14C in the acid moiety of the molecule the acids (cis- and trans-Cl[2]CA) and some hydroxylated derivatives of these acids, were in part excreted without conjugation. Hydroxylated metabolites were more extensively formed with cis-permethrin than with trans-permethrin (Gaughan et al. 1977).
Jersey cows were treated with either trans- or cis-permethrin labelled with ^14C at the carboxyl group of the acid moiety, c-HO-Cl[2]CA-lactones appeared in both faeces and urine. The remaining metabolites Cl[2]CA, c- and t-HO-Cl[2]CA and various conjugates (including glutamic acid conjugates) appeared only in the urine (Gaughan et al. 1978).
Metabolism of the 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzyl alcohol moiety of the molecule in the rat
In a preliminary study a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of bw of [U-^14C]-fluorobenzene labelled cyfluthrin was given to male Sprague Dawley rats ("as apparent solution in physiological saline containing detergent"). More than 65% of the radioactivity were excreted in urine within the first 24 hours post treatment. The metabolites found in the urine collected during the first eight hours were tentatively identified as conjugates of 4'-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid (33% of administered radioactivity) and 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid (27% of administered radioactivity), respectively (Ecker 1982).
In a further study with Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes the treatment scheme of the above mentioned (Klein et al. 1983) kinetic study was followed except that the intraduodenal treatment was omitted. By separating and quantitatively determining the radioactivity associated with the parent drug, free and conjugated 4'-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid and free and conjugated 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid, 65 to 82% of the recovered radioactivity could be assigned to identified compounds isolated from urine and/or faeces. Metabolism was slightly dependent on the dose, in so far as higher concentrations of the parent drug were found in faeces of animals given a single "high dose" (10 mg/kg of bw) or which were pre-treated with 14 daily oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg bw of unlabeled drug.
After intraperitoneal administration of 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg cyfluthrin/kg of bw in 0.02-0.04% polyethylene glycol 400 to Wistar rats, 24 to 42% of the alpha-cyano group of the active ingredient was excreted through the kidneys as thiocyanate (Eben and Thyssen 1981).
Metabolism of the 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzyl alcohol moiety of the molecule in the cow
[Phenyl-UL-^14C]cyfluthrin, 98.5% radiochemically pure, was orally administered to one lactating Holstein dairy cow on five consecutive days at a dose level of 0.5 mg/kg bw. The substance was formulated in a gelatine capsule with 5 g of alpha-lactose. Milk samples were taken each day after the morning and evening milking. The cow was slaughtered on day 6 after the morning milking.
Nearly all of the radioactive residue (fat >93%, muscle >98%, kidney 99%, liver 100%) was extractable with organic solvents. Tissues had radioactive residues of 622 m g/kg in liver, 120 m g/kg in subcutaneous fat to 230 m g/kg in renal and omental fat, 188 m g/kg in kidney, 40 m g/kg in heart and 21 m g/kg in shoulder and 28 m.g/kg in loin muscle. More than 93% of the radioactivity in the tissues was identified. Kidney, heart, liver, fat and muscle contained unmetabolized cyfluthrin in amounts of 56%, 71%, 86%, >93% and 98%, respectively. The only metabolites found were 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (14% in liver) and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (29% in heart and 43% in liver, respectively).
Milk contained a maximum of 79 m g/kg total radioactive residue (24 hours after the 3rd dose), of which 98% was unmetabolized cyfluthrin (Straw II et al. 1983).
TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
Residue depletion studies with radiolabelled cyfluthrin were not available for the present review. All studies discussed here were conducted with unlabelled active ingredient using a variety of formulations.
In three residue depletion studies (I. Woodley 1985 (1), 1985 (2), 1986 (1)) cyfluthrin was dermally applied to female Hereford cattle, poured along dorsal midline at dose levels of 400 mg/animal and 800 mg/animal, respectively, in each study. The range of the animal body weights was from 345 to 445 kg in these studies. The formulation applied was prepared from 10% wettable powder which was dispersed in tap water. Groups of three animals per dose level were sacrificed 1, 3, 7 days (I. Woodley 1985 (1)), 10, 14 days (I. Woodley 1985 (2)), and 42 days (I. Woodley 1986 (1)) post dose, respectively. None of the samples of liver, kidney and muscle contained detectable residues of the parent compound. The limit of detection was 10 m g/kg (GLC with electron capture detection). Visceral fat from the bellies was the only tissue with quantifiable residues of the parent compound. Maximum concentrations of approximately 90 m g/kg were found in fat of the high-dose group 14 days after
treatment.
In another study (Woodley 1986 (2)), a pour-on formulation (Bay 1704, 1% w/v Pour on 034-V) was used. 200 mg per animal were applied to 21 Hereford cattle (17 females, 4 castrated males) in one spot between the shoulder blades. Three animals were slaughtered at each of seven different time points post dose (1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days). Again, fat was the only tissue with quantifiable residues. The highest concentrations, in the order of 50 m g/kg, were found on days 7 to 14 after treatment.
Waggoner and Kohlenberg reported two studies where cattle were topically dosed along the backline with cyfluthrin 1% pour-on formulations. Following sacrifice the concentration of parent compound was determined in fat, liver, kidney and muscle. In the first study (Waggoner and Kohlenberg 1990 (1)) two groups of three female Holstein cattle were treated. One group received 0.63 mg/kg of bw on day one and a second dose of 0.9 mg/kg of bw 13 days later. The animals were sacrificed two days after the second treatment. Residues of the parent compound were found in fat (average 90 m g/kg), kidney (average 12 m g/kg) and liver (average 8 m g/kg). No residues were detected in muscle. The other group was treated five times with 0.9 mg/kg of bw (three doses at one-day intervals on the first three days, 2 further doses at intervals of 12 days). The animals were sacrificed two days after the fifth treatment. Again no residue was detected in any sample of muscle meat. Residues in the
other tissues, however, were more variable and (on the average) higher than in the first treatment group. The values found (3 animals) were 170, 86, and 240 m g/kg in fat, 17, 12, and 23 m g/kg in kidney, and 22, 9, and 8 m g/kg in liver.
These studies showed that under the described conditions of significant overdosing, residue levels in fat were about 7.5 to 9.5 times higher than in any other of the standard edible tissues.
In the second study (Waggoner and Kohlenberg 1990 (1)) the same authors treated 3 groups each of 3 yearling cattle (Hereford, Angus and mixed breed) with either one, two or three doses of 0.44 mg/kg of bw of Mobay's cyfluthrin 1% pour-on formulation. The dose interval was 21 days. Animals were slaughtered 3 days after the last treatment. Fat was the only tissue were quantifiable residues were found. The average concentrations increased approximately linearly with the number of repeated doses and were 31, 86 and 122 m g/kg after one, two and three doses, respectively.
In a further study with Friesian Lowland cattle Bayofly pour on, 10 ml of the product per 300 kg of animal weight equivalent to about 0.22-0.25 mg/kg of bw, were poured along the animal withers. Two animals were killed on each of days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post application. No detectable residues were found in liver, kidney and muscle. Concentrations of residues in fat increased from day 1 (14 m g/kg) to day 14 (34 m g/kg) and then decreased to reach 16 m g/kg on day 28.
In a study (Shaw II and Ayers 1983) designed to simulate the continuous uptake by dairy cattle of cyfluthrin residues of feed originating from plants treated with plant protection products, the animals received the drug orally once per day over 29 days in a capsule containing 9 g of alpha-lactose. The doses were adjusted to simulate concentrations in feed of 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. Residues were monitored in selected milk samples and all three animals of each dose group were slaughtered on day 29, shortly after the administration of the last dose. Fat, liver, kidney and muscle tissues were analysed for the presence of the parent drug. Liver and kidney were also assayed for 'acid'-Baythroid (cyanogroup transformed to carboxyl group) and the sum of 'FPB acid' (4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid), 'FPB aid' (4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzaldehyde) and 'FPB ale' (4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol). The analyses of liver were repeated two years later (Murphy 1985) when it became
evident that the contract laboratory of the first analysis had not complied with the foreseen analytical procedure. Concentrations of the parent compounds in liver and kidney samples were, therefore, initially underestimated. The maximum residue concentration in milk (parent compounds) was reached at day 14 with a range from 160 to 260 m g/kg in the high dose group. The corresponding values were 100 to 170 m g/kg on day 28. The concentrations of the parent drug were lower, in a dose dependent manner, in milk from the low-dose and intermediate-dose animals on day 28.
The concentrations of the parent drug found in fat were the highest of all standard edible tissues. The average values were dose-dependent (250 m g/kg of residue at feed level of 5 mg/kg, 700 m g/kg of residue at feed level of 15 mg/kg, and 2600 m g/kg of residue at feed level of 50 mg/kg). In muscle no parent drug was detectable in the tissues of the animals of the low-dose group and in two of the animals of the intermediate-dose group. The respective concentration in muscle tissues of the high-dose group was 30 m g/kg. The concentrations in liver and kidney of the parent drug were 130 and 170 m g/kg, respectively, in tissues of high dose animals. The sum of all metabolites was <30 m g/kg in liver and kidney, respectively, in samples of the same animals.
P. Hedemann (1985 (1), 1985 (2), 1986) conducted three studies where cyfluthrin was topically applied to either Friesian or Illawara Shorthorn dairy cattle. In the first two studies Bay 1704 1% pour on was applied to the dorsal midline (two groups dosed with 100 and 200 mg/animal, respectively). In the third study a 0.2% formulation was prepared from 10% wettable powder and water and was sprayed on the animals along the backline. In this study 400 and 800 mg/animal, respectively, were applied. None of the milk samples taken up to 56 hours post administration contained detectable quantities of the parent drug (limit of detection 10 m g/kg). However, in a study which was apparently similarly designed 10 m g/kg of parent drug were found in one sample taken 3 days post administration and in three samples taken 5 days post dosing in the group dosed with 800 mg/animal (P. Gyr 1987).
Two groups of three Holstein dairy cattle each were treated with cyfluthrin with a 1% pour on formulation. The animals of the first group received a single dose equivalent to 0.63 mg/kg of bw. In the second group the animals were treated three times at daily intervals with 0.9 mg/kg of bw. The maximum concentrations of the parent drug in whole milk of the animals treated only once, were found 2-4 days post administration. They were in the order of 6-26 m g/kg. In milk samples of the animals treated three times with the higher dose maximum concentrations ranged from 23 to 54 m g/kg and were reached 1-2 days after the last administration (Waggoner and Kohlenberg 1990 (2)).
Bayofly was dermally applied to 6 Friesian dairy cows at doses equivalent to 200 mg/animal. Residues of the parent drug were analysed in milk samples taken 9, 24, and 72 hours post dosing, respectively. The results of this study were expressed on the basis of the fat content of the milk. The highest concentrations were measured in samples taken 1 day after treatment and were ranging from 50 to 210 m g/kg (Alexander and Booth 1989).
METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR RESIDUES IN TISSUES
The analytical parts of a number of residue studies refer to a method described in Mobay Report 85883 (Straw II et al. 1983 (1)). The report fully describes a gas chromatographic method for measuring the intact residues of BAYTHROID in bovine and poultry tissues, milk and eggs. Baythroid is removed from the sample matrix by solvent extraction followed by partitionning steps and purification on silica gel (column or Florisil Sep-Pak cartridge). The purified extract is then subjected to GLC with electron capture detection without prior derivatization. A standard column and a second confirmatory column is proposed. The isomers are not separated. Several chromatograms and some recovery data are included in the report. The limit of detection is in the order of 10 m g/kg for all tissues. The method was, e.g., used with minor modifications in residue studies reported by Waggoner and Kohlenberg (1990 (1) and (2)). Since in these studies all samples were analysed in duplicate, the %
RSD for incurred tissues could be estimated. It was slightly concentration dependent. Most estimates were ranging between 0 and 10% with some outliers up to about 35%.
A routine method for the determination of residues of BAYOFLY in bovine tissues and milk has been developed more recently (Maasfeld 1989). This method is to be considered as the proposed regulatory method. The fully described method uses acetonitril for extraction. Lipids are removed with hexane. The dry residue remaining after solvent evaporation is further cleaned on a silica column or on Sep-Pak-C[18] cartridge. Following solvent evaporation of the fraction containing cyfluthrin the dry residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and subjected to capillary GLC with electron capture detection. The four isomers are sufficiently separated to allow their separate determination.
Recovery experiments were conducted with fortified tissues at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg for fat, kidney, liver and muscle; 0.005 and 0.05 mg/kg for milk) performing five replicate analyses of each tissue/concentration pair. Depending on the matrix and the analyte concentration the recoveries were between 72 and 89% with relative standard deviations of 4-12%.
Three control samples of each matrix were analyzed in order to estimate the limit of detection (LOD) which was defined as average noise of the baseline of the chromatographic trace plus three times the standard deviation of this figure. The reported LOD's are 0.001 mg/kg for milk, 0.002 mg/kg for muscle and kidney, and 0.003 mg/kg for liver and fat.
For the definition of the limit of quantification (LOQ) the requirements were as follows: recovery >70% and RSD <0.2. With these requirements the LOQ was 0.005 mg/kg for milk and 0.01 mg/kg for liver, kidney, muscle and fat.
The specificity of the method was confirmed with permethrin and cypermethrin.
The method was applied to incurred tissues obtained in a residue depletion study with cattle (Dom and Maasfeld 1989 (1)). In three of 12 fat samples analysed in duplicate the variability of the analytical results was higher than expected, if compared with the results obtained with fortified control samples.
RESIDUES IN EDIBLE ANIMAL TISSUES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF CYFLUTHRIN IN CROP PROTECTION
The sponsor has provided a copy of relevant parts of the dossier submitted to European Community authorities in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. From the data which cannot be fully discussed in this monograph, it appears, however, that the use of cyfluthrin for spray treatment in agriculture and horticulture does not lead to a quantifiable transfer of residues from animal feed to liver, kidney and muscle tissues. Residues in fatty tissues and milk of animals which are transferred from feed as a result of the use of cyfluthrin in crop protection should be significantly lower than those found after authorized uses of the veterinary product.
APPRAISAL
The Committee reviewed numerous data including both proprietary information and data from the open literature. A comprehensive expert report covering the use of cyfluthrin in veterinary medicine and an additional report dealing with the residues of the compound that are likely to result from non-veterinary uses had also been provided.
Residues in tissues
Residue depletion studies with radiolabelled cyfluthrin were not available for the present review. All studies presented were conducted with unlabelled active ingredient in a variety of formulations.
In three similarly designed residue depletion studies, a formulation of cyfluthrin was topically applied to cattle at dose levels of 400 mg/animal (0.9-1.1 mg/kg of bw) and 800 mg/animal (1.8-2.3 mg/kg of bw), respectively, in each study. The formulation applied was prepared from 10% wettable powder dispersion in water. Groups of three animals per dose level were sacrificed 1, 3 and 7 days or 10 and 14 days or 42 days post-dose, respectively. None of the samples of muscle, liver and kidney contained detectable residues of the parent compound. The limit of detection was 10 m g/kg. Maximum concentrations of 70-100 m g/kg were found in visceral fat of the high-dose group 14 days after treatment.
In four other studies cattle were dosed with cyfluthrin 1% pour-on formulations. In the first of these four studies, 200 mg/animal (0.5-0.93 mg/kg of bw) were applied to 21 cattle. Three animals were slaughtered at each of seven different time-points post-dose (1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days). Fat was the only tissue with quantifiable residues. The highest concentrations, approximately 50 m g/kg, were found on days 7 to 14 after treatment.
In the second study the cattle were treated with 0.33 mg/kg of bw. Two animals were sacrificed on each of days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post application of the dose. No detectable residues were present in muscle, liver and kidney. Concentrations of residues in fat increased from day 1 (14 and 15 m g/kg) to a maximum of 32 and 36 m g/kg on day 14 and then decreased to reach 14 and 18 m g/kg on day 28 post-dose.
In the third study, two groups of three cattle each were treated. One group received 0.63 mg/kg of bw on day one and a second dose of 0.9 mg/kg of bw 13 days later. The animals were sacrificed two days after the second treatment. No residues were detected in muscle. Residues of the parent compound were found in liver (6-9 m g/kg), kidney (11-13 m g/kg) and fat (72-110 m g/kg). The second group was treated five times with 0.9 mg/kg of bw (one daily dose during the first three days and 2 further doses at 12-day intervals). The animals were sacrificed two days after the fifth treatment. The concentrations of residues were 8-22 m g/kg in liver, 12-23 m g/kg in kidney, and 86-240 m g/kg in fat. This study showed that under the described conditions of significant overdosing, residue levels in fat were about 7.5 times higher than in kidney and 9.5 times higher than in liver.
In the fourth study, three groups each of three yearling cattle were treated with either one, two or three doses of 0.44 mg/kg of bw. The dose interval was 21 days. Animals were slaughtered 3 days after the last treatment. Fat was the only tissue where quantifiable residues were found. The concentrations increased with the number of repeated doses and were 21-42 m g/kg after one, 77-102 m g/kg after two, and 104-151 m g/kg after three doses.
The four studies indicate that residues in fat increase with increasing dosage and only in the highest treatment study (significant overdosing) were residues of liver and kidney quantifiable. No residues were detected in muscle tissue.
Residues in Milk
Two groups of three dairy cattle each were treated with cyfluthrin as a 1% pour-on formulation. The animals of the first group received a single dose equivalent to 0.63 mg/kg of bw. In the second group the animals were treated three times at daily intervals with 0.9 mg/kg of bw. The maximum concentrations of the parent drug in whole milk of the animals treated only once were found 2-4 days after treatment. They were 6-26 m g/kg. At 7 days after treatment the concentrations of residues were 2-5 m g/kg. In milk samples of the animals treated three times with the higher dose, maximum concentrations ranged from 23 to 54 m g/kg and were reached 1-2 days after the last administration.
Method of Analysis
A routine method for the determination of the marker residue of cyfluthrin in bovine tissues and milk was proposed. The residues are extracted with organic solvent and solid phase chromatography and subjected to capillary gas liquid chromatography with electron capture detection. The four diastereoisomers are sufficiently resolved to allow their separate determination.
Recovery experiments were conducted with fortified tissues at two concentrations (10 and 50 m g/kg for muscle, liver, kidney and fat; 5 and 50 m g/kg for milk). Depending on the matrix and the analyte concentration, the recoveries were between 72 and 89% with relative standard deviations of 4-12%.
The reported LOD's were 1 m g/kg for milk, 2 m g/kg for muscle and kidney, and 3 m g/kg for liver and fat. The LOQ was 5 m g/kg for milk and 10 m g/kg for muscle, liver, kidney and fat. The specificity of the method was confirmed in the presence of permethrin and cypermethrin.
Maximum Residue Limits
The Committee confirmed the ADI of 0-20 m g/kg of bw previously allocated by JMPR. This would result in a maximum acceptable daily intake of 1200 m g for a 60-kg person. In recommending MRLs, the Committee took also into account the following facts:
· Fat was the only suitable target tissue.
· Residue concentrations in liver and kidney are about 10 times lower than those in fat.
· The parent compound was the only marker residue and the only residue of concern.
· There was no residue study available which had been conducted exactly at the upper limit of the recommended dose range (0.5 mg/kg of bw) and with repeated dosing at 28 day intervals, the shortest recommended time interval for repetition of the treatment. The numerous available data showed that
- estimates of the maximum concentrations resulting from a given single dose could be obtained by linear interpolation of the data obtained with other similar doses,
- only studies with identical formulations of cyfluthrin could be quantitatively compared,
- the kinetics of repeated treatment could be described by superposition and addition of the data obtained after a single dose with the same formulation,
- the results obtained after identical treatment could vary highly from animal to animal.
The maximum residue concentration in milk, expressed as the geometric mean of the data, could be interpolated to approximately 13 m g/l. The expected maximum residue level in fat at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg of bw, representing the upper limit of the recommended dose range, could be estimated by interpolation from the results of the available studies to be 40 m g/kg.
The maximum residue concentrations in fat were reached between 10 and 14 days after a single dose. The residue levels decreased to 50% around 28 days post-dose and to 30% of the maximum concentration around 40 days post-dose. The expected numerical value of the maximum after one repetition of the treatment would be approximately 1.3-times higher than the maximum value obtained after a single dose. With more than one repetition at 28 day intervals, the maximum concentration would probably not exceed 1.5 times the maximum obtained after a single dose. It could therefore be estimated that the highest concentration, expressed as the geometric mean of the obtained values, to be observed after repeated treatments at the recommended dose interval and the upper limit of the recommended dose range would be in the order of 1.5 x 40 m g/kg = 60 m g/kg. This value could serve as a basis for establishing an MRL in fat.
It was, however, necessary to also consider the significant biological variability of the residue concentrations in fat of individual animals. It was observed that the geometric mean plus three times its standard deviation would cover this variability.
Taking all these factors into account, an MRL for fat of 200 m g/kg was recommended. This is the only MRL which can be used to monitor residues of cyfluthrin in edible tissues of treated cattle. The recommended MRL for liver and kidney in both tissues was 20 m g/kg. The recommended MRL for muscle was 20 m g/kg on the basis of twice the limit of quantification of the analytical method. This MRL, however, far exceeds the estimated concentrations of the residues in muscle resulting from the use of the drug following the label instructions and can, therefore, not be used to monitor residues in the other tissues. Liver and kidney tissues are not suited as target tissues for the control of residues of cyfluthrin in cattle.
The maximum residue concentration in milk, expressed as the geometric mean of the data could be interpolated to approximately 13 m g/kg. Taking into account the standard deviation of that figure, an MRL for milk was recommended at 40 m g/kg.
The present Committee noted that the MRLs for apple, cotton seed, rape seed, maize, sweet peppers and tomato recommended by the JMPR in 1987 resulted in a TMDI of 4% of the ADI (Middle Eastern diet), 0.7% (Far Eastern diet), 1.2% (African diet), 1.5% (Latin American diet) and 4.6% (European diet), respectively. The MRLs for muscle, liver, kidney and fat recommended by the present Committee would result in an additional TMDI of 79 m g/person or 6.6% of the ADI.
It was also noted that the JMPR had recommended an MRL of 10 m g/kg for milk suggesting that it was covering the veterinary uses of cyfluthrin. The present Committee, however, noted that important studies of the residues in milk had not been available to the JMPR for evaluation. It was, therefore, necessary to propose a higher MRL for milk, in order to cover the authorized uses of cyfluthrin in veterinary medicine.

RESIDUES IN FOOD AND THEIR EVALUATION
CONDITIONS OF USE
General
Danofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone with broad spectrum antibacterial activity. It is used in the treatment of respiratory disease in chickens, cattle and pigs. Danofloxacin is not intended for use in dairy cattle producing milk for human consumption and not in laying hens.
Dosage
In chickens, the drug is administered dissolved in the drinking water, with the recommended therapeutic regimens being 5 mg/kg BW for 3 days for treatment of E. coli respiratory disease and Chronic Complicated Respiratory Disease and 50 mg/kg BW for 3 days in treating mycoplasmosis of chicks less than 1 week of age. For the treatment of respiratory disease in cattle and swine, the drug is administered by intramuscular (im) or subcutaneous (sc) injection at 1.25 mg/kg BW for 3-5 days.
METABOLISM
Pharmacokinetics
Cattle
Plasma: Danofloxacin was administered at 1.25 mg/kg BW for 5 days by either im or sc routes and for one day only by the iv route to calves at an average starting weight of 112 kg. Plasma danofloxacin concentrations were measured over 24 hours after treatment on days 1, 3 and 5. There was bioequivalence between the routes of administration. The half lives in the plasma ranged from 3.9 to 4.4 h. After im and sc administration the peak plasma concentration was reached at 0.8-1.3 h with the maximum concentration of 0.39 - 0.48 mg/l (Pfizer Inc, 1990b, 1991b).
Excreta: Five steers and four heifers (mean BW 186 kg) were each injected once daily for five consecutive days with a 2.5% aqueous solution of ^3H-danofloxacin at the recommended dose of 1.25 mg/kg BW. The total concentration of drug-related material in the excreta reached a plateau by the third day of treatment; it declined to a low level (ca. 6 m g/kg) by the second day after the last treatment.
Approximately equal amounts of drug-related material were excreted in urine and faeces. About 54-58% of drug-related material in faeces collected during days 4 and 5 consisted of unchanged danofloxacin. The desmethyl metabolite was also detected, but its concentration was too low to be measured quantitatively. The balance consisted of trace amounts of polar materials. In urine, unchanged drug accounted for 88-94% of the radioactivity, while the desmethyl metabolite accounted for the remainder (Pfizer Inc, 1989a).
Pigs
Male and female pigs (ca. 40 kg) were administered im a single dose of 1.25 mg/kg BW. Peak danofloxacin concentrations in plasma and lung at one hour post-dosing were 0.40 and 1.68 mg/l, respectively with a half-life of 7 h in plasma (Pfizer Inc, 1991c). During the treatment period the excretion into urine was 2-3 times higher than that in faeces.
Chickens
Plasma and Lung: Danofloxacin was administered to 18-day old broilers in the drinking water at a dose equivalent to 5 mg/kg BW for 3 days. Twelve hours after treatment initiation, steady-state concentrations of 0.21 mg/l and 0.43 mg/kg Danofloxacin were attained in plasma and lung tissue, respectively. Desmethyldanofloxacin was not detected. After treatment withdrawal, the concentration of danofloxacin in both plasma and lung tissue declined with half lives of ca. 5-6 hours (Pfizer Inc, 1990a).
Excreta: Broilers were given ^3H-danofloxacin (5 mg/kg BW) for five days in their drinking water. Overall mean radioactivity ranged from 35 to 46.5 mg/kg for the five days of treatment, and attained an apparent steady state by the first day of treatment. The concentration dropped to 20 mg/kg on the first withdrawal day and to 6.6 mg/kg on the second day. Assays of samples on treatment days 2 to 5 and withdrawal day 2 indicated that the levels of unchanged danofloxacin in excreta were approximately 85% of the total. Excretion was not different between the males and females (Pfizer Inc, 1988a, Pfizer Inc, 1991a).
Metabolism in Animals
The biotransformation of danofloxacin was investigated in rats, dogs, chickens, cattle and pigs. A tritium label was introduced into the danofloxacin molecule at the C-1 position of the cyclopropyl ring. The radiochemical purity of the material used was >99% and it was shown to be metabolically stable as less than 0.1% of radioactivity excreted in the urine of dosed rats was tritiated water.
Danofloxacin was found to be metabolized in a quantitatively similar manner in rats, dogs, and swine along pathways predictable from studies reported for other quinolones. Metabolism in cattle and chickens is also similar to the other species examined. The metabolic pathways are shown in Figure 1. The major component in the excreta of each species was unchanged drug, and in rats and dogs at least, elimination appeared to be by both renal and hepatic routes. Very small quantities of N-desmethyldanofloxacin are detected in the excreta of all species. The N-oxide was detected as a urinary metabolite in dogs (ca. 26%) and swine (ca. 12%) and to a lesser extent in rats (ca. 5%). A glucuronide conjugate was also present in small quantities in the urine of dogs (ca. 6%), rats (2-3%) and swine (2-3%).
Figure 1. Metabolism of Danofloxacin
In cattle, pigs and chickens the tissue which was shown to have the highest residue was the liver. The liver was shown to contain danofloxacin as a major drug-related component and the only metabolite detected at more than 10% of the total residue was desmethyldanofloxacin (see Table 1). In swine, the desmethyl metabolite comprised the majority of drug-related residues (>90%) by 48 hours post-dose and essentially all of the detectable residues by 6 or more days post-dose. Traces of other components could not be identified or quantitated (Pfizer Inc, 1990c, 199 Id, 1991e, 1990d and 1990e).
A comparative excretion study in mice, in which animals received oral doses of either danofloxacin or desmethyldanofloxacin, showed that mice treated with danofloxacin were also systemically exposed to the major metabolite (Pfizer Inc, 1990f).

TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
Radiolabeled Residue Depletion Studies
Cattle
^3H-Danofloxacin was administered to mature cattle by once daily im injection at 1.25 mg/kg BW for 5 successive days. Total, unchanged danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin residues were determined in edible tissues collected at 12, 24, 36, (1st study, Pfizer Inc, 1989c & 1990j) 48, 60 and 72 hours (2nd study, Pfizer Inc, 1990g) after the last treatment. Concentrations of total radiolabeled residues are given in Table 2.
The liver samples were extracted under acidic conditions and further analysed by using HPLC for the content of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. The results are shown in Table 3.

The highest concentrations of residues, as measured by radioactivity, were consistently found in the liver. Total residues in kidney, muscle, fat and at the injection site (IS) declined faster than in liver. Analysis of the liver for danofloxacin and its major metabolite showed that whereas the parent drug comprised about 21-32% of the labeled residue, the metabolite proportion declined gradually from 40% at 12 hours to 14% at 72 hours. At 48 h after dosing the residue concentrations in the injection site muscle were similar to those in muscle (Pfizer Inc, 1989c and 1990g).
The depletion of danofloxacin residues at higher dose levels in cattle was investigated by administering danofloxacin as a single subcutaneous (sc) injection at 4, 6 and 8 mg/kg BW. Total, unchanged danofloxacin and desmethyl metabolite residues were determined in the livers and injection sites collected at 8 and 12 hours after treatment. The highest concentrations were at 8 h with the higher dose (mean total residues were 8768 m g/kg in liver and 138183 m g/kg at injection site) and the lowest concentrations at 12 h with the lower dose (mean total residues were 2146 m g/kg in liver and 1765 m g/kg at injection site) (Pfizer Inc, 1996a).
Pigs
^3H-Danofloxacin was administered to mature pigs by once daily im injection at 1.25 mg/kg for 5 successive days. Total, unchanged danofloxacin and desmethyl metabolite residues were determined in edible tissues collected at 12, 24, 48 and 168 hours after the last treatment. The results for the total residues are shown in Table 4.
The highest concentrations of radioactive substances were found in the liver at 12 hours, and this tissue continued to have the highest radioactive content for up to 7 days post-dosing (Pfizer Inc, 1989d). The rate of decline of radioactivity in tissues including the injection site was characterised by half lives of 22-24 h for muscle, fat and injection site, 41 h for kidney, and 72 h for liver.

The content of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin in the pooled liver samples were measured by an HPLC assay which used acetonitrile as the extractant. The results (see Table 5) show that at 12 h both compounds were present in equal amounts but at later times the desmethyldanofloxacin was the more abundant residue. Although no acidification was used in this assay the values for the summed percentages of both compounds are close to 100% because the standard curve was made in similar liver homogenates.

^3H-Danofloxacin was administered in drinking water to three-week-old chickens to achieve a targeted dose of 5.0 mg danofloxacin/kg BW/day for 5 days. Birds were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after withdrawal of the treatment and the total residues in their edible tissues were measured. Results are presented in Table 6.

These findings demonstrated that the highest concentration of total residues was consistently found in the liver and that total residues in kidney and muscle declined at the same rate as in liver.
Pooled liver homogenates prepared from birds in the above study were also assayed by an HPLC method for unchanged danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. The results are shown as percentages of the total residues in Table 7. Danofloxacin was the residue of greatest concentration and desmethyldanofloxacin was the major metabolite (Pfizer Inc, 1988b).

Total residues were also determined in one-day-old chickens medicated for 3 days with ^3H-danofloxacin at 44 mg/l in the drinking water which was equivalent to approximately 28-48 mg/kg BW. This corresponds to an anti-mycoplasma therapeutic programme of 500 mg/l in the drinking water, which is limited to birds of less than one week of age. Mean total residues in liver, kidney, muscle and fat/skin declined from 2260, 1380, 600 and 430 m g/kg at 6 hours to 430, 19, 5 and 10 m g/kg by 14 days (Pfizer Inc, 1990i).
Other Depletion Studies (with Unlabeled Drug)
Cattle
The depletion of danofloxacin from cattle tissues was evaluated where five groups of six cattle each received a single daily im dose of danofloxacin at 1.25 mg/kg for five successive days. Muscle, liver, kidney, fat and injection site samples were obtained at 12, 36, 60, 84 and 120 hours after the last injection and were analyzed after an acid hydrolysis step by HPLC with fluorescence detection for the presence of danofloxacin and its major metabolite, desmethyldanofloxacin. These findings demonstrate that the residues deplete at rates comparable to those of the total residues. At 5 days withdrawal, danofloxacin was measurable only in the liver and the metabolite was below the assay sensitivity (10 m g/kg) in all tissues (Pfizer Inc, 199 If). The results are shown in Table 8.

The depletion of danofloxacin from swine tissues was evaluated where five groups of four pigs each received a single daily intramuscular dose of danofloxacin at 1.25 mg/kg BW for three successive days. Muscle, liver, kidney, fat and injection site samples were obtained at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 days after the last injection and were analyzed after an acid hydrolysis step by HPLC with fluorescence detection for the presence of danofloxacin and its major metabolite, desmethyldanofloxacin. The concentrations of danofloxacin (see Table 9) declined rapidly in all tissues, so that by the first withdrawal interval (2 days) danofloxacin was present in only very low concentrations (<40 m g/kg). By 6 days post-treatment, danofloxacin was not detectable in any tissue. The desmethyldanofloxacin was present only in the liver and the concentrations declined from a maximum at 1065 m g/kg at 2 days to <80 m g/kg at 18 days post-treatment (Pfizer Inc, 1991g).

Chickens
The depletion of danofloxacin from chicken tissues was evaluated where danofloxacin mesylate soluble powder was administered in drinking water to three-week-old chickens at 5.0 mg danofloxacin/kg BW/day for 3 days, according to label directions. Muscle, liver and skin/fat samples were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 hours after withdrawal of the treatment from 3 birds/sex and were analyzed after acid hydrolysis by HPLC with fluorometric detection for the presence of danofloxacin and its major metabolite, desmethyldanofloxacin. The findings (see Table 10) show that danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin depleted rapidly from chicken tissues following drug withdrawal with liver always containing the highest concentrations. Both components declined to less than 50 m g/kg at 36 hours withdrawal. All other tissues contained lower concentrations of danofloxacin than did the liver, while the metabolite was undetected (Pfizer Inc, 1990h).

Another residue study was reported in which approximate 30-day-old chickens were given danofloxacin in the drinking water at either 5.2 mg/kg bw for 3 days or 5.1 mg/kg bw for 5 days (Stracciari, 1991). The compounds were assayed with HPLC after an acid hydrolysis and solvent extraction procedure. The results are shown in Table 11.

Bound Residues/Bioavailability
The extraction of ^3H-labeled residues from the tissues of cattle, chickens and pigs administered ^3H-danofloxacin was carried out using two differing sets of conditions. There was an initial extraction using only organic solvents (mild extraction) and a second stage where the tissues were subjected to either acid or alkaline conditions for further organic solvent extraction. After solvent extraction only part of the total radioactivity was extracted indicating there was evidence of binding of a considerable fraction of the radiolabeled residues. However after acid hydrolysis (or alkaline) most of the radioactivity was released (see Table 12). The percentage of the residues which were not liberated by the mild extraction procedure increased with increasing withdrawal time, however, the amount of total residues were declining with time (Pfizer Inc, 1988b, Pfizer Inc, 1989c, Pfizer Inc 1989d).

The specific residues of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin were measured in the radiolabeled studies (see above) and indicate that after hydrolysis the sum of these two compounds represented about half the free residues in bovine liver and 50-80% in chicken liver. The results for the pig study (see Table 5) are not appropriate.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR RESIDUES IN TISSUES
General. The methods outlined below are those submitted by the sponsor as candidate regulatory methods. For routine monitoring purposes danofloxacin concentration at the m g/kg level in cattle and poultry tissue was determined by a liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection following an extraction using acid hydrolysis and solvent partition from tissue homogenates or fat. The method is a refinement of the methods used in the studies to obtain the data for the content of residues in the target animals. In those studies, they were either carried out without recourse to an acid hydrolysis step (e.g. Pfizer Inc, 1989c) or in subsequent studies there were minor variations e.g. the acid hydrolysis was done at 50°C for 1 hour (e.g. Pfizer Inc, 1990g). A method to confirm the presence of danofloxacin in liver tissues used HPLC combined with mass-spectrometry.
Liquid Chromatography-Fluorescence Detection. Liver, kidney, muscle, fat, and injection site muscle samples were extracted following homogenization in the presence of extraction solvent, then incubated at 55°C for 90 minutes. The samples were cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, and a sample of supernate taken for analysis. Separation was achieved on a Inertsil C8 reverse phase LC system using a combination of phosphate buffer (0.05M, pH 3.5) and acetonitrile (12%). Detection was achieved with fluorescence excitation at 280 nm, while monitoring emission at 440 nm. The assay was quantitated using external standards. The assay has a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10 m g/kg and was linear over the range 10-500 m g/kg in liver, muscle, kidney, fat, and injection site muscle. Recovery of danofloxacin from all tissues was near 100%. The accuracy of the method was between 99-103% with the precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, 2% or less. The method
demonstrated chromatographic resolution from other fluoroquinolones including, desmethyldanofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, sarafloxacin, marbofloxacin, and sparfloxacin (Pfizer Inc, 1995a and 1996b).
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry of Liver Tissues. Liver samples were extracted following homogenization in the presence of extraction solvent, then incubated at 55 °C for 90 minutes. The samples were cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, and a sample of supernate was subjected to liquid-liquid extraction. The residue from the liquid-liquid extraction was dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of 20 m g/L. Separation was achieved on a Hypersil BDS C18 reverse phase LC system using a combination of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a 8/2 (v/v) mixture. Detection was achieved with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray interface. Daughter ions (m/z 225 and 340) of the danofloxacin generated by collision induced dissociation (CID) of the parent ion, m/z 358, were monitored for quantitation (LOQ 50 m g/kg). No interferences were found when enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were analysed by this method (Schneider et al,
APPRAISAL
Danofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with wide-spectrum antibacterial activity. It is used in the therapeutic treatment of respiratory disease in chickens, cattle and pigs.
The drug is well absorbed when administered parentally or orally. Both the parent drug as the major component and desmethyldanofloxacin in very small quantities were excreted in the faeces and the urine.
Danofloxacin was found to be metabolized in a quantitatively similar manner in rats, dogs, cattle, chickens and pigs along pathways predictable from studies reported for other quinolones. The parent drug, danofloxacin comprised a majority of the residues found in edible tissues following treatment of chickens, cattle and swine. The metabolite desmethyldanofloxacin was a major residue in the livers of the three species. No other metabolite was present in significant quantities.
Residue depletion studies using ^3H-labeled drug and unlabelled drug were carried out in cattle, pigs and chickens using the doses recommended for normal therapeutic treatment.
Cattle. ^3H-Danofloxacin was administered to mature cattle once daily by i.m. injection at 1.25 mg/kg body weight (BW) for 5 successive days. Total residues, unchanged danofloxacin and desmethyl metabolite were determined in edible tissues collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h after the last treatment. The highest concentrations of total residues (ca. 1000 m g/kg at 12 h after treatment and decreasing to ca. 200 m g/kg at 72 h with a half life t[½] of approximately 26 h) as measured by radioactivity, were found in the liver. Total residues depleted more rapidly in the other tissues where the half lives were; kidney, 14 h, muscle, 17 h and at the injection site (IS), 11 h. Analysis of the liver for danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin showed that whereas the parent drug comprised about 21-32% of the labeled residue, the metabolite proportion declined gradually from 40% at 12 hours to 14% at 72 h. At 48 h after dosing the total residue concentrations in the injection site
muscle were similar to those in muscle.
The depletion of unlabeled danofloxacin from cattle tissues was evaluated where five groups of six cattle each received a single daily im dose of danofloxacin at 1.25 mg/kg for five successive days. Muscle, liver, kidney, fat and injection site samples were obtained at 12, 36, 60, 84 and 120 h after the last injection and were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. The residues depleted at rates comparable to those of the total residues. At 5 days withdrawal, danofloxacin was measurable only in the liver (13 m g/kg) and kidney (5 m g/kg), and the level of the metabolite was below the assay quantification limit (10 m g/kg) in all tissues.
Pigs. The depletion of ^3H-danofloxacin from pig tissues was evaluated where five groups of four pigs each received a single daily intramuscular dose of danofloxacin at 1.25 mg/kg BW for five successive days. Muscle, liver, kidney, fat and injection site samples were obtained at 12, 24, 48, and 168 hours after the last injection and were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. The highest concentrations of radioactive substances were found in the liver (960 - 1021 m g/kg) and kidney (824-991 m g/kg) at 12 h, and these tissues continued to have the highest radioactive content for up to 7 days post-dosing. The depletion of radioactivity in tissues including the injection site was characterised by half lives of 22-24 h for muscle, fat and injection site, 41 h for kidney, and 72 h for liver. The contents of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin in the pooled liver samples were measured by an HPLC assay. At 12 h both compounds were present in
equal amounts but at later times (>48 h) the desmethyldanofloxacin was the more abundant (about 90%) residue.
The depletion of unlabeled danofloxacin was evaluated where five groups of four pigs each received a single daily intramuscular dose of danofloxacin at 1.25 mg/kg bw for three successive days. Muscle, liver, kidney, fat and injection site samples were obtained at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 days after the last injection and were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. The concentrations of danofloxacin depleted rapidly in all tissues, so that by the first sampling period at 2 days post dosing, danofloxacin was present in only very low concentrations (<40 m g/kg) and by 6 days post treatment, danofloxacin was not detectable in any tissue. The desmethyl metabolite was present in the liver (408-1065 m g/kg at 2 d and 192-255 m g/kg at 6 d) and concentrations in liver continued to decline over time and were still detectable at 18 days post-treatment (34-147 m g/kg).
Chickens. ^3H-Danofloxacin was administered in drinking water to 23 three-week-old chickens to achieve a targeted dose of 5.0 mg Danofloxacin/kg bw/day for 5 days. Birds were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after withdrawal of the treatment and the total residues in their edible tissues were measured. The highest concentrations of total residues were at 6 h and were consistently found in both the liver (457-850 m g/kg) and the kidney (291 - 641 m g/kg). The half lives were similar (9-11 h) for the total residues in liver, kidney and muscle and slightly longer (18 h) in skin/fat tissue. In pooled liver homogenates danofloxacin was the most abundant residue (47-61% of the total residues) at all withdrawal times and desmethyldanofloxacin was the major metabolite (13-20% of the total residues).
The depletion of unlabeled danofloxacin from chicken tissues was evaluated where danofloxacin mesylate soluble powder was administered in drinking water to 30 three-week-old chickens at 5.0 mg danofloxacin/kg bw/day for 3 days. Muscle, liver and skin/fat samples were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 hours after withdrawal and were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin. Danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin depleted rapidly from chicken tissue following drug withdrawal with liver always containing the highest concentrations of both danofloxacin and Desmethyldanofloxacin, 157-319 m g/kg and 35-193 m g/kg at 6 hours, respectively. All other tissues contained lower concentrations of danofloxacin than did the liver, while the metabolite, desmethyl-danofloxacin, was not found in tissues other than liver. The concentrations of danofloxacin declined in muscle and fat to <25 m g/kg at 36 h withdrawal. In muscle the maximum concentration of
danofloxacin was 91 m g/kg at 6h in one bird but by 18 h the residue was not measurable (<25 m g/kg). Skin/fat residues of parent drug were 61-235 m g/kg at 6 h which decreased to <25-41 m g/kg by 36 h. The concentrations of both parent drug and the metabolite in liver decreased rapidly so that at 36 h the concentration of the parent drug was 41 m g/kg and that of the metabolite <10 m g/kg.
The analytical methods submitted by the sponsor are suitable for their purpose. For routine monitoring purposes danofloxacin concentrations at the m g/kg level in cattle and poultry tissue can be determined by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection following an extraction using acid hydrolysis and solvent partition from tissue homogenates or fat. The assay has a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10 m g/kg and was linear between 10-500 m g/kg in liver, muscle, kidney, fat, and injection site muscle. Recovery of danofloxacin from all fortified tissues was near 100%. The accuracy of the method was between 99-103% with the precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, 2% or less. The method demonstrated chromatographic resolution from other fluoroquinolones including, desmethyldanofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, sarafloxacin, marbofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. A method to confirm the presence of danofloxacin in liver tissues used
HPLC combined with mass spectrometry.
Maximum Residue Limits
The following factors were used in establishing the MRLs.
1. The ADI is 0-1200 m g/60-kg person/day.
2. The marker residue is danofloxacin.
3. Desmethyldanofloxacin is ten times more toxic than the parent drug.
4. Only the toxicological activity of the parent drug and desmethyldanofloxacin are known. Therefore all the residues including the bound residues are assumed to be of toxicological concern and to have the same toxicity as parent drug
5. The target tissues are liver and muscle.
6. Desmethyldanofloxacin occurs only in the liver.
7. The danofloxacin and desmethyldanofloxacin content as a fraction (%) of total residues varies between tissues and species.

Dihydrostreptomycin/streptomycin

ADDENDUM
to the dihydrostreptomycin/streptomycin monograph
prepared by the 43rd meeting of the Committee and published in FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/8, Rome 1995
Streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin were evaluated by the Committee at its 43rd meeting in November 1994. The Committee proposed a temporary ADI for streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. Temporary MRL's of 500 m g/kg (muscle, liver, fat), 1000 m g/kg (kidney) and 200 m g/l (milk) were also recommended, expressed as the sum of streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. Insufficient data was available to support an MRL for eggs.
The following information on residues was requested by the Committee for evaluation in 1997.
1. An evaluation report or results of experimental studies on the metabolism of dihydrostreptomycin and streptomycin.
2. Data on residues of streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin in eggs.
3. Results of studies to determine the relationship between the antimicrobial activity of the residues and their concentration, as measured by specific chemical methods.
The purpose of this evaluation is to address these points.
Metabolism
The Committee at its 43rd meeting stated that "very little information is available on the metabolism of either streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin in farm animals; the drugs are probably not extensively metabolised". No subsequent experimental studies have been carried out to determine the metabolism of streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. Biotransformation studies, using radiolabelled streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin in laboratory animals, farm animals and possibly man using in vitro techniques (e.g. exposure of labeled streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin to gut flora) would involve extensive study. The sponsors suggest that biotransformation data on aminoglycosides are limited because of difficulties in obtaining radiolabeled material of sufficient purity and the lack of applicable separation methodologies and effective spectroscopic techniques. They also argue that if the parent compounds are little metabolised then only minor metabolites would be expected and it is
difficult to see how knowledge of the identity of such metabolites would contribute to a more informative safety assessment.
The sponsors have submitted an evaluation report on the metabolism of both drugs (Norbrook, 1996). Background pharmacokinetic data (absorption, distribution, excretion) on streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin are available for the oral and parenteral routes of administration in laboratory and farm animals and man. Literature searches (Medline 1966-1996; Embase 1974-1996), however, have hitherto failed to reveal any published data on the metabolism (biotransformation) of streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin.
Aminoglycosides as a class are reported not to be metabolised in humans (Pratt & Fekaty, 1986). Because of their high molecular weight unmetabolised streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin are unlikely to be absorbed from the gut following oral administration, e.g. 60-100% of an oral dose of streptomycin was excreted unchanged in the faeces of man (Dollery, 1991). Also if the aminoglycosides are not readily metabolised then the drugs should be excreted unchanged in the urine following parenteral administration, e.g. after parenteral administration of streptomycin 50-60% of a dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours in man (Anderson & Jewell, 1945). No data or references on the biotransformation of dihydrostreptomycin were provided.
Two other aminoglycosides, gentamicin and neomycin, were evaluated at the 43rd meeting of the Committee and evidence was given demonstrating that following radiolabeled studies these aminoglycosides were not metabolised in farm animals. Although various reviews make claims about the lack of biotransformation of aminoglycosides as a class following oral or parenteral administration, it is difficult to locate hard data on which most of these statements are based. One study was that using ^14C-neomycin in calves by Aschbacher & Feil (1994). Nevertheless, even in this study, unchanged parent compound was found present in kidney tissue and faeces, but no metabolites were identified in tissues or excreta. If biotransformation were to take place, one would expect metabolites to be formed mainly in the liver or kidney following parenteral administration and mainly in the intestine following oral administration.
Although there is no direct evidence showing whether the parent aminoglycoside or a metabolite is responsible for the two main forms ototoxicity (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity), mechanistic studies on nephrotoxicity would indicate involvement by a reactive oxygen species induced by the parent aminoglycoside rather than a direct action of a reactive metabolite of the aminoglycoside on the target organ (see review of Forge & Harpur, 1993).
Residues in Eggs
The sponsor does not have or intend to apply for a license to use the drugs in laying birds. Thus they have not submitted further information on residues in eggs. Nevertheless, the drugs are in preparations from other companies and could be used in laying birds.
Analytical Methods
The sponsors have submitted an HPLC method for dihydrostreptomycin (but not streptomycin) and determined the relationship between the antimicrobial activity of residues of dihydrostreptomycin and the concentration of the drug in fortified ovine liver and kidney tissues. The specific chemical (HPLC) assay for dihydrostreptomycin has an LOQ of 400 m g/kg (Norbrook, SOM No. CRD/DST/010).
Fortified ovine liver and kidney tissue samples (10 g) were prepared at two concentrations of dihydrostreptomycin (500 m g/kg and 1200 m g/kg) and assayed in parallel by both the HPLC assay and Norbrook's standard in-house microbiological assay (Norbrook, SOM No. MRD/DST/010) which has an LOQ of 400 m g/kg. The results are shown in Table 1.

The results of this experiment confirm that the results for fortified samples obtained, if based on antimicrobial activity, are equivalent to results obtained from a specific chemical assay.
The sponsors have developed an HPLC method for the measurement of dihydrostreptomycin in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of cattle, sheep and pigs. The tissue was deproteinised with perchloric acid and the liquid extract was placed onto a small solid phase column, washed with water and the dihydrostreptomycin eluted with phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The eluate was analysed by HPLC with post-column derivatisation and fluorescent detection.
The in-house validation was carried out using fortified tissues in the range 400 - 5000 m g/kg tissue. The accuracy of the method was measured by using replicates at 400 and 5000 m g/kg spikes. The LOQ was determined as 400 m g/kg for all tissues.
A summary of the in-house validation results is shown in Table 2.

The sponsors have carried out tissue residue studies in cattle, sheep and pigs for their penicillin/dihydrostreptomycin combination product, (PEN & STREP) using this HPLC method for dihydrostreptomycin. The results are given in Table 3 together with some results using the bioassay (microbiological) method.

HPLC LOQ = 400 m g/kg. In the bioassay the LOD was either 1000 or 100 m g/kg.
The results show that with this one preparation containing procaine penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin no residues >LOQ were found in the edible tissues except at the injection site. At the withdrawal times of 18 days or longer no residues were found by the bioassay method when similar experiments were carried out by this sponsor.
APPRAISAL
No new studies have been carried out on the metabolism of either streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin. An expert report was provided, however, that inducted:
1. Background pharmacokinetic information on the oral route of administration to animals and humans that suggest there is little metabolism of either drug.
2. Aminoglycosides as a class of antimicrobials are not readily metabolized in humans. In particular studies using radio-labeled neomycin in cattle, no metabolites other than parent drug were identified in tissues or excreta.
3. Both streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin are unlikely to be absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract because of their high molecular weight, and they are excreted unchanged in faeces.
4. When administered parenterally to humans, most of the streptomycin was excreted unchanged in the urine.
Based on the expert report the Committee recommended that further information on metabolism is not essential for the following reasons:
1. Extrapolation from limited studies with other aminoglycosides in farm animals supports a strong indication that both streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin remain unmetabolised in farm animals and humans.
2. Additional studies may not yield substantial new information.
The sponsor has not submitted further information on residues in eggs because it does not have or intend to use the drugs in laying birds. Therefore, the Committee is not in a position to recommend an MRL for eggs.
An HPLC method was developed for the measurement of dihydrostreptomycin in muscle, liver, kidney and fat of cattle, sheep and pigs. The extracts were analysed by HPLC with post-column derivatisation and fluorescent detection. The method evaluation was carried out using fortified tissues with concentrations of 400-5000 m g/kg tissue. The method was linear over this range and the accuracy of the method was acceptable. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was determined as 400 m g/kg for all tissues. There was no interference from streptomycin but the specificity towards other aminoglycosides and antibiotics was not determined.
The HPLC method and the antimicrobial assay were compared using sheep liver and kidney tissues fortified with dihydrostreptomycin at 500 m g/kg and 1200 m g/kg. The results for the two methods were equivalent. No comparison of the methods was made using incurred tissues.
In treated animals residues were below the LOQ (400 m g/kg) in the edible tissues of cattle, sheep and pigs at 14 days or thereafter following daily injections over a three day period at the recommended dosing (10 mg dihydrostreptomycin sulphate/kg body weight) of a preparation of dihydrostreptomycin combined with procaine penicillin. Similar results were observed in earlier studies when an antimicrobial assay was used. Residues were found in tissues collected from the injection site of cattle and sheep at 14 and 18 days after dosing but were below the LOQ at 21 and 28 days post dosing, respectively. Residues at the injection site in cattle and sheep showed broad variability at 14 and 18 days following treatment. At 14 days post treatment residues in cattle were <400-982 m g/kg and at 18 days, <400-1140 m g/kg. In sheep, at 14 days residues were 417-982 m g/kg and at 18 days, <400-691 m g/kg. No residues were found at the injection sites in pigs sacrificed at 14 and 18 days
after dosing.
Conclusions:
1. Additional information on the metabolism of dihydrostreptomycin and streptomycin is not required.
2. No MRLs can be recommended for eggs because additional data was not made available to the Committee for residues in eggs.
3. The HPLC analytical method is satisfactory for monitoring for residues of dihydrostreptomycin but has not been tested for streptomycin. Therefore, the method can not be used to regulate the MRL which is set as the sum of the two drugs.
The Committee affirmed maintaining the temporary MRLs recommended by its 43rd meeting. The sponsor was asked to supply the following information for evaluation in 1999:
- Validation of the HPLC assay to measure residues of streptomycin.
- Studies to determine whether the HPLC and bioassay methods give similar results for residues of both drugs using tissues with incurrent residues.

RESIDUES IN FOOD AND THEIR EVALUATION
CONDITIONS OF USE
General
Antiparasite, tick development inhibitor, insecticide, insect/acarine development inhibitor. Use in cattle is for the control of Boophilus microplus. The principle mode of action of fluazuron on the cattle-tick is by inhibition of chitin incorporation into tick cuticle. The inhibition is presumably against enzymes involved in the final stages of chitin synthesis (Kemp et al., 1990).
Dosage
The product is applied in two bands on each side of the spine between the shoulders and the rump by means of an applicator at the dose levels of 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. In most situations the control can be achieved with a single treatment per season. When necessary, depending on the climatic region, an additional treatment is recommended after an interval of 3 to 6 months. The difference in dosing is due to the different sensitivity of the pest strains in different countries.
PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM
Pharmacokinetics
Rat
In rats, a daily dose of 0.5 mg/kg b.w. of [U-^14C] Cl-Phenyl labelled fluazuron was administered by stomach tube for 7 consecutive days. At 24 hours after final dose, approximately 60% of the administered radioactivity were absorbed (Schulze-Aurich, 1992). The metabolic pathway of fluazuron is shown in Figure 1.
Radiolabelled fluazuron and metabolites were released by first order kinetics with a half life of 13 days in rats, orally administered 0.5 mg/kg b.w. for 7 consecutive days. A total of 60% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine and faeces during one week of repeated exposure and a subsequent one-week withdrawal period.
Based on the faeces metabolite pattern, it is estimated that about two-thirds of the dose was metabolized and one-third was eliminated unchanged. The metabolism is mainly by cleavage of the benzoyl ureido bridge. Hydroxylation of the metabolite at the phenyl ring leads to metabolite which was eliminated mainly with the faeces. The metabolism in rats proceeds by cleavage of the urea moiety, followed by hydroxylation in position 6 of the phenyl ring leading to 3-[3-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyloxy)-4-chloro-6-hydroxyphenyl]urea. The primarily formed cleavage product 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid is partly conjugated with glycine to 2,6-difluorohippuric acid. The primary route of elimination was through the faeces as shown in Table 1.

Figure 1. Proposed Metabolic Pathway of Fluazuron in Rats
Cattle
Oral application of 2.0 mg/kg b.w. of fluazuron gives rise to more rapid absorption and maintains higher level of fluazuron in the bloodstream of cattle than a dermal treatment at the same dose level (Bull and Strong, 1994). The compound distributed to the tissues such as muscle, kidney, liver, lung and brain but deposited preferentially in the fat. When the radiolabelled fluazuron was administered subcutaneously to cattles at 1.5 mg/kg b.w., the mean maximum plasma level of total radioactivity was reached in 48 hours post dose. The radioactivity was absorbed slowly from the site of injection. Half life of the radioactivity in the blood was around 78 days (Cameron et al., 1992).
Fluazuron was applied to various species of cattle by single or repeated administration of pour-on in two strips along the backline from the shoulder to the loins. There were relatively consistent range of ratio for residues in plasma and fat as shown in Table 2. When subcutaneous injection was administered to male cattle at 1.5 mg/kg b.w., elimination of unchanged fluazuron occurred via bile and faeces (23%), whereas metabolized products were excreted via urine (1%). More than 96% of the radioactive compounds present in the faeces were extractable. The major fraction (62-81%) of the radioactivity present in the extract, was identified as unchanged compound.

The parent compound and/or its metabolites had a high affinity for fat. There were persistent depot of the compound at the injection site.
There is a transfer and accumulation of fluazuron in calves suckling cows which have been treated with fluazuron pour-on (Strong and Swindale, 1993).
Metabolism in Food Animals
Radiolabelled fluazuron was given as a single subcutaneous injection to cattle at 1.5 mg/kg b.w. The extent of metabolism in cattle was found to be lower than in rats. The TLC radiograms from cattle showed less radioactive spots than those from rats. In all tissues, and at all time points, unchanged fluazuron was the only metabolite, accounting for more than 90% of the total residues (Schulze-Aurich, 1992a). The nature of metabolites eliminated with urine, faeces and bile were more polar than the parent compound. Following single topical administration of radiolabelled fluazuron pour-on preparation, unchanged fluazuron was almost the only radioactive compound detected. In the faeces, the parent compound accounted for 92% of the radioactivity of the investigated samples.
TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
Radiolabelled Residue Depletion Studies
Twelve steers were treated with a single s.c. dose of ^14C-fluazuron at a dose level of 1.5 mg/kg b.w. Three animals were sacrificed at each of the sampling times of 2 days, and 2, 6 and 16 weeks post-dosing. Fluazuron residue levels in fat were consistently about 10 times higher than those in liver and kidney. Fat contains the highest residue levels at all times. The distribution of the total residues (mg/kg) in edible tissues for all of the treatment groups are shown in Table 3 (Cameron et al., 1992).

Results of four pour-on formulation studies in which fluazuron was applied in two strips along the backline from the shoulder to the rump using a calibrated plastic syringe, are summarized in Figures 2 and 3, and Table 5 (Strong and Bull, 1992a; 1992b; 1992c; 1992d). Residues in these studies were determined using an HPLC-UV method with a LOD of 0.02 mg/kg for muscle, liver and kidney, and 0.01 mg/kg for fat. These studies are consistent with previous studies showing that fluazuron does not accumulate in tissues. However, the residue levels rise with increasing doses.

Strong and Bull (1993) applied three treatments each at intervals of 12 weeks applying two strips along the backline from the shoulder to the rump. Six weeks after each treatment, fat samples were collected from each of the six animals. The mean fat levels 6 weeks after each treatment were 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 mg/kg, respectively in the 2 mg/kg dose-group and 3.0, 2.4 and 2.1 mg/kg, respectively, in the 4 mg/kg dose-group. This study did not suggest accumulation following the dosing regimen.
Cows with calves in utero at the time of the first treatment were treated three times with a pour-on formulation at 12 weekly intervals at dose rates of either 2 or 4 mg a.i./kg (Bull, 1995a). The calves, born 6 weeks after the first treatment, had subcutaneous fat biopsy samples taken 6 weeks after their respective cows received their second and third treatments. In the second and third year of treatments, the calves received direct treatments with the pour-on formulation at the same rates and treatment intervals as their mothers had received the previous year. Again biopsy samples of fat were collected 6 weeks after each treatment. Peak concentrations of fluazuron in the fat occurred in the spring of each year of treatment. At the end of the three years of three treatments per year no accumulation of residues of fluazuron occurred in the fat of the cattle. At the treatment rates of 2 and 4 mg a.i./kg the initial maximum residues in the fat of 12 weeks old calves were 4.2
and 6.8 mg/kg, respectively, and after three years of applications, cattle (now approximately 2.5 years old), the maximum levels were 1.6 and 2.3 mg/kg, respectively.
Bound Residues/Bioavailability
The majority of the radiolabeled residues were extractable with mild solvents. In cattle, in all tissues at all time points, unchanged fluazuron accounted for more than 90% of the residues.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR RESIDUES IN TISSUES
Four methods were described which allow for the determination and quantification of residues of parent fluazuron in bovine muscle, liver, kidney, and fat. One method that was presented (Bull, 1995b; Shume, 1990) involves cattle tissues being extracted with acetonitrile. From an aliquot of filtered extract the analyte is partitioned into methylene chloride in the presence of acidified sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved in a mixture of hexane/acetone. The solution is cleaned up by chromatography on deactivated basic alumina. The analyte is eluted with a mixture of hexane/acetone and the elute evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in the mobile phase and quantitated by reverse phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using UV-detection at 260 nm. The overall recovery of the method was 95 ± 5%. Levels of quantification of this method were 0.01 mg/kg for fat and 0.02 mg/kg for muscle, liver and
kidney.
In another method (Lanter, 1990a; 199 la), animal tissues were extracted with acetonitrile. From an aliquot of the centrifuged extract, the analyte is partitioned into a mixture of n-hexane/diethyl ether in presence of saturated sodium chloride solution and hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved in n-hexane. The solution is cleaned up by solid phase extraction on a Bond Elut^R cyanopropyl cartridge. The analyte is eluted with a mixture of n-hexane/diethyl ether and the eluate evaporated to dryness. The residue is quantitated by HPLC using UV-detection at 270 nm and column switching technique. The overall mean recovery was 92 ± 7% (n = 27). Levels of quantification of this method were 0.01 mg/kg for fat and 0.02 mg/kg for muscle, liver and kidney, respectively (Ciba-Geigy, 1990a).
APPRAISAL
Fluazuron had not been previously evaluated by the Committee. Fluazuron is an insect growth regulator that belongs to the chemical class of benzoylphenyl urea derivatives that inhibits chitin synthesis. It is indicated for the use on beef cattle for the control of the tick Boophilus microplus. Fluazuron is applied as a pour on at the recommended dose of 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. in Australia and in Latin American countries, respectively. The difference in dosing is due to the different sensitivity of the Boophilus microplus strains in these two regions. A second treatment is frequently recommended after an interval of 3 to 6 months. However, current labeling of the commercial product permits a maximum of three treatments per year.
Table 6 shows the distribution of residues of fluazuron in the edible tissues of cattle in the studies performed by Cameron et al, 1992 and Schulze-Aurich, J., 1992a.

The residue levels in fat were consistently about 10 times those in liver and kidney. Maximum residue levels were reached in all tissues at 2 days after drug withdrawal. Fat contained the highest amounts of residues at all sampling times. The residue levels in fat samples from the site of administration of the pour-on formulation were no higher than in fat samples taken from other sites.
Five residue depletion studies in cattle treated with a pour-on formulation of fluazuron were considered. In the first and second studies, fluazuron was administered once, at a dose of 2 and 3 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. In the remaining studies, the drug was administered as follows: 2 mg/kg of body weight repeated after 9 weeks; 3 mg/kg of body weight, repeated after 9 weeks; 2 or 4 mg/kg of body weight, repeated after 12 and 24 weeks. All these studies confirmed that the highest levels of residues occurred in fat. Residue levels were similar from 6 to 16 weeks after treatment. Table 7 shows the distribution of residues in tissues of cattle given two doses of 3 mg/kg of body weight at an interval of 9 weeks. This dosing regimen exceeds that recommended for therapeutic use. The results of this study are consistent with those of previous residue depletion studies using multiple-dose regimens, in which there was no evidence of bioaccumulation of the drug, but residue
levels were shown to increase in a dose-dependent manner.

Data on the depletion of fluazuron residues in fat from studies in cattle indicate that the residue concentrations increase significantly as the body-fat content decreases. Therefore, these studies suggest that the MRiLs for fat should be higher than those derived solely on the basis of traditional residue depletion studies.
Fluazuron residues can be measured by HPLC with UV-detection. The method has been used for the analysis of residues in tissues of animals following treatment with fluazuron as well as in tissues fortified with the drug. The method has limits of quantification of 0.02 mg/kg in muscle, liver and kidney and 0.01 mg/kg in fat. The recoveries in muscle, liver, kidney and fat were 107 ± 7, 94 ± 9, 102 ± 8, and 94 ± 5%, respectively.
Maximum Residue Limits
In recommending MRLs, the Committee took into account the following factors:
- An ADI of 0-40 m g per kg of body weight was established. This would result in a maximum daily intake of 2400 m g for a 60-kg person.
- The marker residue is the parent drug.
- The parent drug accounts for at least 80% of the total residues in all tissues.
- Fat and liver or kidney are recommended as the appropriate target tissues.
- Suitable analytical methods are available for monitoring the proposed MRLs.
On the basis of the maximum observed residues in cattle treated with fluazuron in accordance with good practice in the use of veterinary drugs, the Committee recommended MRLs in cattle of 200 m g/kg for muscle, 500 m g/kg for liver and kidney and 7000 m g/kg for fat, expressed as parent drug. From these values the theoretical maximum daily intake of fluazuron residues is 606 m g (Table 8).

RESIDUES IN FOOD AND THEIR EVALUATION
CONDITIONS OF USE
Flumequine is a first generation drug of the fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics. It is used primarily for the treatment of enteric infections in domestic species. Flumequine also has a limited use in man for the treatment of urinary tract infections.
PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM
Pharmacokinetics
Four calves were administered [^14C]-flumequine intramuscularly. An initial injection of 12 mg/kg was followed by 9 further 12-hourly injections of 6 mg/kg. Urine, faeces and blood were collected during the treatment and after the final administration. Animals were sacrificed at 6, 24, 72 and 168 hours after the last treatment. The plasma level after the first administration rose steadily to reach a plateau at 2 hours post dosing (5.2-7.4 mg equiv/L) and then fell to 1.3-2.6 mg equiv/L immediately prior to the next injection. Steady state conditions, in which a consistent profile was achieved, was attained rapidly and unchanged by the 9^th dose. After withdrawal of medication, the plasma radioactivity decreased slowly to about 0.2 mg equiv/L on the 7^th day. Whole blood levels were akin to but lower than those in plasma. Between 48-63% of administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine (47-61% in the first 24 hours) while faecal elimination accounted for a further
21-41%. Total recovery of radioactivity amounted to 85-96% at 168 h post dosing (Allan et al., 1995).
In a second experiment, all the parameters of the first experiment were kept the same with the exception that the administration of [^14C]-drug was by the oral route. The plasma radioactivity profile parallelled that of i.m. experiment but values were lower. The plasma level after the first administration reached a plateau at 0.5 hours post dosing (2.5-5.8 mg equiv/L) and then fell to 0.8-1.5 mg equiv/L immediately prior to the next dose. Steady state conditions were attained rapidly and remained unchanged by the 9^th dose. Whole blood levels were akin to but lower than those in plasma. Between 52-73% of administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine (49-70% in the first 24 hours) while faecal elimination accounted for a further 21-36%. Total recovery of radioactivity amounted to 52-73% at 168 h post dosing (Allan et al., 1995).
Residues in plasma and various tissues were measured after the last administration for both i.m. and oral routes. Results of these studies are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in which the LOQs were 0.05 mg equiv/kg for liver, kidney and muscle, 0.14 mg equiv/kg for fat and 0.01 mg equiv/kg for plasma.
It can be concluded that flumequine is both rapidly absorbed after oral and intramuscular administration and most was rapidly eliminated within 168 h post-dosing.

Metabolism
After enzymic hydrolysis, the two major substances isolated from kidney, muscle, fat, urine and faeces were either flumequine (A) or 7-hyroxyflumequine (B), suggesting that the major metabolite in all of these analytical matrices were the glucuronides of flumequine (C) or 7-hyroxyflumequine (D). The distribution and amount of identified metabolites of flumequine after enzymic hydrolysis in all matrices studied is shown in Table 1 (Allan et al., 1995).

Specific Studies of the Metabolism of Flumequine in Calf Liver
In initial metabolism experiments discussed above, the efficiency of extraction of radioactivity from liver was low. It also decreased with time from about 60% at 6 h after withdrawal of drug to only 38% at 168 h post dosing. Extraction efficiency was markedly improved (>90%) after protease digestion but the resulting radiolabelled profile was not resolvable and the exact nature of the major metabolite at later time points could not be determined. A series of experiments were carried out to resolve this problem.
Metabolites were isolated from calf liver at different times after the last drug administration by extraction with both ethyl acetate and methanol. The efficiency of recovery of radioactivity was not significantly affected by enzymic deconjugation for early time points (6 and 24 h) but an increasing fraction of radioactivity was recovered in the ethyl acetate layer after deconjugation with Helix pomatia as time increased. About 20% of the isolated metabolite radioactivity could be ascribed to conjugated metabolites (Mas-Chamberlin et al., 1995).
Acceptable recoveries of the residual radioactivity remaining in tissue after solvent extraction were achieved using pronase digestion prior to repetition of the extraction process.
Radioprofiling of peaks obtained from HPLC identified, in addition to (A) and (B), 13 other metabolites (m1-m13). However, only (A), (B) and metabolite ml contributed significantly to total extractable radioactivity and ml was the major metabolite in liver associated with radioactivity at times of 24 h and after. Table 2 and 3 show results of metabolite distribution before and after pronase digestion, respectively.

The concentration of flumequine decreased rapidly and was not observable after 24 h. 7-Hydoxyflumequine decreased somewhat more slowly until 72 h. Metabolite ml became dominant after 24 h in both non-digested and protein-digested samples. The chemical structure of this metabolite has not been determined and the suggestion that it could be an enzyme (H. pomatia) resistant glucuronide or sulfate has not been discounted.
TISSUE RESIDUE DEPLETION STUDIES
Cattle
Flumequine was administered twice daily by i.m. injection to 20 calves, 18 weeks old and weighing 192±5 kg, for 5 days (first dose of 12 mg/kg bw followed by doses of 6 mg/kg bw). Blood samples were collected before sacrifice and groups of 4 animals were sacrificed at 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after the last dose. Concentrations of flumequine, measured in kidney, liver, muscle and fat are shown in Table 4 (Caizerques et al., 1995a).
It was concluded that flumequine was rapidly absorbed with highest residue concentrations occurring in kidney. Flumequine could be successfully monitored for 3 days following withdrawal of medication.

Fish
Flumequine was administered as an oral premix on 5 consecutive days to 2 groups of 200 trout at 7.4°C or 16.4°C, respectively, at a rate of 12 mg/kg bw/day divided in two administrations at intervals of 12 hours. Concentrations of flumequine and 7-hyroxyflumequine, measured in muscle/skin in natural proportions by a validated HPLC method, are shown in Table 9. Expert conclusions noted that the absence of 7-hyroxyflumequine in any sample supported the in vivo study which demonstrated the absence of metabolism of flumequine by fish microsomes. This observation is clearly based on the assumption that flumequine is metabolised in fish and all mammals in the same manner. There were no residues of flumequine 14 days after withdrawal of medication at both study temperatures (Caizergues et al., 1995c).

METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR RESIDUES IN TISSUES
A routine high performance liquid chromatographic method for flumequine and its metabolite 7-hydroxyflumequine using fluorescence detection was used to obtain data presented in the residue depletion studies above. Chromatography was performed after clean up by liquid-liquid extraction. The performance of the method in terms of linearity, accuracy, repeatability, quantification and lower limits of detection was carried out in house. The specificity of the method was not checked against some other quinolone antibiotics, except in sheep (Sanders and Delmas, 1995a). No formal interlaboratory studies have been performed to test reproducibility. This method is probably suitable for regulatory purposes if properly validated. Some methods, previously reviewed for oxolinic acid (Wells, 1995), have also been applied to flumequine.
APPRAISAL
Flumequine is well absorbed when administered orally or parenterally and is excreted in the urine and faeces as the glucuronide conjugates of the parent drug and 7-hydroxyflumequine. In a study with ^14C-flumequine in calves, 86-99% of the radioactivity in kidney, muscle and fat was extractable and the only metabolites found were flumequine and 7-hydroxyflumequine. Flumequine comprised 50-98% of the total residues exception calf liver. Calf liver contained additional unidentified residues of which a new metabolite, ml, represented the major single metabolite 24 hours after the last dose and at all subsequent time points. At 24 hours flumequine comprised approximately 25% of total residues in calf liver. The metabolite ml, which exhibited no antimicrobial activity, was present in both free and protein bound fractions. Bound residues accounted for about 20% of total radioactivity at all time points after 24 hours. The major residue found in the edible tissues of sheep, pigs
and chickens was parent drug together with minor amounts of the 7-hydroxy-metabolite. The only detected residue in trout was the parent drug.
Flumequine was administered orally to 16 calves. The initial dose of 12 mg/kg bw was followed by 9 doses of 6 mg/kg bw at 12-hour intervals. Four animals were sacrificed at each time points of 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after the last treatment. Highest levels of flumequine were found in kidney, 0.82-2.77 mg/kg at 24 hours after the last treatment, declining to 0.13-0.33 mg/kg at 72 hours. Flumequine levels in liver declined from 0.7-1.47 mg/kg at 24 hours to 0.07-0.29 mg/kg at 72 hours after the final dose. Levels in muscle declined from 0.18-0.43 mg/kg at 24 hours to 0.06-0.17 mg/kg at 72 hours while fat levels declined from 0.15-1.04 mg/kg at 24 hours to 0.08-0.15 mg/kg at 72 hours.
In parallel studies with non-radioactive drug, calves, sheep and pigs were administered flumequine orally over five consecutive days. Calves and sheep were dosed initially with 12 mg/kg bw followed by nine doses of 6 mg/kg bw treatments at 12-hour intervals. Pigs received an initial dose of 15 mg/kg bw followed by nine doses of 7.5 mg/kg bw at intervals of 12 hours. Flumequine residues were monitored in tissues over time after the final dose with four animals being sacrificed at each time point. Table 10 shows the maximum flumequine residues found in each tissue at each time point for all three animal species. Residue values are corrected for recovery.
Flumequine was administered ad libitum in drinking water to 36 broilers for 5 days at a rate of 12 mg/kg bw/day. Groups of 6 animals were sacrificed at 6, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the last administration. After 6 hours, maximum flumequine residues in kidney, liver, muscle and fat/skin were 3.55, 3.00, 1.81 and 1.10 mg/kg, respectively. By 48 hours after withdrawal of medication, maximum values in these tissues had fallen to 0.16, 0.19, 0.17 and 0.12 mg/kg, respectively, and at 96 hours flumequine could not be detected in liver and kidney. In muscle and skin/fat the levels of flumequine were below the LOQ (0.025 mg/kg for muscle and 0.05 mg/kg for skin/fat) or were below the LOD (0.01 mg/kg for muscle and 0.015 mg/kg for skin/fat).
Flumequine was administered as an oral premix on 5 consecutive days to 2 groups of 200 trout maintained at about 7°C and 16°C, respectively, at a rate of 12 mg/kg bw/day divided in two administrations at intervals of 12 hours. Concentrations of flumequine were measured in muscle/skin, in natural proportions. One day after the last drug treatment, the maximum residue concentrations of flumequine found in the muscle/skin of the low temperature group were 8.58 mg/kg, declining to 1.49 mg/kg on the 4^th day following drug withdrawal. Maximum residue levels in the high temperature group at the same times following withdrawal of drug were 3.65 and 0.08 mg/kg, respectively. There were no residues of flumequine 14 days after withdrawal of medication at both study temperatures.

A high performance liquid chromatographic method for flumequine and its metabolite, 7-hydroxyflumequine, using fluorescence detection was used to obtain data presented in the residue depletion studies above. Chromatography was performed after clean up by liquid-liquid extraction. The method, which was used only in the sponsor's laboratory, was acceptable in terms of linearity, accuracy, repeatability, quantification and lower limits of detection. The specificity of the method as used in sheep tissues was checked against a wide range of related quinolone antimicrobials which were found to interfere with the 7-hydroxyflumequine analysis, but not with flumequine determination. Limits of quantification were 0.1 mg/kg in chicken liver and kidney, 0.05 mg/kg for the liver, kidney and fat of calves, skin/fat of chicken, all pig tissues, and skin/muscle of trout, 0.025 mg/kg in calf and chicken muscle and 0.005 mg/kg in all sheep tissues.
Maximum Residue Limits
In calculating MRL values for flumequine, the following factors were considered:
· An ADI of 0-30 m g/kg, based on a toxicological end-point, was established by JECFA. This will yield a daily intake of 0-1800 m g/kg for a 60-kg person.
· The parent drug was selected as the marker residue.
· Muscle and kidney were proposed as target tissues. For practical reasons, however, liver is the proposed target tissue for chickens in place of kidney.
· Based on data in calves only, non-extractable residues were 20 percent of the total residues.
· In calf muscle, kidney and fat, parent drug was approximately 80% of the extractable residues.
· The 7-hydroxyflumequine and unknown metabolite, ml, comprised 80% of the radioactivity in calf liver after 168 hours.
· There were no data provided on the amount of parent drug as a percentage of total residues in sheep, chickens, pigs or trout.
· In cattle muscle, kidney and fat, the parent drug consisted of 50 percent of the total residues. For liver tissue, parent drug consisted of approximately 25 percent of the total residues.
· No data were provided for milk or eggs.
The Committee recommended MRLs for flumequine of 500 m g/kg for cattle muscle, 1000 m g/kg for liver, 3000 m g/kg for kidney and 1000 m g/kg for fat, expressed as parent drug.
In the absence of data on the contribution of parent drug to total residues in sheep, chickens, pigs and trouts, the Committee recommended temporary MRLs of 500 m g/kg for muscle (for trouts including normal proportions of skin), expressed as parent drug. For the same reason temporary MRLs of 1000 m g/kg for liver, 3000 m g/kg for kidney and 1000 m g/kg for fat, expressed as parent drug, were recommended for sheep, chickens and pigs. No MRLs were recommended for milk and eggs.
From these values for the MRLs the calculated theoretical maximum daily intake of flumequine residues would be 1100 m g per day (Table 11).

ADDENDUM
to the Moxicectin residue monographs prepared by the 45th and 47th meetings of the Committee and published in the FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 41/8, Rome 1996, and Food and Nutrition Paper 41/9, Rome 1997, respectively
Introduction
Moxidectin was evaluated for the first time at the 45th meeting in cattle, sheep and red deer, and further evaluated at the 47th meeting for residues in sheep based on a study subsequent to the original submission by the sponsor. Recommended MRL's for cattle, sheep and deer at the 45th meeting were 500 m g/kg in fat, 100 m g/kg in liver, 20 m g/kg in muscle and 50 m g/kg in kidney, expressed as parent drug. The MRL's for deer were temporary.
The sponsors provided new data at the 47th meeting on a large sheep study indicating that the residues in sheep muscle could exceed the recommended MRL in muscle if the recommended dosing schedule for sarcoptic mange was used. The new study indicated that residues persisted for at least 50 days. In the submission for the 45th meeting of the Committee, residues of moxicectin were not measurable (<10 m g/kg) in sheep muscle at 28 days. The new study measured the residues of moxicectin in muscle, liver, kidney and at the injection sites (data on fat was submitted to the 45th meeting of the Committee) at various times following two treatments of moxicectin 1.0% injectable solution, ten days apart, at the recommended rate of 0.2 mg moxidectin/kg body weight.
Based on the new data submitted to the 47th meeting, three pertinent conclusions emerged from the sheep study:
- the residues in muscle exceeded the MRL recommended at the 45th meeting (the maximum value was 63 m g/kg at 10 days post dosing but at 20-40 days no value exceeded 40 m g/kg even when two doses were administered);
- the residue concentrations in liver, kidney and fat did not exceed the recommended MRL's; and
- there were very high concentrations of residues at the injection sites.
The residues in ovine muscle compared with non-detectable concentrations in bovine and deer muscle is probably due to the higher fat content in sheep muscle and the lipophilic nature of moxidectin. Based on the new, larger sheep study the Committee recommended an MRL of 50 m g/kg for sheep muscle.
The tenth Session of the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods requested that the 48th Session of the Expert Committee reassesses the MRL for cattle muscle to determine whether the MRL's for sheep and cattle muscle tissue might be harmonized and further, to consider the approved use of multiple dosing either by injection or by pour-on applications. New cattle studies using approved multiple dosing had been submitted by the sponsor for consideration at the 48th meeting of the Committee.
SUMMARY OF RADIOLABEL AND RESIDUE STUDIES FROM THE 45TH AND 47TH MEETINGS
Radiolabel Studies
In a small study, three Hereford steers received a single subcutaneous injection of ^14C-moxidectin at 0.2 mg/kg of body weight. One control steer was sacrificed at 6 days post dosing and the treated steers were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 28 days post dosing. Total ^14C-residues were determined in all samples. The total radioactivity recovered in the samples collected accounted for approximately 73, 71 and 77% of the administered dose at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. Residues were distributed as follows for the three post dosing periods: 0.8, 1.8 and 3.0% in urine; 32.2, 41.3 and 58.1% in feces; 29.8, 17.6, and 11.6% in the carcass; and 9.9, 10.0 and 4.2% in all other components sampled. These data demonstrate that the major route of excretion of the radiolabelled material is in the feces. The highest concentration of moxicectin equivalents were found in fat. Half-lives for clearance of total residues from tissues were estimated for back and abdominal fat, kidney, liver
and loin muscle. The percentage of extractable residues in abdominal and back fat and at injection site was greater than 95%; in liver, kidney and muscle more than 90% of the total radiolabel was extractable. These results identify fat as the target tissue, and that there is no bioaccumulation of residues in tissues. Results are summarized in Table 1 (FAO 41/8).
Moxidectin was the only significant component in both omental and back fat, and accounted for >75% of the residue. No single metabolite contributed more than 5% of the total residue in fat. Moxidectin accounted for 39, 55 and 39% of the residues, respectively, in liver, kidney and muscle. Total ^14C-moxidectin residues in excreta indicated feces was the primary route of excretion and moxidectin accounted for 51% of the residue.

In a larger study, four groups of three beef type steers were administered a single subcutaneous injection of ^3H-moxidectin at a dose of approximately 0.4 mg/kg b.w. (two times recommended dose). Total residues were determined at 7, 14, 28 and 49 days post treatment. Mean values as moxidectin equivalents are shown in Table 2 (FAO 41/8).

In another small study where six steers were administered a single topical dose of ^14C-moxidectin at 0.5 mg/kg b.w. groups of three animals each were sacrificed at 2 and 14 days post treatment. Total residues as mean m g/kg moxidectin equivalents at day 2 and 14, respectively, were 8 and 113 in omental fat; 4 and 55 in back fat; 3 and 12 in liver; <2 and 8 in kidney; and <2 and <3 in muscle. The radioactive residue profiles were qualitatively similar for all tissues. The study concluded that the results of this metabolism study demonstrated that the metabolic fate of moxidectin administered to steers topically as a pour-on solution was qualitatively similar to that administered subcutaneously, although the residues are lower following pour-on treatment. In both cases, fat is the target tissue, with declining residues in liver, kidney and muscle, respectively.
Elimination half-lives for each tissue using simple semi-logarithmic linear regression analysis of data for residues at day 7 and later are shown in Table 3 for cattle and sheep for various formulations.

Unlabeled Residue Depletion Studies
In the original submission by the sponsor one study was reported for residues of unlabeled moxidectin in cattle following a 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneous treatment and two studies following a 0.5 mg/kg pour-on treatment (FNP 41/8). Residues were reported for edible tissues and the injection site. The upper 99% confidence limit (CL) for residues in fat were calculated. Data in muscle tissue were not reported because most results were below the limit of quantification of 10 m g/kg. Results are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.
The main points of these residue studies in cattle were:
1. The residues were always highest in fat with little difference between omental and back fat. Residues in liver tissue are higher than in muscle tissue.
2. Fat was the recommended target tissue and parent drug the marker residue.
3. Residues were higher when moxidectin was administered subcutaneously.
4. Moxidectin was always the major residue constituent, representing about 40-70% of the total residues in liver, kidney and muscle tissue, and about 75-95% in fat.
5. The percentage of moxidectin in the total residues did not change significantly with time.

Supplemental New Studies on Multiple Dose Treatments
Two multiple dose treatment studies in cattle were submitted by the sponsor. In the subcutaneous multiple injection study, 45 Angus crossbred feeder steers were allocated to seven groups. Three animals were assigned to the non-medicated control group (Group 1) and seven animals each were assigned to the six medicated groups (Groups 2-7). Cattle in Groups 2 through 5 received subcutaneous injections of moxidectin at 0.2 mg/kg b.w. on days 0, 28, 56, and 84. Withdrawal periods for Groups 2-5 were 14, 21, 28 and 35 days, respectively. Cattle in Groups 6 and 7 received a single subcutaneous injection at 0.2 mg/kg b.w. on day 84 of the experiment followed by 14- and 35-day withdrawals, respectively. Loin muscle and back fat samples from six animals in each group were analyzed for residues of moxidectin. For the non-medicated control animals, loin muscle and back fat were collected from two animals when the Group 2 (14-day withdrawal) animals were sacrificed and the remaining
animal in Group 1 was sacrificed when Group 5 (35-day withdrawal) animals were sacrificed. Only one muscle sample in Group 2 (13 m g/kg) of the study had residues above the 10 m g/kg limit of quantification. Control animals had no detectable moxidectin residues. Residues were not recovery corrected. Results are summarized in Table 7.

Based on the 14- and 35-day withdrawal periods data, residue levels in fat, following the multiple dose administration, were approximately 85-90% higher than after a single dose, based on the 99% upper confidence limits. Comparable values were observed in liver tissue based on the 99% upper confidence limits.
The second study employed multiple treatment with a 0.5% solution of moxidectin as pour-on formulation. Fifty-eight Hereford mixed sex cattle were selected for the trial. In the trial, an additional eight animals were held as reserves. The control group (Group 1) consisted of three animals, while treatment Groups 2 through 7 contained five animals each. Group 8 containing three animals served as a second set of untreated controls. Groups 9 through 12 had three animals each and Groups 13 and 14 had five animals each. Groups 2 through 7 were treated with moxidectin pour-on on days 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84 using the 0.5% solution at 1 ml/10 kg bw (0.5 mg/kg b.w.).
Groups 9 through 14 were treated at days 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84 with moxidectin pour-on using a 0.5% medicated dose at twice the recommended dose (1.0 mg/kg b.w.). Withholding times for Groups 2 through 7 were 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days, respectively. Similarly, withholding times for Groups 9 through 14 were 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Samples of liver, back fat and perirenal fat were collected from each animal and kept at minus 20°C until analysis. Results for Groups 2 through 7 receiving the recommended dose are summarized in Table 8 and Groups 9 through 14 receiving twice the recommended dose are summarized in Table 9. The study (Cyanamid Websters 45970) only reported the limit of detection (0.5 m g/kg). Mean values and the 99% upper confidence limits of the mean concentration were reported for fat and liver tissues. Results were not recovery corrected.
In this study, there were no data provided to make a correlation of a single pour-on treatment with multiple pour-on treatments at any withdrawal time.

APPRAISAL
Moxidectin was evaluated previously at the 45th and 47th meeting of the Committee. At the 45th meeting, MRL's were recommended for cattle, sheep and deer in muscle, liver, kidney and fat. The MRL's in deer were temporary.
The sponsors provided new data for consideration at the 47th meeting of the Committee on a large sheep study indicating that the residues in sheep muscle could exceed the recommended MRL, if the preferred dosing schedule for psoroptic mange was used. The observation that there were higher residues in ovine muscle compared to bovine muscle was likely due to the higher fat content in sheep muscle and the lipophilic nature of moxidectin. Based on this large sheep study the 47th Committee recommended an MRL of 50 m g/kg in sheep muscle. The Tenth Session of the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods requested the 48th meeting of the Committee to consider, if the MRL for cattle muscle could be harmonized with the higher MRL in sheep muscle, and also consider new residue studies for cattle using the approved multiple dose treatments of moxidectin by either subcutaneous or pour-on administration.
Two studies using multiple dose treatment were submitted by the sponsor. In the subcutaneous injection study, 45 Angus steers were divided into one control and six treatment groups. All treatment groups contained seven animals. Four of the treatment groups received subcutaneous injections of moxidectin of 0.2 mg/kg body weight at day 0, 28, 56 and 84. Withdrawal periods for these four groups were 14, 21, 28 and 35 days following the last treatment, respectively. The two other groups received a single subcutaneous injection on day 84 also using the 0.2 mg/kg body weight dose. Withdrawal periods for these two groups were 14 and 35 days, respectively. Loin muscle and back fat samples were collected for residue analysis. The three standard deviation upper confidence limit for mean residues in fat for the four multiple treatments declined from 574 m g/kg at 14 days to 97 m g/kg at day 35. Only one muscle sample in the 14 day post treatment group had residues above the 10 m g/kg
limit of quantification at 13 m g/kg.
In the second study 58 Hereford cattle animals were treated with a 0.5% solution of moxidectin as a pour-on formulation. Two control groups were used. Six treatment groups with five animals each received the 0.5% solution at 1 ml/10 kg body weight (equivalent to 0.5 mg moxidectin/kg bw) on days 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84 days, having withholding periods of 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. The remaining treatment groups received the 0.5% solution at twice the recommended dose (1.0 mg/kg bw) with the same treatment and withholding periods. Samples of back fat, perirenal fat and liver were collected for residue analysis. The three standard deviation upper confidence limit for mean residues in the recommended dose treatment groups reached a maximum concentration for fat of 273 m g/kg on day 7 and declined to 122 m g/kg on day 35. Residues followed a similar pattern in liver tissue, reaching a maximum concentration of 35 m g/kg on day 7 and declining to 5 m g/kg on day 35.
Following multiple treatments at scheduled intervals, residues were higher in the subcutaneous than in the pour-on treatment groups. Residues were highest in fat with residues in liver and muscle tissues being successively lower. Using the recommended MRL for cattle fat of 500 m g/kg, and data from the subcutaneous treatment study, residues would deplete to the MRL in approximately 17 days based on the 99% upper confidence limit of the mean residue data. No direct determination of residues in liver or kidney tissue could be made for this subcutaneous treatment study. However, based on studies using a single subcutaneous treatment (see 45th report of the Committee), mean residue concentrations in liver and kidney would not be expected to exceed the respective MRL's of 100 m g/kg and 50 m g/kg when the residues in fat are at or below the MRL of 500 m g/kg. Raising the MRL for cattle muscle to 50 m g/kg was not considered warranted based on the residue data available for
multiple subcutaneous administration of moxidectin in cattle which indicated only one animal had residues (13 m g/kg) above the limit of quantification of the analytical method which was 10 m g/kg. Therefore, the Committee retained the MRL for cattle muscle at 20 m g/kg.

ADDENDUM

Background
The Forty-seventh Session of the Committee recommended the following MRLs for spiramycin in cattle, chickens and pigs.
Muscle
(cattle, pigs, chicken)
200 m g/kg
Liver
(cattle, pigs, chicken)
600 m g/kg
Kidney
(cattle, pigs)
300 m g/kg
(chickens)
800 m g/kg
Fat
(cattle, pigs, chicken)
300 m g/kg
Milk
(cattle)
100 m g/l
For cattle and chickens MRLs are expressed as the sum of spiramycin and neospiramycin, for pigs as spiramycin equivalents (antimicrobially active residues).
The 10th Session of the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods advanced the recommended MRLs for muscle, liver, kidney and fat (cattle and chickens) and muscle (pigs) to Step 8. The Codex Committee advanced the proposed draft MRLs for pigs (liver, kidney, fat) to Step 5/8, by omitting Steps 6 and 7, as these were modifications of previous assessments which presented no additional toxicological concerns. The Codex Committee also advanced the MRL of 100 m g/l for cattle milk to step 8. It noted proposals to increase this MRL to 200 m g/l and requested that the Expert Committee re-evaluates the MRL for cattle milk at its 48th meeting to determine, if it could be raised to 200 m g/l. The Codex Committee requested the Expert Committee to advise the Codex Alimentarius Commission of its opinion on raising the MRL from 100 m g/l to 200 m g/l, and indicated that it would support such an increase on the basis of that opinion.
Using the MRLs for chickens (which results in the largest theoretical maximum daily intake) and a standard daily intake of 300 g muscle, 100 g liver, 50 g kidney, 50 g fat and 1.5 litres of milk, the theoretical maximum daily intake of antimicrobially active spiramycin residues is 440 m g. Using an ADI of 0-50 m g/kg of body weight, a 60-kg person would therefore be permitted to consume 3000 m g/kg of antimicrobially active spiramycin residues. Therefore, the maximum daily intake of spiramycin residues of concern would use 14.7% of the ADI. If the MRL for cattle milk were increased to 200 m g/l, the theoretical maximum daily intake would increase to 590 m g or 19.7% of the ADI.

This document is one of three publications prepared by the forty-eighth session of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Geneva, Switzerland in February 1997, and dedicated exclusively to the evaluation of veterinary drug residues in food. The report of the meeting will be published in the WHO Technical Report Series, and the toxicological monographs as No. 39 in the WHO Food Additives Series. Residue monographs in this document provide information on chemical identity, properties, use, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, tissue residue depletion and analytical methods for substances indicated on the cover. This publication is meant for regulatory authorities, veterinary drug researchers and any other concerned persons who wish to gain information and insights on the needs and problems involved in establishing maximum limits for veterinary drug residues in food.

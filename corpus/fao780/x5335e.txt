<title>Non-wood forest products of Bhutan</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
For centuries, the people of Bhutan have lived in harmony with nature in the far reaches of the eastern Himalayas. The Kingdom of Bhutan remains one of the most forested countries in the world, and harbours an astounding diversity of plants and animals. The country's environment has benefitted significantly from deep-rooted Buddhist ethics and a long history of conservation leadership.
The deep reverence the Bhutanese people have for their natural environment exists in spite of, or more likely because of, their extreme dependence on it. The forests of Bhutan, in particular, provide critical materials for the daily subsistence of most Bhutanese families. The Bhutanese make considerable use of wood for houses, shingles, tools, fences, and numerous other items, as well as for cooking and heating. But it is the extensive use of non-wood forest products by the Bhutanese that is especially striking.
Non-wood forest products touch nearly every aspect of the lives of a Bhutanese. The country's forests provide food, fodder, medicine, oils, resins, fibers, dyes, and raw materials for baskets, traditional paper, houses, brooms, mats and numerous other items.
Until recently, most non-wood forest products were used locally by Bhutanese people. Increasingly, however, these products are attracting the interest of outside buyers and consumers in far-away countries. This interest presents both opportunities and risks for Bhutan - opportunities include cash income for the rural poor, revenues for the government for developing the country, and increased investment in rural infrastructure and processing centers; risks include potential over-exploitation of natural resources, inequitable distribution of benefits, and shortages of raw materials that might other wise be used for traditional and local needs.
This publication, prepared by the Forestry Services Division of the Bhutan Ministry of Agriculture, highlights the extensive use and potential of non-wood forest products in Bhutan. It should serve as a useful introduction for all foresters, biologists, and rural development workers interested in Bhutan's complex and bountiful non-wood forest resources and products.

Preface
Often there is a tendency to associate forests with trees and timber production only. Other products, such as bamboo, cane, oil, fibre, floss food, fodder and medicinal plants, are sidelined as merely "Minor Forest Produce," or MFP. Some so-called MFP, however, is economically even more valuable than timber. Moreover, its social and cultural values also add to its importance.
Forestry development, through people's participation programs, is both an important objective and strategy of the Royal Government of Bhutan's Seventh Five-Year Plan. These programs are expected to improve rural people's understanding of the importance of forests and, at the same time, contribute to improving their daily life. Classical forestry models that look at trees alone may not provide the necessary incentives to trigger wide response from the people. Social forestry models must provide quick and attractive economic returns. MFP, particularly medicinal plants, has a tremendous potential as cash crops, and it can often be grown alongside numerous tree species.
In Bhuta's past development activities, unfortunately, MFP as the name suggests, has been accorded less attention than it deserves. Such knowledge as does exist is limited. This ignorance of MFP's value and potential prevents us from reaping the full economic benefits from our vast storehouse of genetic resources. We are not yet sure how to harvest produce from the forests on a sustainable basis. The technology for cultivating such resources has yet to be adequately explored. It is hoped that the change in nomenclature, from MFP to non-wood forest products, will not only give MFP a better image, but also lead to the development of these important resources. The first step in doing this was to review existing information and compile a comprehensive document as a reference base of all local knowledge. A committee was set up for just this purpose. The committee then submitted this report. I am happy to say that their work has surpassed expectations and I am extremely pleased
witch the results.
I congratulate the committee on producing its excellent document within such a short period. This report has greatly improved our knowledge and should act as a catalyst for further development.

The Royal Government of Bhutan
The sudden rise of the Himalayas from the flat Indo-Gangetic plains into jagged and lofty mountain peaks endows Bhutan with a wide range of ecological zones. In the Himalayas, it is possible to move from tropical conditions to the alpine zone in a matter of hours. The flora and fauna are thus at once both diverse and unique to Bhutan's singular geography.
Most of the Himalayas, unfortunately, are in an advanced stage of decay Some authors even describe the Himalayas as dying mountains. For the rural communities of these soaring mountains, the world's highest, over-population and over-use of land resources long ago crossed the line of sustainability. At the same time, biodiversity has inevitably become much poorer, the protective value of the forests has been lost and the region, particularly downstream areas, faces severe, natural calamities every year.
Fortunately, Bhutan, in the Eastern Himalayas, enjoys a somewhat more hopeful situation. Here people have learnt to live in harmony with nature in a symbiotic relationship that goes back untold centuries. The Buddhist philosophy of love and respect for nature has also greatly influenced the people's attitude towards their land and its environment. Thus 60 percent of Bhutan's forest cover is still in a pristine state. Flora and fauna, extinct or threatened elsewhere, continue to thrive in Bhutan.
Forest policy
Bhutan's forest policy places conservation above all other considerations. Harvesting or commercial use of the forest is only permitted after conservation goals have been met and only if management policies ensure sustainable use.
Forest strategy
Bhutan has designated 23 percent of its national territory as protected areas, distributed over different ecozones. These are strictly controlled for the conservation of flora, fauna and biodiversity.
All remaining forests are designated production forests. Their management is also guided by conservation principles. Bhutan places strong emphasis on people's participation in forest management and on the development of forestry extension services.
Forest legislation rules and regulations
Rules and regulations are regularly updated to improve and better enforce forest conservation policies (the Royal Government of Bhutan's Master Plan for Forestry Development 1991, Annex Report No. X). These rules, however, still allow the Bhutanese people to practice their traditional use of forest products. Here are a few examples:
Medicinal Plants
 The 1974 National Forest Policy categorises medicinal plants and herbs as resources yet to be fully exploited. Hence the Policy specifies that these resources be surveyed for efficient management and use.
 May 25, 1988 - The Director of Forests approved a proposal to: 1) ban exports of medicinal plants, and 2) establish joint efforts by the Department of Forests (DOF) and the National Institute of Traditional Medicine (NITM) to both collect and cultivate medicinal plants.
Resin
 April 3, 1985 - Revised rules on resin tapping from chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) were approved.
Natural Dyes
 January 4, 1980 - The Royal Government of Bhutan waived royalties and sales taxes on the collection and sale of lac and waste products therefrom. This was to revive the dying art of lac cultivation and associated activities. No monopoly is now permitted.
 September 8, 1985 - Exports of vegetable dyes were curtailed. These are now for domestic use only.
The abrupt rise of the Himalayas from the plains of India determines everything in Bhutan - topography, settlement, economy and climate.
Bamboo and Cane (Rattan)
 November 7, 1978 - The Government decided that villagers in the Phontsholing area could henceforth collect bamboo and cane without paying taxes or royalties. This is to encourage the production of handicrafts for sale and domestic use.
 May 7, 1979 - The Government gave Mongar and Zhemgang villagers permission to transport "bangchungs," "palangs" (both traditional bamboo containers) and other products made of bamboo or cane anywhere, as long as they are for gifts, and not for sale.
 September 2, 1984 The Government, to encourage handicrafts production, allowed Dhrumjar (Mempa) Trongsa villagers to collect bamboo and cane for sale or domestic use without paying taxes or royalties.
Other Forest Products
No legislation, rules or regulations have yet been enacted for essential oils, mushrooms, and other forest products.
The importance of non-wood forest products
More than 80 percent of the Bhutanese population depends on agriculture and animal husbandry for its livelihood. To remain sustainable, the country's farm system is highly dependent on forests. Non-wood forest products, used daily, are taken for granted. Important as they are, the full impact of these products on Bhutan's rural economy is yet to be either assessed or documented.
Grazing and Fodder Production
Animal husbandry is an important contributor to the country's rural economy. Almost every household maintains at least a few cattle for draft power, animal products and for manure. Many Bhutanese keep large herds as a status symbol or as insurance against hard times. The country's animal population is estimated at 300,000 cattle and buffaloes, 28,000 yaks, 40,000 sheep, 42,000 goats and 22,000 horses.
These animals' dependence on forests for fodder is not as yet fully appreciated. It is general Bhutanese practice to simply chase the animals into the forests to forage wherever they like and for whatever is available. In Bhutan, forests and grazing lands often overlap. During winter, when forest fodder becomes scarce in the country's colder areas, cattle are driven to forests in warmer climes. Tree fodder is collected, particularly for the milch cows so important for milk production during winter.
Bamboo
Bamboo is rightfully known as the "poor man's timber." Its use is so versatile that it merits a full study on its own. In Bhutan, bamboo has many uses. Due to the country's varied climate, many different kinds are available. Large bamboo, such as Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, is found in tropical areas, while the very small Arundinaria maling is found at high altitudes.
One of the most common uses for bamboo in Bhutan is for making bows and arrows. Archery is the national sport and an important cultural activity. Bows are made from Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, though only those that grow on particular microsites produce good bows. Arrows are made from high altitude bamboo. Making these arrows requires considerable skill. The arrows' feathers, for example, are obtained only from one type of wild pheasant, while the glue for attaching them is made only from fish skin.
Split bamboo is commonly woven into mats for house walls and roofs.
Producing fine bamboo baskets and other containers is a speciality of the people in the country's eastern districts. Such products, now becoming popular with tourists, are marketed throughout Bhutan. Poor people also use bamboo baskets for storage and as water containers. Many of the country's poor live in houses made entirely of bamboo. In southern and eastern Bhutan, the larger bamboos are all but indispensable to rural life, so much so that living without them cannot even be imagined. The smaller bamboos found in central and western Bhutan are used for weaving mats, as fencing, or as roofing for temporary shelters.
Traditional Medicine
Traditional medicine is still practiced throughout Bhutan, with its more than 300 species of medicinal plants. The National Institute of Traditional Medicine (NITM), for example, is a well-organised institute staffed with traditional and western trained doctors. The Institute regularly collects plants to produce medicine as per formulae cited in ancient medical scriptures. NITM combines traditional medicine with acupuncture to treat all types of diseases. The Institute is rapidly gaining in popularity, even though a nearby modern hospital provides free services.
While NITM's set-up is quite elaborate, simpler systems of traditional medicine - provided by individuals or groups - are practiced in rural areas. In the south, traditions are different. Knowledge of medicinal plants is passed down from father to son. Some practitioners combine spiritualism, and its accompanying elaborate rituals, with dispensing medicine.
As traditional medicine does not have the side effects associated with modern-day medicine, it is once again becoming popular. The country's modernisation almost wiped out this age-old practice and once-thriving business. It is known that in olden days at least two plants, ruta (Saussurea lappa) and menu (Innula helenium), were cultivated and marketed in the Bumthang Valley. Today many people do not even remember what these plants look like. A remnant of menu, however, has been found and is being cultivated by at least one family.
The 14 most prevalent diseases in Bhutan (Master Plan for Forestry Development 1991) in order of seriousness are:
 Respiratory tract infections
 Diarrhoea/dysentery
 Skin infections
 Worm infections
 Malaria
 Conjunctivitis
 Peptic ulcer syndrome
 Otitis media
 Tooth and gum diseases
 Urinary tract infections and nephritis
 Childhood diseases
 Sexually-transmitted diseases
 Diseases of the female genital tract
 Complications in pregnancy and childbirth puerperium
Natural Dyes
Natural dyes comprise another group of non-wood forest products associated with Bhutanese traditional arts and culture. Cloth weaving is an important economic activity in the central and eastern "dzongkhags," or regions. At one time, the colouring of textiles was entirely done by using natural dyes. Many plants were cultivated for this, and some were even exported to Tibet. Natural dyes are gradually being replaced by chemicals or ready-made coloured thread. Improvements in the quality of natural dyes, however, may revive their production. A project at Khaling in eastern Bhutan is presently compiling an information base on natural dyes and conducting research to improve such dyes.
Pine Resin and Lemon Grass
Pine resin collection and lemon grass distillation are recently introduced activities in Bhutan. More than 270 tons of resin are collected each year by villagers in the country's eastern districts and sold to a factory. As the work is carried out close to their farms, farmers supplement their incomes by doing such collection when they are free from farm work. These activities pump more than Nu. 30 million (just under US$ 1 million) into the country's rural economy.
Lemon grass distillation employs some 400 families in the eastern dzongkhags. To these families, this activity has become even more important than farming.
Forest Foods
Forests also play an important role in Bhutan's food security. Food from the forests becomes critical to rural areas in times of crisis, when transporting food to remote areas is difficult, or when people have no money to buy food. Because of Bhutan's varied and unpredictable climatic conditions, from time to time the country faces localised droughts and other conditions causing crop failures.
During hard times, people search for food in the forests to supplement their meagre supplies. Thus an important plant is yam (Dioscorea sp.). This plant has long tubers and requires a considerable amount of digging to obtain. Tuber hunting, though, is always a gamble. A vine may yield up to 10 kilogrammes of tubers, or nothing at all. Yet the plant's exotic taste and the hungry mouths waiting back home, make the hard digging worthwhile. When food shortages become extreme, the bulbs that grow on the vines are also eaten. This occurs only under the most desperate situations as the bulbs, which are stewed, are bitter and cannot be eaten too often. Bhutan has other less well-known tubers, but Dioscorea remains the most important substitute for food grains.
Another commodity that sends poorer farmers into the forests during difficult times is seeds, from which cooking oil is extracted. Many wild seeds can be used to produce oil. The seeds of the Symplocos tree, for example, are commonly used for this purpose, even in good years. The seed of Gynocardia sp., a subtropical tree, is used less frequently because of its highly-poisonous covering. Sal (Shorea robusta) seeds are collected and marketed in India because Bhutan still lacks the requisite extraction technology at the rural level. Neolitsea is cultivated throughout Bhutan, particularly in the country's eastern districts. Aesandra butyracea, a multipurpose tree, is also an important source of oil.
A variety of forest fruits and nuts are regularly consumed in Bhutan, but contribute little to food security. Some fruit is plucked and eaten by rural folks passing through forests; some may be taken home. Fruits and nuts, such as the walnut, Cornus, Zizyphus, and Morus, are occasionally marketed. Some wild fruits are rich in vitamins. Phyllanthus emblica, for example, is recognised as a rich source of vitamin C.
Villagers also use many plants as vegetables. Fern shoots, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, cane shoots and even orchid flowers are marketed in their respective seasons. These are much sought after delicacies throughout Bhutan. Mushrooms, particularly Cantharellus cibarius, are canned and sold for as much as Nu. 50 (about US$ 1.50) per kilogramme. These are found in oak-pine forests in the country's temperate zones. Some are exported. The oak mushroom is-widely cultivated on oak billets.
Traditional paper made from Daphne spp. and Edgeworthia gardneri has become a popular export product.
Villagers in western Bhutan commonly collect and sell beetle leaf and beetle nut on a year-round basis. Leaves are collected from tropical and sub-tropical forests, then transported from western Bhutan to northern districts where wild leaves are preferred over cultivated varieties.
Bhutan's forests also produce a number of spices, used locally and exported. Piper sp. is one of the country's most important spices. Though not used locally, this spice earns people in tropical areas a good income during season. Cinnamomum sp. bark and leaves are also collected and exported. Zanthoxylum sp. seeds are marketed locally and are extensively used throughout the country.
Problems and constraints in developing non-wood forest products
Bhutan's potential for developing its non-wood forest products (NWFP) is quite considerable. But this promising sector is burdened, at least for the present, by several serious constraints. Too little is known, for instance, about the country's existing resources, management strategies, best harvesting practices and marketing opportunities. Professionals in the NWFP sector are far too few and they have limited knowledge of practical management and prospects for further and future development. Institutional support is extremely weak.
There is an acute lack of inventory data and even many of the best informed Bhutanese professionals admit they are all but completely in the dark as to the country's real NWFP resources. But finding out just what these resources are and, equally important, where they are requires money, and money is precisely the resource in shortest supply in the country. Bhutan is, after all, one of the poorest countries on earth. Per capita income is a lowly US$ 150 a year and government financial resources are never adequate to cover Bhutan's almost endless development needs.
The shortage of quality training institutes in the country is another major constraint to Bhutanese development. Legal codes and laws governing most phases of forestry development are as yet inadequate and where they do exist they are all too often ignored. Comprehensive enforcement of modern forestry legislation, even were it to exist, would require more forestry officers than Bhutan could afford to put into the field.
Geography itself is a massive physical barrier to the country's rapid development. Bhutan lies in the heart of the beautiful but stupendously rugged Eastern Himalayas, and is, in fact, one of the most mountainous countries on the planet. To build a good all-weather road in Bhutan is a colossal and extremely expensive achievement. The present road network, for instance, though by far the best the country has ever known, makes the transport of goods a slow, costly, and at times dangerous, endeavour. Roads, uniformly narrow due to the Himalayan peaks through which they pass, are few and far between.
During the long rainy season and the winters of ice and snow, Bhutan's roads often become altogether impassable, beset as they are by landslides and washouts. All this adds up to far more than just human inconvenience. It is a major obstacle to development of any kind.
These problems and developmental constraints seriously affect every aspect of the country's social and economic advancement, including its budding non-wood forest products industry.
General recommendations for long-term activities in developing non-wood forest products
 Establish national priorities based on all known non-wood forest products and prioritise them according to an agreed set of criteria.
 Aim for a more complete inventory of the prioritised commodities, giving species, locations, and quantities. This would involve taxonomists, botanists, forest rangers, and foresters, among others.
 Train personnel in plant identification, proper collection methods, appropriate processing techniques, efficient manufacturing procedures, quality control, and the generation of new designs.
 Establish and maintain gene banks for conservation, tissue culture, and seed storage, and start a collection of voucher herbarium specimens; set up extension and information centres for teaching the art of vegetable dyeing.
 Set up post-harvest handling facilities as close to commodity sources as possible for drying, sifting, deep freezing, controlled atmosphere, etc.
 Initiate annual scholarships and grants for B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in related disciplines or short-term, non-degree training programmes for acquiring new technologies.
 Create an agency, or agencies, to serve as the national clearing house for all matters pertaining to non-wood forest products, including marketing. This should include a mechanism to oversee annual reviews of accomplishments, preferably conducted by unbiased third-party personnel.

Bamboo
Bamboo grows naturally in Bhutan because of the country's largely undisturbed forests and the limited agriculture practiced in areas where bamboo proliferates (Table 1). The Kingdom probably has the greatest variety of bamboo species of all the Himalayan countries. Bhutan's great range of altitudes and climates account for this diversity. Bhutanese bamboo is principally of Himalayan and Chinese-Japanese origins, with some Southeast Asian and South Indian contributions. Bhutan has 15 genera and 31 species of bamboo. Possibly as many as 50 more species exist, but have yet to be identified.

Distribution
Knowledge of the distribution of Bhutan's bamboo species is limited. Major species found in sub-tropical areas include Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, D. sikkimensis, D. patelleries, D. strictus Drepanostachyum hookerianum, and D. intermedium Higher elevation species include Arundinaria racemosa, A. maling and A. polystachya. Other species are Dendrocalamus hookeri and Arundinaria griffithii (Griernd dwarf rhododendron trees).
Current and Potential Uses
Bamboo has long been used by the Bhutanese people. A few of its major uses, identified with the genera most commonly used for each product, are listed below:
Bambusa species
 split and woven mats
 used whole for construction and scaffolding
Dendrocalamus species
 roofs and walls of houses
 domestic and agricultural implements, such as water containers, baskets, trays, mats, etc.
 leaves provide valuable fodder for livestock
 shoots are edible and can be preserved
Drepanostachyum species
 finely woven domestic and agricultural equipment, such as baskets, trays, mats, sieves, etc.
 livestock shelters and temporary dwellings
 parts of traditional houses
 edible shoots
Thamnocalamus species
 roofing, mats and fencing
Arundinaria species
 high-quality woven handicraft products, such as food and drink containers, hats, arrows, quivers, etc.
 winter and dry season livestock fodder
 durable mats for building construction fencing material
 edible shoots
 shelter and food for endemic fauna in reserve areas
Bhutan's overall development policy is to make limited use of many natural resources, concentrating on the renewable ones. This policy recognises the importance of rural activities, such as agriculture, forestry, and handicrafts production, in the country's long-term development strategy. Bamboo is involved in all of these. The demand for bamboo is, therefore, bound to increase over time, particularly for use as fodder and other multipurpose uses. There is ample scope for greater bamboo production, especially in the country's higher areas where communities are widely dispersed and agriculture is less profitable.
The manufacture of handicrafts using locally-available materials, such as bamboo, and employing simple techniques and equipment is now emphasised in Bhutan. The country is fortunate in having highly-skilled craftsmen, a strong cultural heritage, and a good supply of renewable resources. There is a need, however, for improving the design of handicrafts and hence their market appeal. This could raise the income of the rural people while allowing them to maintain their culture and way of life.
Increasing the use of bamboo resources in the making of Bhutanese handicrafts has the advantage of building upon existing traditions without threatening the country's cultural heritage or way of life. The people of Zhemgang, for example, are permitted to collect bamboo free of taxes for making "bangchungs" and "palangs" (traditional containers) etc., for their own use or as gifts. Only unwise human interference has retarded bamboo proliferation in Bhutan.
Using simple methods, bamboo harvested from forests is often transported long distances.
Cane
Cane is the stem of the climbing palm of the genus Calamus and other related genera. Bhutanese cane belongs to the Palmae family and is commonly found in the country's tropical and subtropical areas. Palmae is represented by 170 genera and more than 2,500 species worldwide. There are 13 genera of Palmae found in Bhutan.
Distribution
As with bamboo, knowledge of the distribution of Bhutan's cane is limited. Species so far reported in tropical areas are Calamus acanthospathatus and Calamus tenuis, found in Zhemgang, Trongsa, Punakha, Chukha, Haa, Mongar, Trashigang, Samdrup Jongkha, Pemagatshel, Samtse and Sarpang Districts.
Calamus acanthospathatus is locally known as "de" (Sharchop-kha) and "phogrebeth" (Nepal). Calamus tenuis is known as "menj" (Sharchop-kha). A third cane species, locally-known as "phasi", has been reported but its presence is not yet confirmed.
Current Uses and Potential
Calamus acanthospathatus is a common climber, which grows extensively in Bhutan. It yields strong cane and is used as a substitute for rope and as cable for suspension bridges. It is also used for wickerwork, baskets, and containers. Thicker cane is used for making furniture frames, walking sticks and umbrella handles. The shoots of this plant are edible.
Calamus tenuis is used for making household items, such as mats, screens, furniture and chair seats.
The long distances from where cane grows to roads and the limited availability of this resource, restrict the potential for expansion of its use and exploitation.
Wild banana
Distribution
Wild banana (Musa spp.) grows in Bhutan's sub-tropical and temperate regions at up to 1,800 metres (Table 2). There are three varieties. Although it has never been successfully managed, wild banana grows prolifically on "tseri" (shifting cultivation) land abandoned after cultivation, openings in forests, and on most terraces. Regeneration is quick and growth is profuse in these particular areas.
Current Uses and Potential
Banana leaves are used in house construction, roofing, and for making temporary sheds. The leaves and stems are also used as fodder for elephants and other animals. The flowers and fruits are, of course, edible. The fibres from banana leaves make good paper, but they are not commonly used for this purpose in Bhutan.
The inner soft core of the banana stem is edible. The Bhutanese use the water extracted from this stem to cure stomach ailments and as an antidote to Aconitum poisoning. This type of poisoning, from the Aconitum spp., is rare, but can happen during the preparation of medicine. The leaves and stems are also used for preserving fish, meat, butter, "pani" (beetle leaves), and other foodstuffs. Banana stems are also used as conduits and to make rafts.
The country's growing production and demand for paper will undoubtedly increase the demand for this renewable banana resource, thus increasing rural Bhutanese income. The traditional uses of banana leaves and stems - part of the country's cultural heritage - will, however, continue.

Fibre, floss and brooms
Fibre
Bhutan's main sources of fibre are from various stems and leaves, though fibre may also be extracted from roots, fruits and seeds. Bhutanese fibre species include odal (Sterculia villosa) for making rope, Girardiana spp. for producing ropes and gunny bags, Musa spp. for paper making, and Areca catechu. Table 3 gives information on fibre in Bhutan. Other fibre-producing species are Cannabis sp. (bark), Urtica sp. ("jazu" in Sharchop-kha), Girardiana palmata ("zangjazu" in Sharchop-kha), Boehmeria sp. ("pu yangzewa" in Sharchop-kha), Agave sp., Daphne sp., Edgeworthia sp., Kydia calycina and Grewia sp.
Floss
Floss is obtained from tree pods, and collected from kapas (Gossypium spp.) and semul (Bombax ceiba). The capsules of these trees yield floss which is soft, yet strong. Gossypium and Bombax ceiba grow in the sub-tropical areas of southern Bhutan (Table 4). Rural Bhutanese collect floss to make pillows and mattresses. Another floss species reported is Ceiba pentandra.

Other materials used for brooms are lemon grass, pal ("cari" or "sysam" in Sharchop-kha), Phoebe, Sida, bamboo leaves and split bamboo culms, and coconut leaves.

The Royal Government of Bhutan
A wide range of plant diversity covers Bhutan's two main mountain ranges, the Lho-Menjong and the Druk-Yul. From these rugged mountains come over 300 plant species traditionally used in preparing indigenous (Ayurvedic) medicine. Table 6 shows some of these plant species.
Medicinal plants collected from Bhutan's temperate and lower zones are known under the traditional broad classification as "THRO-MEN," while plants from the country's alpine zone are known as "NGO-MEN."
In the case of "THRO-MEN" plants, specific parts of the plants (e.g., the roots, bark, wood, leaves, flowers or fruit) are generally collected, while for "NGO-MEN," the whole plant is gathered for its medicinal properties.
Trade in medicinal plants in the past
In Bhutan's past, medicinal plants, such as manjito (Rubia cordifolia), chereta (Swertia cherita), pipla (Piper nigrum and Piper longum), sarpagandah or nakbhel (Rauvolfia serpentina) and putishing/kutki (Picorrhiza kurroa), among others, were sold to India. The sales method used was the leasing of large tracts of land through tenders or auctions. The highest bidder was given full access to and jurisdiction over seasonal collection in the area allotted. Such produce was classified as minor forest produce (MFP) and could be exported to India upon issuance of a "Certificate of Origin" by the Divisional Forest Officers concerned.
The Royal Government of Bhutan realised that in the long run, however, such nonscientific harvesting of plant species would bring more harm than the revenue generated. Hence the ban on exporting MFP - which included medicinal plants - imposed in the early 1980s, remains valid to date.
Scope for international marketing
A number of medicinal plant species growing naturally in Bhutan have international market value. Among these are agar wood (Aquilaria agallocha), Rauvolfia serpentina, tshe (Ephedra gerardina), Himalayan yew (Taxus baccata), chutsa (Rheum nobile), chumtsa (Rheum accuminita), kutki/putishing (Picorrhiza kurroa), pangpoi (Nardostachys jatamansi), tsenduk rig (Aconitum spp.), and yartsa-gunbu (Cordyceps sinensis). All are in high demand for pharmaceuticals.
Owing to the great volume of competitive synthetic products currently marketed, the trade in medicinal plants and their derivatives has declined in many industrialised countries (Study on the Market for Selected Medicinal Plants and Their Derivatives, Geneva, 1982.) Trade in botanicals, however, has risen following their relatively recent increased use by the food and cosmetics industries. A renewed interest in traditional medicine in Asia, and the introduction of health foods in Europe and North America, has between them provided new outlets for many botanical products.
Over 400 botanicals are used commercially in Western Europe, with Hamburg as the centre for the trade. Of the Western nations, the United States is the major importer of medicinal plants. Japan is the major importer among Asian countries.
Scope for cultivating medicinal plants
The National Institute of Traditional Medicine (NITM) has a programme for research on, and propagation of, medicinal plants. During the reign of Bhutan's second king, His Majesty Jijme Wangchuck (1926-52), the people of the Bumthang Valley cultivated two medicinal plant species - manu (Innula helenium) and ruta (Saussurea lappa). Both these plants were used for producing "sowa-rigpa" medicine and incense. Unfortunately, the present generation in Bumthang knows little of these two plants.
The menu plant, however, is in demand from NITM in Thimphu. The plant has survived years of neglect and is now cultivated in Ura by one family for supply to the Indigenous Hospital in Thimphu. The fate of the second plant, ruta, is not known. A survey is needed to determine if it still exists in the valley.
During Bhutan's Fourth Five-Year Plan (1972-77), the planting of agar wood in lower Kheng villages, such as Panbang, Shilingtot, Mamung, and Pantang, was encouraged by the late Dasho Keiji Nishioka on his family's private land. The agar wood plants have now grown to over 10 metres in height and 12 to 15 centimetres in diameter (measured during the author's visit in January, 1993). Some villagers are growing 20 to 3(:) or more trees, and say the trees are not difficult to propagate. Only those plants infected by a particular fungus, through a yet unknown mechanism, however, produce the highly-valued agar wood. No report has been received so far as to whether some of the planted trees have produced this most valuable type of agar wood.
Ipacac (Cephalus ipacacaunha) and Dioscorea deltoides are cultivated on large plantations in India just across the Bhutanese border. Proceeds from these plantations reportedly amount to over 10 million rupees, or some US$ 319,000, per annum. Similar plantations are quite possible within Bhutan.
Nature: The best teacher
Most plants readily propagate naturally. For example, pipla (Piper spp.) is very common in Bhutan's southern belt and Rheum accuminita and Aconitum sp. frequently occur in the sub-alpine and alpine belts of the country's northern region. The abundance of these plants is entirely due to a well-balanced ecosystem within which these plants flourish.
Nature is the best teacher. In the absence of technical know-how for the propagation of many important medicinal plants, studies must be undertaken and data gathered on the how these. plants can be cultivated and made economically beneficial. The environmental conditions - geology, soil, plant association, climate, etc. - must also be studied and used as a guide and reference for their large-scale propagation.
Medicinal plants, present collection trends and current problems
Upon request by NITM to collect medicinal plants, the Forestry Services Division (FSD) issues permits on a case-by-case basis. The location for collection and quantity to be collected are specified in the permits. But often the collection of the permitted quantity is not possible as the required species is not available in adequate volume.
NITM shows samples of the medicinal plants to local labourers, who are then requested to collect and bring in the required quantity of each species. The collectors are paid on a daily basis, or sometimes contracted under lump-sum agreements. The required permits are given to the collectors, who are paid only upon receipt of the produce. Payment is generally made for each kilogramme collected. For quality control, "dungtshoes," or indigenous technicians, supervise the collection whenever possible. It is virtually impossible, however, for Bhutan's scant core of technicians to reach every collection area for screening. In most cases, meeting the collection target for the year is more important to collectors than is scientific harvesting on a sustainable basis. Lacking technical directives and proper guidelines, this is to be expected. This is the probable reason why some species have decreased by almost 50 percent over the past 20-25 years in localities where they once grew
abundantly (personal communication with locals and NITM, 1994).
But this should not lead one to conclude that all harvesting is necessarily destructive. Quite the contrary, many plant species benefit when mature plants are removed and space is created for new plants to grow.
Generally, alpine plants flower in August, which coincides with the NITM team's collection schedule for herbal plants. At this time, even the fruits from the earlier-flowering plants are not yet ripe or mature enough for their seeds to be shed. For many herbs, the whole plants are collected, including both flowers and fruit. This method of collection reduces the chances for regeneration and hence threatens the very existence of some species. If such methods continue, some species may become extinct.
General recommendations
 Collect detailed information on the extent and frequency of occurrence of species. Priorities should be set for each species.
 Develop efficient and cost-effective methods for propagating rare and important medicinal plants, as well as for such species as agar wood, important on the international market.
 Legalise and promote cultivation of commercial medicinal plants on private farms under a social forestry scheme. In the initial stages, the Government should establish an export market and "buy-back" system to encourage private entrepreneurs to undertake mass cultivation. Thus the Indigenous Hospital's requirements would be met, while the surplus could be exported. Establishing plantations for medicinal plants would also reduce wasteful harvesting from the natural forest.
 The Forest Research Division should co-operate with NITM's Research and Propagation Programme, including in the exchange of information and technical know-how. At the same time, FSD should develop a mechanism to monitor NITM's methods, the quantities it collects, and the species harvested annually. At present, FSD is completely uninformed on these matters.
Conclusion
If present trends in ad-hoc harvesting/collection continue, the scope for the economical harvesting of all medicinal plants from the wild, on a sustainable basis, will become practically nil. The only option remaining is to introduce large-scale cultivation through artificial propagation. Natural resources are presently being depleted in the natural forests due to annual and non-scientific collection of the various species on an ad hoc basis. New settlements and the expansion of land under cultivation also threatens the survival of natural forests. Unless artificial propagation is adopted, it is only a matter of time before some of these plants become extinct.

Traditional paper
Background
Bhutan uses the bark of two tree species in the manufacture of traditional paper ("deh-sho"): dhenap (Daphne) and dhekap (Edgeworthia).
Resources
Bhutan has five species of Daphne and one of Edgeworthia (Table 7). All six are found throughout the country, but their distribution and frequency varies - a constraint in providing a continuous supply of raw materials to local cottage industries (Table 8). The ad hoc collection of this raw material would not only deplete existing stocks, but threaten its sustainable management as well. Detailed surveys have yet to be carried out.
Processing
The method used to produce paper from bark is quite simple and does not involve the use of chemicals. The plants are stripped and dried and then taken to production centres. In the traditional system, a few strips of the fibre are soaked in a pond and then beaten with a mallet on a flat stone. The fine pulp is placed on a bamboo screen and allowed to spread evenly by suspending it in water. The screen is then dried in the sun. Today the process has become more mechanised, using imported equipment and screens. Besides the greater quantity produced, the paper's quality has also improved. Table 9 gives the annual raw material requirements of Bhutan's paper-making units. The country has a number of family-operated paper-making units. The only semi-mechanised unit is the Jungshi Hand-made Paper Factory, in Thimphu.

* This figure was obtained from information gathered from raw material surveys. These surveys are conducted when an entrepreneur proposes to establish a paper-making unit in a particular area. The actual availability of Daphne in Bhutan is much more than shown here. Since the demand is growing, the Forestry Services Division is planning to carry out a more comprehensive survey of the resource throughout the country. Guidelines are being prepared for carrying out this assessment, and for the silvicultural management of Daphne.

Note: As the above table clearly indicates, the demand for Daphne for producing local paper is very high. Thus, more entrepreneurs are applying for licenses to establish local paper factories. The volume of raw materials required for an individual unit varies, depending on its size and the number of workers available. Some entrepreneurs prefer to operate a small unit for a few years to produce only a few hundred sheets of local paper for a specific purpose. Others intend to operate large enterprises on a continuing basis. The method of paper processing, therefore, varies from one paper unit to another. Only a few units are presently operating, while others are being established. Quantifying actual demand and production on an annual basis is, therefore, difficult.
Products from the Jungshi Hand-made Paper Factory in Thimphu are now exported to many countries.
Uses
Paper quality depends on the species used. Daphne gives strong, dark paper, while paper from Edgeworthia is whiter and more fragile. Since all paper produced is durable and attractive, it is used for gift wrapping, greetings cards, prayer books and important deeds.
Marketing
Hand-made paper sells well on both the domestic and foreign markets. Demand from Sweden and the United Kingdom amounts to about 30,000 sheets a year. Japan, Austria and the U.S. have also purchased a few thousand sheets as samples (personal communication with the manager of Jungshi Hand-made Paper Factory in Thimphu).
Production
Figures for Bhutan's total paper production are not presently available. The only reliable figure is for Jungshi Hand-made Paper Factory, which produces about 1,500 sheets per day.
Essential oils
Background
Essential oils, also known as 'volatile oils.' are odoriferous substances widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom. They occur in some 60 plant families and almost any part of a plant may yield oil.
Extraction
Depending on the quantity and stability of the compound, essential oils are mainly extracted by three methods:
 distillation by hot water or steam
 pressed by hand or using machinery
 extraction using such volatile solvents as hot oils, fats (maceration), or cold neutral fats (enfleurage)
Uses
Because of their odour and high volatility, essential oils have a variety of uses, for example, soaps and cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, confectionery, aerated water, scented tobacco and incense, among others.
Grass Oil
Lemon Grass Oil
Source: Lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) is found over large areas in Mongar and Trashigang Districts (Diagram 1). It is common in chir pine forests, especially on sandy or gravelly, sloping areas. Lemon grass contains citral - its major constituent. Lemon grass oil quality is judged by its citral content and its solubility in alcohol.
Properties and uses: The oil is of a reddish-yellow to reddish-brown colour, with a strong, lemon odour. It is used in the perfume, soap and cosmetics industries. Lemon grass forms the starting material in the manufacture of synthetic Vitamin A. It is also used in pharmaceutical preparations, such as pain balm, disinfectants, and mosquito-repellent creams.
Diagram 1 Lemon Grass Area in Bhutan
Production and trade: Bhutan's production and trade of lemon grass oil was introduced and initially carried out by the Aromatic and Phytochemicals Section of Tashi Commercial Corporation in 1983 and 1984. The oil was processed by steam distillation, using a low-cost, cottage-type distillery made from second-hand petrol drums. Tashi Commercial Corporation now has a large distilling unit at Kurizampa and has sold large numbers of smaller units to the farmers from whom the company now buys the oils. The company also buys lemon grass collected from the wild and delivered to road sides.
The FAO-supported "Production of Essential Oils by Small Holders in Remote Areas" project helped establish two essential oil distilleries at Pakhadrang (Monger District) and Lungtenzampa (Trashigang District) in 1990, with a total capacity of 2.5 tons of lemon grass per eight-hour working day. The project also helped in establishing germplasm and multiplication nurseries at Gyelpoizhing (Monger District) and Chhali (Monger District), using plant materials from India and Europe. Trials on mentha, citronella, vetiver, palmarosa grass and Basilicum are presently being conducted.
Scope: To obtain higher quality essential oil, wild lemon grass must be replaced by improved varieties. Palmarosa grass, the most promising alternative, should be planted in areas presently under lemon grass. Palmarosa oil sells for almost double the price of lemon grass oil on the international market.
A few field experiments have been carried out on the native lemon grass growing wild in Bhutan's eastern region. Experiments on different harvest dates, commencing the end of July and spaced at monthly intervals, were conducted to estimate the effects on the biomass and the subsequent oil yields.
The findings showed that the September harvest of native lemon grass yielded the highest biomass (3.22 tons per hectare) and oil yield (9.83 kilogrammes per hectare), with 0.31 percent oil recovery. These experiments, however, have to be repeated to confirm these findings.
Lemon grass, which grows extensively in Mongar and Trashigang districts, provides the raw material for a growing essential oils industry in eastern Bhutan.
A further experiment on the effects of burning on the biomass production and oil yield of native lemon grass (C. flexuosus) was carried out on a 40-square-metre plot in Doyang, at an elevation of about 990 metres. The following results were obtained:

Palmarosa Oil
Source: Palmarosa oil is obtained from rosha grass (Cymbopogon martini var. motia). It is a tall, perennial, sweet-scented grass, which grows from about 1.5 to 4 metres in height. It can also be cultivated.
Distillation: The process is similar to that used for lemon grass.
Properties and uses: Palmarosa oil is a pale-yellow liquid with a characteristic geranium odour. Oil quality is based on the total geraniol content. Palmarosa oil is used as a base for perfumes and cosmetics, for flavouring tobacco, and in mosquito repellent ointments.
Leaf Oils
Winter Green Oil
Source: Commercial winter green oil is derived by water-distillation of the leaves of Gaultheria procumbens. Prior to distillation, the leaves are exposed to the enzymatic action of warm water. During this process, the aromatic chemical, methyl salicylate, is formed. Fresh leaves are practically odourless, containing no methyl salicylate whatever. Winter green oil, which was once popular and well-known in the perfumery industry, is becoming obsolete due to its substitution by synthetic methyl salicylate. The main producer of the oil is the United States.
Properties and uses: Winter green oil is a pale yellow or pinkish liquid of intensely sweet-aromatic odour and flavour. The oil is still used in pharmaceutical preparations as a flavour corrector. In candy, chewing-gum, tooth-paste, and other products, the oil has been completely replaced by synthetic methyl salicylate, which is much less expensive. The use of methyl salicylate in root-beer (an American carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage) has made its flavour extremely popular. Bhutan has nine species of Gaultheria as shown in Table 10.

Wood Oils
Agar Oil
Source: Agar oil is distilled from the resinous portions of the wood of Aquilaria agallocha. This resinous wood is traded under the names "agar," "aloe wood" or "eagle wood." The tree occurs in patches in Bhutan's southern hills, in Assam in India, and in parts of West Bengal. Very little is known regarding why irregular portions of dark wood, highly charged with oleo-resin, appear in some trees but not in others, especially in and around old wounds and hollows. It is known that resinous infiltration occurs because of fungal attack, but the specific fungus responsible for the formation of agar wood has not yet been identified. Attempts to impregnate trees by driving pegs from trees already containing agar wood into trees not yet infected have not been successful.
Only mature trees, 50 to 60-years-old and infected with fungus, are exploited. The average resin yield is 3-4 kilogrammes per tree. Agar wood is classified as either real agar or "chum" agar. The former is hard and brown, while the latter is soft and varies in colour from light yellow to almost white. True agar is largely used as such, while agar oil is almost entirely distilled from chum agar, which has no value as wood.
Distillation: The distillation process for agar oil consists of soaking agar wood in water for 60-70 hours. The wood is then disintegrated into powder in a chopper. The powdered wood, suspended in water to which 5 percent by weight of common salt has been added, is placed in a retort and heated over a furnace. The retort has a swan neck with a device for replenishing the water, without removing the lid, during distillation. A Florentine flask made of glass or copper constitutes the receiver for the distillate. Distillation takes 30-32 hours. Because distillation takes place at atmospheric pressure, the process of total exhaustion of the wood is lengthy. The oil boils at high temperatures and the distillation waters are cohobated (i.e., returned to the still and re-distilled) to produce a reasonable yield. The oil yield ranges from 0.75-2.5 percent of the wood.
Properties and uses: True agar is heavier than water and has a peculiar yet agreeable odour, comparable to sandalwood. It is highly prized and in great demand in Arab countries for burning as incense. "Agar-bathis," or incense sticks, are prepared from the exhausted and distilled agar wood. Agar oil is used for diluting perfume oil from sandalwood oil or vegetable oils. It is a valuable perfume-retainer and prized by perfumeries for blending in their high-grade perfumes.
The Bhutanese experience: Agar wood is still found in Bhutan's forests, though now considerably less abundant than it once was. Despite the Forest Department's vigilance, many trees have fallen to the poacher's axe. Agar is not presently being exploited commercially. Because of its high market value, however, a few trial plantations were established in Panbang and Samdrup Jongkha in the 1980s. These trial plantations have been successful in terms of growth, but efforts to inoculate the trees with infected branches have not been encouraging.
Oil from Other Sources
Pine-needle Oil
Source: Pine-needle oil is obtained not only from pine-needles (Pinus spp.), but also from the needles or leaves of various spruces and firs. Distillation of needles from young twigs and stems seems to yield higher levels of oil.
Uses: The oil is used for treating rheumatism and related complaints. In the perfumery industry, it is used in the manufacture of bath crystals and soaps. It is also used in hospital disinfectants and room sprays, deodorants, general disinfectants and similar products. Once the oil is recovered, the exhausted needles are used for a variety of purposes. "Pine wool," for example, is manufactured from the needles. This type of wool can be woven into fabrics, knitting yarns, quilts, etc.
Cedar Oil
Source: Cedar oil is manufactured by distilling shavings and sawdust from Juniperus macropoda (Indian Juniper, Himalayan Pencil Cedar). Following oil extraction, the shavings can be converted into linoleum. The potential for extracting cedar oil from J. recurva, which grows in Bhutan, should be explored.
Champ Oil
Source: Champ oil is extracted from the flowers of Michelia champaca, a large, handsome tree. The oil is obtained from the fragrant, deep yellow flowers by maceration or extraction.
Uses: The oil is one of the most famous perfumes of India and other Asian countries. It rivals ylang-ylang in its fragrant odour and is much used in the local perfume industry.
Calamus Oil (calamus perfume)
Source: Calamus oil is obtained from the rhizomes of the plant Acorus calamus through steam distillation. It contains the glucosidic bitter principle, "acorin." The plant is found in marshes up to 2,400 metres in altitude.
Uses: The oil is largely used in perfumery and also in spice blends and in the flavouring of alcoholic beverages.
Ginger Oil
Source: Ginger oil is obtained from the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale.
Uses: The oil is used in pharmaceutical preparations, and by the cosmetics and perfumery industries. A private project to produce ginger oil has been established in Samtse.
Keora Oil
Source: Keora oil is derived from the flowers of Pandanus tectorius (P. odoratissimus Roxb.), a small evergreen shrub, or small tree, with a many-branched stem, supported by a number of stiff aerial roots. The flowers are usually large - a single flower can weigh Up to 150 grammes - and powerfully fragrant. The flowers appear in July and the plant continues flowering till mid-December. Flowers are particularly abundant from August to September.
Uses: The oil is used in the preparation of cosmetics and perfumes.
Remarks
Bhutan has many potential sources for essential oils which have yet to be exploited. The main obstacles are lack of technical know-how and the paucity of information on the extent of the resources. The Ministry of Agriculture is now exploring the possibilities of tapping these various sources. They represent great potential as exports and future sources of foreign exchange earnings.
Rosin and turpentine
Background
Resins are obtained from mature chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) greater than 40 centimetres in diametre, using the "French cup and lip" method. Diagram 2 shows the distribution of chir pine forest in Bhutan. Trees above 70 centimetres in diametre are given two blazes per year. In Bhutan, tapping of chir pine is primarily carried out by Tashi Rosin & Turpentine, a branch undertaking of Tashi Commercial Corporation, under a 50-year lease running from 1972 to 2022.
Distribution and Resource Availability
An area of 420 square kilometres has been leased to Tashi Rosin & Turpentine Company. However, the company is only allowed to tap in the areas shown in Table 11.
Production
Bhutan's yearly resin production peaked at 1,760 tons in 1985. The tapping methods used, however, were not sustainable and were damaging to the country's delicate environment. Resin tapping rules have now been revised and, with better control over tapping methods, the yield has declined to a sustainable level of just 272 tons per year.

Source: Review on Resin Tapping Operations in the Chir Pine Forest of Bhutan., by M.R. Moktan, 1994.
Note: Bhutan's chir pine forests cover an area of approximately 810 square kilometres. Only about half of this area is tapped as the terrain is difficult for commercial extraction and the distribution of mature trees is widely scattered. The major obstacle Tashi faces at present is an insufficient number of labourers on a dependable basis. Rural Bhutanese are too occupied with their own fields during crop seasons, and tend to view resin tapping as a supplementary source of income normally pursued only during the agricultural off-season.
Processing
Resin collected from the various field depots is transported to the Rosin and Turpentine Factory in Samdrup Jongkha for processing into rosin and turpentine. The processing plant's production capacity is 300 tons of resin per annum (Master Plan for Forestry Development, Annex Report No. 8).
Production output:
Rosin
78 percent
Turpentine oil
14 percent
Waste
8 percent
All products are sold to India, with the price for rosin ranging from Nu. 20.00 (63 US cents) to 24.00 per kilogramme (76 US cents) and the price for turpentine oil at Nu. 11.00 per litre (35 US cents).
Uses
Rosin is used in the paper, paints and varnish, soap and ink industries. Turpentine is used in the production of camphor and paints, and in the pharmaceutical industry (Table 12).

The Economic Aspects of Resin Tapping in Bhutan
Under normal circumstances, one chir pine tree with one resin channel should yield 1.5 kilogrammes of resin per annum, if the work is carried out efficiently and the weather is favourable. But with Bhutan's shortage of trained labourers, difficult working conditions, and mountainous terrain, the yield is not more than 1 kilogramme per channel. As only trees above 70 centimetres in diametre have two channels, the large majority of Bhutan's chir pine trees have only one channel.
Given the above assumptions, the present economics of resin tapping in Bhutan are estimated as follows:

Vegetable oil and ornamental plants
Vegetable oil
Ornamental plants

The Royal Government of Bhutan
Vegetable oil
Bhutan has many trees and shrubs which are potential sources of oil in both the country's sub-tropical and sub-temperate zones. There are a few common species traditionally used by villagers in different parts of the country, but no systematic study has yet been carried out to survey Bhutan's potential for producing vegetable oil. The socio-economic and ecological attributes, and marketing needs associated with such production, have also not been studied.
Bhutan consumes a high level of vegetable oils. The country's requirements are largely met by imports from India and other countries. Coconut oil, soyabean oil, and mustard oil with the trade name "Dalda," for example, are all from India, while palm oil comes from Malaysia. Some 80 percent of Bhutanese rural communities cannot afford to buy even their basic requirements in vegetable oils because of their high cost, ranging from Nu. 40 (US$ 1.27) to Nu. 70 (US$ 2.22) per litre. This problem could be overcome by small-scale industries producing vegetable oil from locally-available species. Surpluses, could easily be marketed in neighbouring countries. The quantity and quality of production are the two main factors governing successful marketing.
The major problem presently is the lack of a proper study on the potential for vegetable oil production in the country. A full-fledged systematic study on vegetable oils would, unfortunately, entail large financial and human resource investments. It is therefore recommended that a proposal be submitted for initiating a pilot project, with the Government providing technological support and financial assistance to interested and innovative farmers.
Following is a list of known vegetable-oil-yielding forest species in Bhutan:
 gante, bandre, dhorkho-shing (Gynocardia odorata)
 yikka-shing, chiuri (Aesandra butyracea)
 panche-shing, gunilo-kharaney (Symplocos paniculata)
 sal, sakhuna (Shorea robusta)
Curcuma parviflora Wall is one of Bhutan's numerous ornamental plant species.
Here is a brief description of each species:
Gynocardia odorata R. Brown
Local name: Gante or Bandre (Nepal); Dorkho-shing (Sharchop-kha).
Family: Flacourtiaceae.
Distribution: Samtse, Lower Chhukha, Sarpang and Samdrup Jongkha Districts.
Altitude: 300-1,000 metres.
Climatic zone: Tropical and subtropical.
Morphology: Gante is a tree with thickly-spreading branches that grows from 10 to 20 metres high. Its leaves are dark green, coriaceous, and oblong - poisonous to cattle. Gante's flowers are yellow or yellowish green, appearing in April until late May. The tree can be easily recognised by its hard, round, dark-gray, rough-textured fruit, growing on its stems and main branches.
Silviculture: Gynocardia odorata species is light-demanding and needs little care. It grows mostly on sloping land at Bhutan's higher elevations or on stream banks and gullies where there are no other tall trees. Plantations can be established by direct sowing or by planting seedlings. Seedlings are grown in raised nursery beds or in polythene bags.
Extraction method: Oil is extracted from the seeds. The seeds are beaten into a pulp, heated, then compressed in tightly-woven bamboo baskets. Raw oil is boiled until it no longer foams. After cooling, the oil becomes white and semi-solid.
Other uses: The tree's fruit pulp is poisonous and is often used to kill fish. The seed is covered with a thick, edible pulp. The fruit is also used in Ayurvedic medicine. Oil from the Nepali gante is sold under the trade name "Chulmugra," common in India's Ayurvedic medicine market.
Aesandra butyracea Roxb.
Local name: Yika-shing (Dzongkha), Yi-shing (Kurtoep), Chiuri (Nepal), Pinshing (Sharchop-kha).
Family: Sapotaceae.
Distribution: Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang, Shemgang and Tsirang. Sparsely distributed in Punakha and Wangdue.
Altitude: 500-1,500 metres.
Climatic zone: Sub-tropical, sub-temperate.
Morphology: Yika-shing is a medium-sized tree that generally grows with a crooked stem. The leaves form large clusters and its bark is light gray. It has milky sap and its wood is pinkish-white in colour.
Flowering time: December-January.
Silviculture: Aesandra butyracea is a light-demanding species, with some tolerance to frost. It normally grows on sloping land with deep soil, and can easily be grown in nurseries. The number of seeds per kilogramme averages 450 to 600. The seed is viable for only a short period, so it has to be sown immediately after collection. Planting bare-root seedlings gives poor results, but seedlings grown in polythene pots perform well.
Extraction method: Vegetable butter is extracted from the seeds. The seeds are heated and mashed into a pulp. The pulp is heated in a pan and then compressed in tightly-woven bamboo baskets. After cooling, the oil becomes white and semi-solid. It is locally-known as "pins" in Sharchop-kha and "yiga makhu" in Dzongkha.
Other uses: In solid form, the oil is burned in lamps and used for making "forma" (images made during religious ceremonies). After extracting the butter, the remaining cake is toxic and is used as fish poison.
Symplocos paniculata
Local name: Pangtshe-shing (Dzongkha); Zim-shing (Sharchop-kha); Gunilo (Nepal).
Family: Symplocaceae.
Distribution: Punakha.
Altitude: 1,500-3,000 metres.
Climatic zone: Sub-tropical and temperate.
Morphology: Pangtshe-shing is a medium-sized tree, which grows from 5 to 10 metres in height. A deciduous species, its bark is ash-grey with vertical fissures. Old bark scales off naturally. Some villagers scratch off the dead bark, believing that this helps produce better fruit. The tree flowers in April and May. Its flowers are white. Its fruit is ready for harvesting by June or July.
Silviculture: Symplocos paniculata is a light-demanding species that mainly grows in valleys and on slopes with moist soil. Its seeds have low viability. The fruit is sown, without removing the pericarp, in nurseries immediately after collection.
Extraction method: Vegetable butter is extracted from the seeds. The seeds are heated and mashed to a pulp. The pulp is heated in a pan then compressed in a tightly-woven bamboo basket. After cooling, the oil becomes white and semi-solid.
Other uses: The oil is also burned in lamps. The leaves are used for making dye.
Shorea robusta
Local name: Sal, Sakhuna.
Family: Dipterocarpaceae.
Distribution: Grows naturally in Kalikhola Sarpang and is planted in other southern districts.
Altitude: 200-1,300 metres.
Climatic zone: Tropical and dry-sub-tropical.
Morphology: Sal is a large tree, with ovate-oblong leaves. Its bark has deep, vertical fissures. The tree flowers from March to April. Harvesting of fruit is from June to August. The fruit is winged and usually has only one seed.
Silviculture: Shorea robusta species needs well-drained soil. Sowing seeds directly into the plantation site immediately after collection yields the best results as the seeds cannot be stored for more than a week.
Extraction method: Not known.
Other uses: Excellent timber; essential and edible oils.
Ornamental plants
Domesticated ornamental plants are widely-known to Bhutan's rural folk and are, therefore, unnecessary to describe in detail in this document. Wild varieties of ornamental plants are also abundant in Bhutan. Identification and classification of such plants, with respect to their aesthetic, economical and environmental value, however, is yet to be carried out and almost no information on them exists.
The Japan-Himalayan Company is the pioneer in the ornamental plant business in Bhutan. Established in 1990, it is a joint business venture with Japanese counterparts. The nursery occupies more than 1.25 hectares, or about three acres, located after the Dzong going to Taba. It employs five workers, two trained in Japan. Four plastic-covered propagating chambers are used to produce rooted cuttings of the following plants: Agapitus, Begonia, Corpus, Capitata, Cupressus, Edgeworthia, Hedera, Gaultheria, Peonia, Piteris and Viburnum. These are exported to Japan for landscaping highways. So far, 5,000 cuttings have been exported to Japan, sold at 60 to 100 yen each (US$ 0.73 to 1.21 per cutting), depending on the size and extent of the root system development. The rooted cuttings are washed in the nearby river to remove all sand. The cuttings are then packed in moss and sent by air freight from Paro to Bangkok, and from there to Japan. A package of 100 plants weighs up to 2
kilogrammes.
The forests of Bhutan contain numerous species of rhododendron which are increasingly in demand as ornamental plants.
The Japan-Himalayan Company is now conducting experiments to determine which species are most easily propagated by various simple methods, with or without growth regulators. At present, the company gets 50 percent rooting success with Cornus, using a Japanese rooting hormone. It also claims that Cupressus multiplies faster using cuttings rather than germinating seeds.
The company's current problems are all related to rooting. These problems, however, should not be difficult to solve. Suggested priority activities are the following:
1) Construct a mist system over a well-drained propagating bed to provide continuous high relative humidity to cuttings. Heating may be needed during winter.
2) Experiment with various concentrations of growth regulators and soaking or dipping time in relation to the percentage of rooting/shooting.
3) Experiment with cuttings of different maturities, for example, terminal, sub-terminal or basal in conjunction with point
2) above to establish the combinations which will give the highest percentage and number of roots and shoots.
4) Look into other markets; study the quarantine rules for plant entry into other countries.
5) Send key personnel abroad for training to keep abreast of the most recent trends in the ornamental plant industry.
This information is based on the experiences of the Japan-Himalayan Company (Master Plan for Forestry Development, 1990). There is a need to appraise and document information from other sources, including villagers, city corporations, other government organizations, etc.
Overall, more comprehensive studies on occurrence, flowering time, durability of flowers, availability, propagation techniques, and marketing prospects for wild varieties of ornamental plants are needed.

Basic information on Bhutan's Himalayan yew (Taxus baccata)
Background
Conclusions
by Passang Wangchen Norbu
Assistant Director
Forest Inventory Unit
Forest Resources Development Section. Thimphu
The Royal Government of Bhutan
Local name: Yew (English), Keyrang-shing (Sharchop-kha), Dhengrey salla (Lhotsham kha)
Botanical name: Taxus baccata L.
Background
Officers and foresters from other parts of the Himalayas report that the Himalayan yew's foliage contains a chemical known as taxol, discovered only in recent years and now considered to be one of the most important drugs in the fight against cancer. Provided scientific principles are followed, foliage production can be maintained on a sustainable basis. Currently, however, there is little knowledge on the proper management of Bhutan's Himalayan yew. Given this shortage of knowledge, large-scale foliage collection at this juncture would do more harm than good and could even threaten the resource. Thus a conservative approach must be taken.
Morphology
The Himalayan yew is an evergreen tree, generally middle-sized, though sometimes quite large, with a large, spreading crown. Most yew trees tend to be forked, fluted, and with depressions at branch-stem junctions. This is not regarded as a defect (Evans, 1984). Its bark is reddish-gray, thin and smooth, and peels off in longitudinal shreds. Its leaves are 1.5-2.75 by 0.2-0.25 centimetres, usually curved, acuminate margins, slightly inrolled, dark-green and shining above, brownish-yellow and somewhat pale beneath, single nerved and narrowing into a short petiole.
Distribution
According to the Flora of Bhutan, Taxus baccata L. is the only representative of the Taxaceae family in Bhutan. On average, it is a tree of 5 to 12 metres in height. Taller trees grow to 12 metres or more. The tree occurs in scattered localities from Haa District in the west to Mongar District in the east. Reportedly, it also grows in the Kharungla area of Khaling and in the Zukpula-Menthongla belt in Wamrong, under Trashing District (author's personal communication 1992 and 1994).
The Bhutanese yew's habitat is characterised by moist, mixed coniferous forests or cool, broad-leaved forests, from 1,800 to 2,700 metres in altitude. Yew is also listed as one of the characteristic species of the "spruce forest" (2,700 to 3,100 metres) vegetation zone. Yew in Bhutan is best treated as a subspecies of zuccarini pilger (Taxus baccata var. wallichiana).
The extent of the area and forest types where yew occurs are furnished in Table 14.
Approximately 40 to 50 percent of the Himalayan yew's stems fall into the small diametre class of 10 to 20 centimetres. The yew growing stock for northwestern Bhutan is estimated at 1,459.7 cubic metres, equivalent to 1.1 percent of the total forest volume. The mean annual volume increment is estimated at 0.96 percent.

Total
As little is known about the proper management of Bhutan's Himalayan yew, foliage collection at this point may do more harm than good and even threaten the resource.
Yew growing stock for central and eastern Bhutan is estimated at 1,238 cubic metres. equivalent to 0.6 percent of the total. The annual volume increment is estimated at 0.76 to 1.5 percent. The total area of upland and lowland hardwoods is 1,385,940 hectares. This figure has not yet been separated into upland and lowland areas. Since the occurrence of yew is more likely in the upland areas, only upland hectarage is considered here. Only 15 percent of the total area is considered in estimating yew volume.
Regeneration
Yew has evergreen, needle-like leaves, but produces berry-like fruits instead of cones and is usually dioecious. Monoecious individuals occur very rarely. Like most trees, it does not produce a good seed crop every year. Visits to the yew growing areas of Bhutan reveal that there is a lack of natural regeneration. The reason for this is still unknown. Some believe that yak herders uproot the seedlings, as they are toxic to yaks, while others believe that intense browsing by yaks checks the growth of seedlings.
Himalayan yew has very thin bark and, as is the case with the Pacific yew found in northwestern United States, may be easily killed even by a light ground fire. The fruit is edible and ripens from October to November. Germination of the Himalayan yew is difficult and usually scarification is required to break the dormancy. Himalayan yew sprouts readily from stumps and cut branches. It can be propagated easily with stem and root cuttings.
Uses of Yew Wood
The sap wood is white; the heart wood is orange red, close-grained, hard, smooth, and elastic. It works and polishes extremely well, but is somewhat slow to season. The wood-is eminently suitable for cabinet work and other furniture. In some parts of India's Uttar Pradesh State, local people use the bark as a substitute for tea. In Bhutan, especially in the East, people use the wood for making milk and water containers.
Diagram 3 Yew Occurrence in Bhutan
Conclusions
Since all individual tree species, including yew, are routinely measured during forest management inventories, more information may be available from established forest management units. While processing the data from the Karshong Forest Management Unit of Bumthang District, for example, it was revealed that more yew occurred there than in the western districts.
More work is needed to screen existing databases and inventory reports to pinpoint the most important strata and individual plots where yew is found. Diagram 3 shows the probable areas where yew might be found. These areas are indicated on the map by dots. The density of dots and their number do not reflect the quantity of yew, but are exclusively an indication of the localities where yew occurs.
Different varieties of berries grow in Bhutan's forests. Some form a valuable food crop, others are used in making natural dyes.

Natural vegetable dyes
Edible products from forests - food, fruit species and mushrooms
Gums and waxes
Incense
by Sonam Tshering
Divisional Forest Officer, Sarpang
The Royal Government of Bhutan
Although Bhutan is largely covered with natural forests, a detailed survey of forest products has not been carried out. Hence accurate and authentic data on the various types of minor forest produce, such as edible products, dyes and wax, are still to be ascertained. Moreover, Bhutan has few industries or factories engaged in the collection and marketing of forest products. Collection and processing methods are still crude and traditional. Improving this situation would undoubtedly lead to an increase in both local and national revenue, as there are many abundant plant products that could be extracted. Other plants are simply not yet known and go to waste as their profitable use, if any, remains unknown.
Natural vegetable dyes
There are a number of dye-yielding plants in Bhutan (Table 15). Local people obtain dyes from plants and minerals by simple, traditional extraction methods. These dyes can be grouped into five categories: leaf dyes, bark dyes, flower and fruit dyes, stem and root dyes, and mineral dyes.
Leaf Dyes
Leaf dyes yield a variety of colours and are used by local people for dyeing hand-woven materials, a fairly large cottage industry in Bhutan. Species include Symplocos sp., Strobilanthes flaccidifolious, Holicia nilagirica and Indigofera.
Bark Dyes
These can potentially be extracted from species such as Terminalia tomentosa, Berberis nepalensis, Acacia spp., and Alnus sp. Due to a lack of knowledge and experience, however, only dyes from the bark of walnut trees and Berberis sp. are presently extracted by local people.
Natural dyes play an important role in making traditional Bhutanese fabrics.
Flower and Fruit Dyes
In Bhutan, flower and fruit dyes are the most important category of natural dyes. Most of the dye species are raised from seeds by rural people, then sold. Their fruit can be used as mordants. Particularly important are khomany-shing (Choenomeles lagenaria), robtangshing (Rhus similata), churoo, amla (Phyllanthus emblica), Cedrala toona, Michelia champaka and Mallotus phillipenensis. The dyes are normally used for colouring or dyeing silk clothes. Mallotus phillipenensis, for example, produces a red dye called "sinduri," which is commonly used in colouring cloth.
Stem and Root Dyes
Stem and root dyes are used for many varied purposes. Dyes from Curcuma longa are used for colouring foodstuff, from Acacia catechu for tanning and dyeing canvas and leather goods, and from jackfruit for dyeing robes for monks.
Mineral Dyes
Found throughout Bhutan, these dyes are obtained from natural mineral salts (dochur) and oxidized iron (marchelo).
Edible products from forests - food, fruit species and mushrooms
There are a number of plant species in Bhutan's forests whose fruits, seeds, tubers, roots, or stem parts are collected and consumed directly by the local people. The full extent of such use, however, has not yet been surveyed. A better understanding of the uses of such products would clearly lead to an improvement in the country's economic situation, particularly in rural areas.
A description of some of the species used as food follows (see also Table 16):
Food
 Wild yams (Dioscorea spp.) are found in abundance in southern Bhutan. The tubers are eaten once a year as part of a ritual. At times of famine, however, wild yams become a staple for those lacking other food. The tubers have an excellent taste. During difficult times even the bulbil, which is bitter, is eaten.
 Bamboo shoots are a common vegetable in Southeast Asia. Bhutan has many edible bamboo species. The roots are harvested during the rainy season - normally when they are about one foot high. The shoots are then boiled with wood ash to remove all poison. Without boiling, some bamboo shoots are extremely poisonous. Some bamboo varieties, however, do not have to be boiled.
 Elatostema spp. is consumed as a vegetable, known locally as "damroo."
 Algae (e.g., Ulva spp.) is mixed in curries.
 Tubers such as Dioscorea spp. and Alocasia spp. are eaten as vegetables.
 Jackfruit is also eaten as a vegetable.
 Oil can be extracted from sal seed and from Symplocos paniculata and consumed with ferns and other food.
Fruit
Forest fruit includes:
 pears (Pyrus spp.) - known locally as "phoetsi" in Dzongkha
 Eleagnus latifolia - small, red fruit
 "tong" in Dzongkha - somewhat like a pear (Docynia indica)
 "humpa" in Dzongkha (Citrus spp.)
 "nimbu" in Nepali
 Bel-Aegle marmelos - eaten after boiling
 wild banana (Musa spp) - the fruit is eaten raw; the flowers are eaten as vegetables
 mango (Mangifera spp.) - eaten as fruit
 beer (Ziziphus spp.) - grows mainly in Bhutan's southern riverine plains and degraded areas
 amla (Phyllanthus emblica)
 strawberries (Fragaria)
 "khalangji" (Solanum spp.)
 jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus)
Details of various other fruit species are given in Table 16.
Spices
Generally used as food flavouring agents. Many also have medicinal properties. Most important of all the spices found in Bhutan are cardamoms and peppers (Curcuma aromatic and Cinnamon zeylanicum). Other species include mentha, curry pasta (Murraya koenigii), Amaranthus spp. and Zanthoxylum spp. (see Table 17 for a detailed list of various Bhutanese spice species).
Mushrooms
Bhutan prizes its wide variety of mushrooms (Table 18). They come from both the country's tropical and temperate regions. More edible mushroom varieties are found in temperate regions than in tropical areas.
Some of the commonly eaten mushrooms are "jilli namcho" (Auricularia auricula), which grows on rocks and rotten logs; "jichu kangroo" (Calvaria spp.); "ga shamu" (Clitocybe odora); "sisishamu" (Cantherellus cibarius); "taa shamu" (Polyporus spp.); and "sangey shamu" (Tricholoma matsutake). Many varieties are marketed commercially.
Gums and waxes
Gums
Gums are translucent, amorphous exudations from the wounds of trees. Bhutan has not yet begun intensive gum tapping. Local people collect gum as and when required and the damage done to the trees is negligible. Gum (latex) from Ficus elastica is extracted for sealing bamboo baskets, and other bamboo work, using simple methods.
Commercial processing of gums has not yet begun. Bhutan's climate is favourable for the cultivation of gum trees, however, and the launching of such commerce would be beneficial to the whole country. Bhutan presently has only a few gum-yielding species (Table 19).
Trees from which the people extract gum include: brongshang (Ficus elastica), simal (Bombax ceiba), khair (Acacia catechu), and semla gum (Bauhinia retusa).
Waxes
Waxes are generally obtained from insect products, such as the honeycomb-cells of bees and wasps (Apis spp.). Local people collect honeycombs after the bees or wasps leave their nests. The empty combs are melted and all crude material removed. The wax is generally used for smoothing the thread when weaving cloth, or it is rubbed into the woven cloth to give it gloss and strength. Some waxes are now processed into candles, sealing materials, and other products (see Table 20 for a list of the various species found in Bhutan).
Quality mushrooms are one of the prime non-wood products of Bhutan's many forests.
Incense
Incense sticks are manufactured from many plant species which yield sweet scents (Table 21). Most people use the leaves, barks or whole plant directly as incense. In Bhutan, the demand for incense sticks for religious use is high. At least one large-scale factory is now manufacturing incense, in addition to many small-scale factories.
Some of the commonly used incense species are "shup" (Juniperus spp.), grown at high altitudes; "pang pee" roots (Nardostachys jatamansi); "sanze kachu" (Tancetum tibeticum); "poikar" (Cannarium sikkimensis); and Rhododendron spp. In the absence of these species, people use pine leaves or Artemisia spp. as incense.
The raw materials required by a typical incense industry are shown in Table 22.

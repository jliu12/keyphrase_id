Foreword
Since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has undertaken a number of technical assistance activities including regional workshops and national training seminars related to the impact of the UR and the need for follow-up action. Considerable experience was gained by these training activities on the types of problems faced by developing countries and on the need for analytical capacity building at the national and regional levels to address UR-related issues. In addition, these activities highlighted some of the policies needed to take advantage of market opportunities arising from the UR as well as those required to reduce the costs of adjusting to the changes brought about by the Agreement. This has been a valuable experience which is worth sharing with others.
This Manual is meant to contribute in that direction. It has been prepared jointly by the Policy Assistance Division (TCA) and the Commodities and Trade Division (ESC) of FAO as part of a series of training materials for use in programmes of capacity-building in policy formulation and analysis.
The Manual will help the reader understand the content of the Agreement on Agriculture and the main functions of the World Trade Organisation. More importantly, the manual is valuable to agricultural policy analysts in developing countries, as well as trade and macro-economic policy makers who need to assess the economic and administrative implications of the Agreement on Agriculture. In particular, the manual will, inter alia, help in the formulation of WTO-compatible agricultural domestic and trade policies, help in building the analytical capacity to investigate new trade opportunities and improve the understanding of the impact of the Agreement on a country's food security.
Further multilateral trade discussions are scheduled to begin in 1999, and all developing countries will be affected whether they are Members or not of the World Trade Organization. It is our hope that this volume will increase the awareness about UR issues and help prepare developing countries for future trade negotiations. FAO is committed to continue its technical assistance so that developing countries are well informed and equal partners in the reform process.
We wish to acknowledge with thanks all those who contributed to the preparation of the material in this Manual as well as the editors who assembled this volume.

Introduction
This manual should assist agricultural policy officials, as well as trade and macroeconomic policy makers, in developing countries to assess the economic and administrative implications of the Agricultural Agreement that emerged from the Uruguay Round of Multi-lateral Negotiations under the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade. In addition, the manual will bring the commitments undertaken in the Agreement into the context of key policy issues that have a profound influence on the agricultural sector, namely:
The Agreement on Agriculture is one of a number concluded at the end of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Negotiations. Other agreements were also of considerable importance but, in the case of agriculture, this was the first international accord of its kind and it was therefore of special significance. The same remarks apply to a 'sister' agreement, that on Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary measures. This may be of equal significance in the longer term. This Manual, however, is concerned with the Agreement on Agriculture.
Agriculture plays an important, if not pivotal role, in developing countries, especially those that are categorised as least developed, and as such it is vital that an understanding of the Agreement, and its linkages with agricultural, and general economic objectives, are widely appreciated.
The Manual is aimed at those working at a policy level in developing countries and aims to familiarise them with the Agreement on Agriculture and its likely impact on developing countries. It will be increasingly clear as you progress through the Manual that the impact on a particular country will be, in the majority of cases, unique and require careful examination. It is hoped that the Manual will facilitate such a process of country-specific examination.
Most developing countries are undergoing a process of economic reform, and in many developing countries this has been under the auspices of structural adjustment. In the case of the latter the reform process is, to a degree, externally generated. In light of this, we need to examine not only the impact the agreement is likely to have on trade and production policies, but we also need to examine the prevailing forces that affect policy internally. We hope that the reader is able to develop an understanding of the Agreement and to place this understanding into the context of the other influences which the Policy makers need to consider in agricultural policy formulation.
The main aims of this manual are to provide the reader with:
· An understanding of the Agreement on Agriculture.
· An understanding of the administrative and implementation procedures under the WTO.
· The information to assess the likely impacts on agricultural policy and trade in a particular developing country.
· An understanding of the linkages between internal agricultural policy reform and the external trading commitments which are binding.
· An understanding of the implications for food security.
· The constraints and opportunities for existing, and new, regional integration agreements.
The manual is divided into two Parts as follows:
Part I: The Agreement on Agriculture, discusses the content of the Agreement providing detail on the background to GATT and the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the Agreement on Agriculture. Chapters 1 and 2 detail the Agreement examining its content and implications respectively. Chapter 1 is supplemented by an Annex on the World Trade Organisation which, although not related to the general focus on agriculture, is an important organisation with respect to its functions and procedures
Part II: The Policy Implications for Agriculture after the Uruguay Round Agreements, investigates the policy implications stemming from the Agreement with respect to the new trading opportunities and the implications of changes in agricultural commodity markets; the domestic policy making environment which will experience the dual influences of the Agreement and structural adjustment; food security; and regional trading opportunities.

Þ Chapter 2 examines the main elements of the Agreement with particular attention to market access, export subsidies and domestic policy commitments.
Þ Chapter 3 gives a detailed account of the implications of the Agreement, under the general headings introduced in the previous chapter.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· A general understanding of the history of GATT, multilateral liberalisation and how agriculture had hitherto been excluded.
· An understanding of the detail of the Agreement on Agriculture with respect to developing countries.
· An understanding of the implementation issues associated with the Agreement, and of their relative importance to developing countries.

1.1.6 The effect of protectionism on producers in developing countries
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in Geneva in 1947 to create a framework that would regulate international trade and stimulate international commerce. The World Bank and the IMF, that were established at Bretton Woods in 1944 in order to deal with matters of international finance, were associated initiatives. In addition to the latter two organisations, policy makers also envisaged the formation of an International Trade Organisation (ITO), that would oversee international trade and enforce a framework of rules. A charter for the ITO emerged from a 1946 conference in Havana, although this was never ratified by member governments.
As a result, the GATT continued to be governed by "provisional" and "interim" measures, and remained an agreement without a formal organisation to enforce it. The signatories to the GATT, known formally as contracting parties (rather than members) applied the GATT according to the Protocols of Provisional Application (PPA), and the secretariat that administered the GATT kept the title of Interim Committee of the International Trade Organisation (ICITO). These "provisional" arrangements persisted up until 1994, when the Final Act of the Uruguay Round eventually brought the World Trade Organisation (WTO) into being.
1.1.1 Objectives and principles of the GATT
The objectives of the 1947 Agreement were to establish an orderly and transparent framework within which barriers to trade could be gradually reduced, and international trade thereby expanded. In order to facilitate this, the agreement contained within its text certain underlying principles and provisions that have been built upon over consecutive rounds of negotiation. The most important elements of the Agreement included those of:
Table 1.1 The Principles of the 1947 Act
Most Favoured Nation (MFN)
A fundamental standard of the GATT, each contracting party to the GATT is required to provide all other contracting parties with the same conditions of trade as the most favourable terms it extends, i.e., each contracting party is required to treat all contracting parties in the same way that it treats its "most favoured nation".
Reciprocity
The benefits of any bilateral agreements between contracting parties, regarding tariff reductions and market access, are extended simultaneously to all other contracting parties. The principle of reciprocity relates to the requirement to reciprocate the treatment provided by other contracting parties. It is closely associated with MFN.
Transparency
Fundamental to a transparent system of trade is the need to harmonize the system of import protection, so that barriers to trade can then be reduced through the process of negotiation. The GATT therefore limited the use of quotas, except in specific conditions widely used by agriculture.
Tariff reduction
When GATT was established tariffs were the main form of trade protection, and negotiations in the early years focused primarily upon tariff reduction. The text of the 1947 GATT lays out the obligations of the contracting parties in this regard.
Exceptions and Waivers
The agreement also recognised that there are circumstances in which strict adherence to these principles would be inappropriate. The GATT therefore provided for exceptions and waivers. In particular:
1.1.2 Achievements prior to the Uruguay round
The principal mechanism for progress on trade liberalisation within the GATT have been periodic multilateral negotiating rounds. In all, there have been eight such rounds, starting with the Geneva Round of 1947 that established the GATT, and concluding with the Uruguay Round that ended in 1994 after having established the WTO. The primary focus of the majority of rounds has been promotion of multilateral tariff reductions, and the extension of the agreed reductions to all members in accordance with the MFN clause. The achievements are summarised in Table 1.2.

1.1.3 The exclusion of agriculture from the GATT
The issue of agricultural sector trade was effectively excluded from the GATT at an early stage in the Agreement's life. The general consensus of opinion was that agriculture was a unique sector of the economy, that, for reasons of national food security, could not be treated like other sectors. With the expansion of the manufacturing economy, agriculture was in relative decline. Political and social pressures demanded, however, that the decline be halted or slowed down, and that agriculture be protected from the full rigours of the international market.
It was not until the Uruguay Round that agriculture, as a sector, was eventually placed firmly on the GATT negotiating table; although certain agricultural products did previously appear in the negotiations, as individual commodities. The Dillon Round succeeded, for example, in cutting tariffs on Soya beans, cotton, vegetables and canned fruit to very low levels, and the International Wheat Agreement and the International Dairy and Meat Agreement were negotiated under the auspices of the Kennedy Round. In general, though, agricultural commodities remained outside the negotiating agenda.
As a result, agricultural trade was accorded "special treatment" and was effectively exempted from some important GATT rules:
· Quantitative import restrictions, banned for all other commodities, could be used in the case of agricultural commodities, providing that domestic production of the commodity in question was also subject to certain restrictions, or to domestic price stabilisation or price support policies.
· The use of agricultural export subsidies was explicitly permitted, conditional upon the observance of "equitable" market shares; but "equitable" was difficult to define and agricultural export subsidies proliferated.
· Other mechanisms for protecting agriculture, such as variable import levies and domestic subsidies, were not explicitly covered by the GATT, and provided additional loopholes for agricultural policy makers wishing to protect the agricultural sector.
1.1.4 Protectionism and international tension over agricultural trade
The limited relevance of the GATT to agriculture led to increasingly high levels of protection and support for agriculture, particularly in industrialised countries, where the market share of many traditional suppliers of imports went into sharp decline. Some net exporting countries, such as the USA, sought to maintain their market share by resorting to export subsidy programmes, whilst those exporters that were unable or unwilling to do this, saw their market shares decline further. International tension and disputes over agricultural trade arose with increasing frequency, and GATT institutions were often used in an attempt to resolve these disputes. In fact, 60 percent of all trade disputes submitted to the GATT dispute settlement process between 1980 and 1990 were concerned with agriculture.
The protectionist policies of industrialised countries created large distortions in world food markets, depressing the world price of temperate agricultural commodities to uncompetitively low levels, and generating global market instability.
It was not until the opening of the Uruguay Round in 1986, however, that agriculture was placed finally on the negotiating agenda. The desire to reduce continual friction between the USA and the EC over agricultural trade was one of the main reasons why a consensus was eventually reached to bring agricultural trade into the regulatory framework of the GATT. Consensus over how this was to be achieved, however, was at this point still far away, and it took seven years of negotiation before an agreement was finally reached.
1.1.5 Reasons for inclusion of agriculture within the GATT framework
The economic rationale for bringing agriculture within the framework of the GATT revolved around:
The issue of comparative advantage in agricultural production
Government interventions in agriculture distorted agricultural production in many countries and generated high levels of inefficiency. High levels of support to farmers in developed countries generated large surpluses, which were sold on the world market through the use of export subsidies, often greatly depressing the world price of many agricultural commodities. The effect was to distort international patterns of production away from those dictated by comparative advantage.
· Countries with a comparative advantage in the production and export of tradable agricultural commodities were therefore unable to produce and export as much as they would have under a more liberal trading regime, and been deprived of substantial export revenues. At the same time, and with the assistance of substantial levels of government support, many countries with less comparative advantage had been producing at inefficiently high levels.
Instability in the world market for agricultural commodities
Since domestic prices in many countries, both developing and developed, had not been linked to world prices, the responses to changing international prices in both supply and demand that might have helped to dampen the annual world price fluctuations were absent.
· The variable import levies of the EC, that fluctuate according to movements in the world price, in order to maintain a fixed internal price, are a good example of how NTBs insulate producers from exposure to international prices, and exacerbate instability on the world market. Deficiency payments in other countries similarly isolated producers to a considerable extent from fluctuations in market prices.
1.1.6 The effect of protectionism on producers in developing countries
Agricultural protectionism also imposed implicit taxes on farmers in those countries where public sector support for farmers had been absent or negative. In developing countries, artificially low world prices created a downward pressure on domestic prices. This was frequently accentuated by domestic agricultural policies which effectively taxed producers.
· The resulting price disincentives often compromised agricultural production, threatened the livelihoods of large sectors of the population, whose incomes were derived from agriculture, and made many developing countries increasingly dependent upon cheap food imports. This was, however, often of benefit to urban consumers in these countries, one reason why these policies often lasted for many years.

1.2.2 The opening negotiating positions
1.2.3 Slow initial progress in the negotiations
1.2.4 The Dunkel Draft and CAP reform: Paving the way to an agreement
1.2.5 The Blair House Accord
The Uruguay Round was launched in 1986 by the Punta del Este Declaration, in which the negotiating objectives of the Round were laid out. The objectives with regard to agriculture were described as follows:
"to achieve greater liberalisation of trade in agriculture and bring all measures affecting import access and export competition under strengthened and more operationally effective GATT rules and disciplines"
An important element of the declaration was its explicit recognition of the effects that domestic agricultural policies have on trade. The Round would concentrate not only on the issue of border controls and export subsidies, but also on a broad range of domestic agricultural policy issues. Policies that subsidised producers would be subject to close scrutiny and negotiation.
1.2.1 The major actors and interests in the agricultural negotiations
The main actors in the agricultural negotiating group set up for the Uruguay Round were the USA, the EC and, to a lesser extent, the Cairns Group.
· The USA was enthusiastic about promoting greater liberalisation in agricultural trade, and was keen to reduce the protection and support enjoyed by producers in the EC under the CAP.
· The EC was much less amenable to far reaching liberalisation, but was keen to reach a workable compromise, that could be enshrined in the GATT, in order to minimise future trade friction between itself and the USA.
· The Caims Group consisted of 14 countries, from both the developing and developed world, whose membership comprised Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Fiji and Hungary. As net exporters of agricultural commodities they generally shared a common interest in desiring greater liberalisation in farm trade; the Caims contingent argued strongly for a reduction in the protectionism and domestic support measures enjoyed by farmers in developed countries.
Developing countries outside of the Cairns group also had a strong interest in the negotiations, although their influence over the proceedings was relatively minor.
· For the large group of developing countries which were net importers of food, the main concern was over the impact of the Round on the cost of food imports.
· Two other countries with a major interest in the outcome of the round were Japan and the Republic of Korea. These countries had highly protected domestic rice markets, and a strong domestic opposition to reform of the sector.
However, despite the importance of these other interest groups, discussions in the Uruguay Round were dominated by the differences between USA and the EC, the resolution of which determined the rate of progress towards an agreement.
1.2.2 The opening negotiating positions
When the negotiations on agriculture began, the positions of the EC and the USA were still very far apart. To emphasise its commitment to liberalisation the USA opened the negotiations with an unrealistic demand for the "zero-zero" option. Introduced in July 1987, this proposed that:
· All agricultural subsidies and all quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports be phased out over a period often years, and that world health and safety measures be harmonised.
This position found support amongst members of the Caims Group, which was itself proposing an immediate freeze on price support followed by the phased reduction of such support. The EC was, however, totally opposed to across-the-board reforms, and wanted instead to negotiate concessions on a commodity by commodity basis.
· The EC's demands focused primarily on the concept of "rebalancing", whereby access to the EC cereals market would only be negotiated in exchange for a concession that would allow it to reintroduce tariffs on non-cereal animal feeds. Tariffs for the latter had been bound at zero in an earlier round, and had since caused imported animal feeds to displace EC-grown cereals in the feeds used by EC livestock producers.
Japan, like the EC was keen to protect its farmers from international competition, particularly in the rice sector, for which it sought special treatment. This demand was made on the grounds that rice played a unique role in the diet, culture and environment of the country, and should therefore be treated differently from other agricultural commodities. Japan was, however, strongly in favour of measures to reduce export subsidies; as a net importer of agricultural commodities Japan would not find commitments in this area particularly demanding.
Meanwhile, the demands of developing countries were focused on their need for special and differential treatment within the negotiations. They emphasised the fact that agriculture plays a major role in the development of their respective countries, and that new GATT rules and disciplines should not inhibit agricultural growth by placing excessive constraints on government support policies.
The concern over the Uruguay Round's impact on those developing countries that were net importers of food, lay in the prospect that reduced surpluses in the North, resulting from a cut in permitted levels of agricultural support and export subsidies, would raise the international price of food, and, hence, the cost of importing it.
· Consequently, developing countries argued that the magnitude of cuts in support and protectionism affecting them, should be smaller than for developed countries, and that they be given a longer period of time in which to fully implement any policy changes.
1.2.3 Slow initial progress in the negotiations
At the mid-term review in Montreal at the end of 1988, the negotiating parties in the agricultural group were as far apart as ever, and they had failed to produce an interim text for discussion by the group at the Montreal meeting. Meanwhile the Caims Group refused to approve the draft texts of any of the other 14 negotiating groups until there was a text on agriculture. Following this failure, the main participants continued to search for a compromise:
· A breakthrough eventually came with the resumption of the mid-term review in April 1989. This culminated in the Geneva Accord, that saw the United States negotiators drop their demand for the zero-zero option, and led to the adoption of a series of short-term measures that involved a freeze in the current levels of domestic support, export subsidies and border protection.
The negotiating parties committed themselves once again to the long term objective of reducing government intervention in the above three areas of agricultural policy, and it was proposed that negotiations should proceed by seeking separate commitments in each of these three policy areas.
The EC and some other countries were reluctant, however, to adopt such an approach. The EC was particularly opposed to making substantial cuts in its export subsidies. Talks continued in the hope that an agreement could be achieved by December 1990, the original deadline for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round; but, the text presented there was rejected by the EC, and the deadline came and went without any agreement being reached. It was not until 1991 that the negotiators finally arrived at a consensus, whereby countries would agree to make concessions in each of the following three areas:
These areas eventually became the three main pillars of the final agricultural agreement. But, before that could happen the negotiators would have to establish the level of concessions that would be made, and that took two more years of tough negotiating.
1.2.4 The Dunkel Draft and CAP reform: Paving the way to an agreement
At the end of 1991 the director-general of the GATT presented a comprehensive Draft Final Act, known as the Dunkel Draft, in the hope of bringing the Round closer to a conclusion. The Draft covered agriculture, as well as all of the other areas under negotiation in the Round. It included the first complete text on agriculture, in which quantitative proposals were presented with respect to concessions in each of the three major disciplines.
It was internal pressure within the EC to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, that gave the GATT negotiations the momentum that they needed. The MacSharry plan for CAP reform, that was eventually adopted in May 1992, included proposals that would bring the EC's agricultural policy much closer to meeting the targets outlined in the Dunkel proposals.
· The most important element of the MacSharry plan with regards to the GATT was the proposal to substitute a certain amount of domestic price support with direct payments to agricultural producers, as compensation for lower farm prices. These direct payments were to be contingent upon the adoption by EC producers of production limiting measures that would reduce the area of land under agricultural production.
However, although the EC formally agreed to implement the MacSharry plan in May 1992, some obstacles to a GATT agreement still remained. The EC was still reluctant to make substantial cuts in export subsidies, and a question hung over whether the compensation payments of the CAP reform should be subject to domestic support reduction commitments.
1.2.5 The Blair House Accord
It was against this background that the American and EC negotiators undertook a series of bilateral discussions, that eventually led to an agreement, known as the Blair House Accord. The meeting that achieved this took place at Blair House in Washington in November 1992, and focused on making suitable amendments to the Dunkel Text. These amendments included the following:
The Blair House Accord broke the impasse in the agricultural negotiating group, and as the Uruguay Round drew to a close in December 1993. A consensus, on how to include agriculture within the framework of the GATT, and on the commitments that this would entail, was finally reached. The Agreement on Agriculture was included in the "Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations". Thus, agriculture became subject to GATT disciplines.

WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
This Chapter provides a brief overview of the main elements of the Agreement on Agriculture. It outlines, under the headings of Market Access, Domestic Support and Export Competition, the principle policy mechanisms which the Agreement is concerned to limit, and the main elements of the Agreement which are designed, in association with the presentation of Country Schedules, to achieve these objectives. A more detailed analysis of these elements, and how they concern developing countries in particular, is left to Chapter 3, which examines practical implementation issues, and looks at how the text of the Agreement can be interpreted.
THE AIMS OF THIS CHAPTER
· To provide an understanding of the main components of domestic support and their effects on production and trade.
· To review the mechanisms which most commonly impeded market access for agricultural commodities.
· To highlight the significance of agricultural export subsidies.
· To emphasise the importance of the Country Schedules in the implementation of the Agreement.
· To outline the elements of the Agreement governing market access, domestic support and export subsidies.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· The primary concerns of the Agreement.
· Types of intervention designed to provide support to domestic producers and the implications of such support.
· Types of intervention designed to place restrictions on imports and their implications.
· How such interventions may lead to domestic surpluses requiring export subsidies for their disposal.
· About the Modalities and Country Schedules.
· The provisions of the Agreement with regard to:
2.1 The objectives of the agreement on agriculture
2.1.1 Market access restrictions: Protecting producers from international competition
2.1.2 Domestic support policies: Their effect on production and trade
2.1.3 Export subsidies: Disposing of surpluses on the world market
The primary objective of the Agreement is to reform the principles of, and disciplines on, agricultural policy as well as to reduce the distortions in agricultural trade caused by agricultural protectionism and domestic support. These forces have become very strong in recent decades, as developed countries, in particular, have sought means of protecting their agricultural sectors from the implications of unfettered markets.
The purpose of the Agreement, then, is to curb the policies that have, on a global level, created distortion in agricultural production and trade. These policies can be divided into the following three categories: market access restrictions, domestic support and export subsidies. Each of these categories of policy making are dealt with in turn by different Articles and Annexes within the Agreement, and are referred to in the text as:
These Articles and other associated Articles and Annexes define which policies belong to which category, and set out rules regarding policy making in these areas. It is important to emphasise that the Agreement is a legal document, and that as such the definitions within it are of an objective nature. They are the legally binding consensus that was reached as a result of a lengthy negotiating process, in which many different definitions competed for recognition.
Before looking more closely at the Agreement's interpretations of the three main policy areas, it is worth taking a broader look at these policies, and at the rationale for subjecting them to GATT disciplines.
2.1.1 Market access restrictions: Protecting producers from international competition
The deployment of market price support policies can involve considerable cost, both to the taxpayer and to consumers, as in Europe and Japan, for example, where the agricultural support policies place a particularly heavy burden on the consumer.
· The maintenance of a positive price differential between the domestic market price and the world market price of farm commodities forces domestic consumers to pay higher prices for food commodities than they would in a more liberal marketing environment.
For an exporting, or potentially importing country to maintain support to domestic producers through market price support, some corresponding measures to restrict market access are necessary. These are import restrictions that limit foreign producers access to the domestic market and deny consumers access to agricultural commodities at the lower world market price.
Restrictions on market access typically take the form of:
The latter include, for example, complicated, time-consuming bureaucracy and restrictive licensing procedures, all of which can serve as an effective impediment to trade. Some non-tariff-barriers (NTBs), such as import quotas and variable levies, are particularly distortionary, in that they isolate domestic producers from the effects of world prices and therefore magnify instability on international market.
2.1.2 Domestic support policies: Their effect on production and trade
Domestic support policies include a variety of measures aimed at raising the income of producers and sustaining the profitability of domestic farming.
The policies that have the most distortionary effect on trade are those that provide farmers in the major producing regions of the world with a strong incentive to produce substantially more of a particular commodity than they would do without such policies. Income support policies that supplement a farmer's income through direct payments, so as to provide him or her with a guaranteed minimum income, do not generally have this effect, especially in the short run.
The following policies frequently do have a distortionary effect.
· Market price support: this is support which raises the domestic market price above the world market price so that producers receive more for their output than they would under free-market conditions. It may be brought about through:
Government intervention in the domestic market usually involves the government purchase of farm production in order to maintain a minimum guaranteed price. Thus, when the market price starts to fall below a certain threshold the government or its agencies step in and buy the product at the minimum guaranteed price.
On their own, border controls are only likely to be effective in providing market price support if the country is a net importer, of more than marginal quantities, of the commodity in question. In the case of an export tax, of course, governments intervene at the border in order to acquire tax revenue. If the commodity is also consumed domestically, this could depress the domestic price by reducing the volume of exports.
Agricultural policy is usually characterised by a combination of both government intervention of the type described and border controls, since to use either of these interventions in isolation would be likely to lead to a leakage of support to those for whom it was not intended.
It is important to remember that discussion of market price support in the Agreement, refers only to support prices that are administratively set by government; it does not include price support that is achieved through import barriers alone.
· Deficiency payments: These are direct payments to farmers, made in order to close the gap between a low market price and a guaranteed minimum price, as set and administered by the government.
As with market price support, these payments ensure that the producer's revenue per unit of production is higher than would be the case without government intervention. For, a given administered price, this form of support places less of a burden on domestic consumers.
· Input subsidies: These may be implemented in a variety of ways, all of which have the essential effect of reducing the unit cost faced by producers in their use of farm inputs. They allow farmers to produce more with a given amount of financial resources than would be the case without such subsidies.
In developed countries, the above policies have had a dramatic effect on the volumes of domestic agricultural production, and in the EC and the USA, for example, they have helped generate large agricultural surpluses. It is often argued that the increased volume of domestic production substitutes for imports in domestic markets, while the concomitant, and frequently subsidised, exports create 'unfair' competition for producers elsewhere.
Box 2.1: Domestic Support in the EC
In the mid 1970s the EC was a net importer of cereals, producing about 120 million tonnes of cereals each year, with net imports of approximately 15 million tonnes. By the early 1990s, the market price support policies of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) had helped push production up to 165 million tonnes per annum, turning the EC into a net exporter of cereals producing an annual export surplus of 25 million tonnes. At the same time, the EC became a major importer of grain substitutes. Policy incentives to raise the volume of production, such as those provided by the CAP, have clearly had a major impact on international agricultural trade:
2.1.3 Export subsidies: Disposing of surpluses on the world market
As has already been suggested, policies that provide substantial support to domestic producers frequently result in the production of large domestic surpluses. For example, in many developed countries where the response in demand as a result of price and income changes is small, i.e. demand is price or income inelastic, the volume of a commodity produced by domestic farmers in response to price support, quickly outweighs the volume purchased by domestic consumers. The problem then is how to dispose of such surpluses.
· Where the domestic price of the commodity is higher than the world price of the commodity, the sale of surpluses on the world market can only occur at a loss unless the exporter is provided with a subsidy.
Such export subsidies have been typical of the path chosen by governments in their efforts to dispose of domestic surpluses. It is these subsidies that have facilitated the sale of large EC and US surpluses on the world market, causing the international prices of many agricultural commodities to be depressed and accentuating world price instability.
2.2 The main elements of the agreement
2.2.1 The country schedules
2.2.2 Market access
2.2.3 Domestic support commitments
2.2.4 Export subsidy commitments
2.2.1 The country schedules
Most focus and interest obviously falls on the three categories of policy making outlined, especially since these are addressed explicitly by different sections in the text of the Agreement. However, it should be remembered that the Agreement was not the only legal document to come out of the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture. Although, the Agreement lays out the basic rules and definitions regarding policy making, it does not include within it specific quantitative commitments on a country by country and commodity by commodity basis.
· These quantitative commitments were a major objective of the Uruguay Round negotiations, and are stipulated in the Country Schedules, that each signatory to the Agreement has been required to submit.
The country schedules comprise a statement by each member government, on a commodity by commodity basis, of their position on each of the issues concerned (tariffs and NTBs, domestic support and export subsidies) prior to the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, together with an outline of how the provisions will be achieved. The rules governing how the Country Schedules should be created were laid out in a document entitled the Modalities for the Establishment of Specific Binding Commitments Under the Reform Programme, generally referred to as the Modalities.
Having presented the Country Schedules, a period of time was demarcated during which any member could question and seek to change the content of any other member's schedules. This period was described as the verification process. The period that commenced in December 1993, following the adoption of the Uruguay Round Agreement, and ended in April 1994, shortly before the Marrakech Ministerial Meeting, was allotted to this process, i.e. for countries to have the opportunity to examine, and negotiate amendments to, each others' proposed Schedules. However, it would seem that only very few such amendments were actually made to the Schedules during this time.
· Once the verification process was complete the Schedules were submitted to the GATT (Least-developed countries were given an additional year to do this, their dead-line being extended to April 1995), and from that time on they became legally binding. At the same point in time the Modalities ceased to be legally binding, and any irregularities concerning the manner in which the Country Schedules were drawn up could no longer be challenged with reference to the Modalities.
The Country Schedules are an essential part of the Agreement, and the text makes frequent reference to the commitments made within them: for example to reduce tariffs on particular commodities by a given amount over the required time period. Once the commitments have been made, there is a legal obligation on the part of member governments to implement them.
· The commitments made in the country schedules are to be made over what is known as the implementation period. For most, though not all, commitments this is defined in the Agreement as a six year period beginning in 1995, for developed countries, and a ten year period, commencing at the same time, for developing countries.
We will now consider the main elements of the three categories of policy described above, in terms of the technical requirements placed on governments. A more detailed appraisal of the policy implications of these provisions is left to the following chapter.
2.2.2 Market access
The provisions and commitments defined by the Agreement and the Country Schedules with regard to Market Access include a number of important elements. These can be roughly divided into the following four areas:
Tariffication, which is the obligation to convert non-tariff-barriers (NTBs) to trade into tariff equivalents.
Tariff reduction.
Market access provisions, that oblige countries to provide "low" import tariffs for a fixed quota of imports.
Special treatment and special safeguard provisions, that provide exemptions from the above commitments.
Tariffication and tariff reduction
Tariffication, or the replacement of NTBs by tariffs, is an important part of agriculture's inclusion within the framework of the GATT, in that it brings agricultural trade policy into line with the GATT principle of transparency, and potentially eliminates some of the distortionary effects that NTBs have on trade. The Agreement has the following provisions:
In cases where there were no NTBs at the start of the Uruguay Round, the value of the baseline tariff was taken to be either the customs duty that was prevailing at the beginning of September 1986 (the start of the Uruguay Round), or where this was lower than an existing tariff binding/commitment, the value of the latter.
For developed countries by an unweighted average of 36 percent, and subject to a minimum reduction of 15 percent in each tariff line over a six year implementation period.
For developing countries the commitments are 24 percent and 10 percent respectively, and the implementation period extends to ten years.
For least-developed countries there are no reduction commitments.
These figures were stipulated in the Modalities, whilst the resulting tariff rates for each commodity, and therefore the minimum reductions to which they must be subject, are stated in the legally binding Country Schedules. At the end of the implementation period all tariffs are bound at the final level, and in future may not, except under specific circumstances be raised above these levels.
Market access commitments
Market access provisions are an important element of the Agreement. These are designed to encourage the development of trade, and to ensure existing export markets are maintained. Thus, where there is little existing trade (taking the base period average as the benchmark), or where existing levels of imports are not maintained, importing countries are required to allow stipulated quantities of imports at a reduced rate of tariff. Thus, the market access provisions allow for the following:
These market access provisions do not apply when the commodity in question is a traditional staple of a developing country. Provided that certain conditions are met, a different set of provisions apply which give governments greater flexibility with regard to what are described as sensitive commodities. These arrangements are discussed in the next chapter. Also reviewed are the mechanisms for providing the opportunity for market access, particularly the implementation of import quotas at reduced tariff levels.
2.2.3 Domestic support commitments
As suggested in Chapter 1, in order to limit the trade distortions caused by domestic agricultural support policies the Agreement introduces commitments intended to curb these policies. These commitments on domestic support are aimed largely at developed countries, where levels of domestic agricultural support have risen to extremely high levels in recent decades. This constraint on policy design is to be achieved by:
For developing countries, where agricultural support policies are deemed to be an essential part of a country's overall development, the obligations are generally less demanding.
The aggregate measure of support
This concept is a measure that quantifies, in monetary terms, certain aspects of the support provided by agricultural policies. The AMS calculation includes all domestic support policies that are considered to have a significant effect on the volume of production, both at the product level, and at the level of the agricultural sector as a whole. Market price support, except that which is achieved through border controls alone, is a major component of the AMS calculation.
The AMS is calculated by first deriving the levels of support for each commodity, plus a similar calculation for non commodity-specific support. Each of these is then summed to provide the aggregate measure. Apart from those polices which are included in the calculation, there are a large number which are excluded. Whether or not these have, in reality, a significant effect on production is, in some cases open to interpretation. Policies are categorised as follows:
The 'green box'
'Green box' policies include a variety of direct payment schemes, that subsidise farmers incomes in a manner that is deemed not to influence production decisions. They also include assistance provided through:
Þ research, training and extension;
Þ marketing information;
Þ certain types of rural infrastructure.
From the point of view of developing countries exemptions relating to food security, domestic food aid and the environment are of particular interest.
The 'blue box'
Most of the exemptions to AMS commitments are policies placed in the 'green box'. Some additional polices also gain exemption, however, as a result of the accord reached at Blair House. These are the so-called 'blue-box' polices. The most notable of these are the compensatory payments and land set-aside programme of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States' deficiency payments scheme. Such direct payments under production-limiting programmes are exempted from AMS reduction if:
'De minimis' exemptions
As noted above, AMS calculations are carried out for each commodity and for no-specific support. The 'de minimis' exemption allows any support for a particular commodity (or nonspecific support) to be excluded from the total AMS calculation if that support is not greater than a given threshold level. Thus, an additional exemption is contained in the provisions of the Agreement, in the following circumstances:
The total AMS and reduction commitments
For evaluating the level of support that is provided to the agricultural sector, the Agreement refers to four different measures of support. These can be summarised as:
The domestic support commitments are defined in the Modalities as requiring a 20 percent (13.3 percent for developing countries) reduction in the Base Total AMS, to take place in equal annual instalments over the implementation period.
The resulting domestic support reduction commitments are included in the Country Schedules. To ensure that annual reduction commitments are being complied with, Current Total AMS values are established in each year of the implementation period.
2.2.4 Export subsidy commitments
As we discussed in the opening chapter, the subsidised export of agricultural surpluses has been a major source of international trade disputes, and the distortions that it has created on world markets, in terms of price and general market instability have been substantial. It is partly for this reason that the Agreement reached on export subsidies is seen by many to be the most important element of the Agreement, and likely to have the most immediate and direct impact on world markets.
Although agriculture does still receive special treatment in the area of export subsidies, in that, unlike in the trade of other commodities, export subsidies are still permitted, the Agreement did introduce constraints on such policies, where previously there were none. The essence of the Agreement with regard to export subsidies is as follows:
Reduction commitments
The schedule for implementing cuts appear in the Country Schedules. These specify:
These commitments are given for both the value of subsidy expenditures, (expressed in US$) and in the volume of subsidised exports (in tons).
Commodities are grouped for the calculation of export subsidies. The reductions apply to each group. These are listed in the table below:
Table 2.1: Commodity Grouping for Export-Subsidy Commitments
Wheat & Wheat Flour
Coarse grains
Rice
Oilseeds
Vegetable Oils
Oilcakes
Sugar
Butter and butter oil
Skim milk powder
Cheese
Other milk products
Bovine meat
Pig meat
Poultry meat
Sheep meat
Live animals
Eggs
Wine
Fruit
Vegetables
Tobacco
Cotton
The base period
The base period for the purpose of the export subsidy commitments is different from the 1986-88 base period relating to commitments on market access and domestic support.
However, an exception to this was negotiated between the US and the EC, under what was called the "front loading" accord, which was reached in December 1993, just before the conclusion of the Round. This allowed that:
This was permitted provided that by the end of the six year implementation period, the cuts still brought subsidies down to the level that would prevail had the base period level been used as a starting point.
The Agreement came about because in some cases export subsidies had continued to increase substantially following the 1986-90 base period, and it was felt that a sudden cut to the base period level would have been too demanding. The result was that while the overall cut in export subsidies, under these arrangements, will have to be larger, the impact of the reduction at the beginning of the implementation period is minimised.

Checklist for chapter 3
WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
The purpose of this chapter is to look in detail at the Agricultural Agreement and the implications it has for agricultural and trade policies in developing countries. The chapter will examine the differential treatment that developing countries receive under the agreement, it will provide a guide to using and interpreting the agreement, and will examine to what extent full compliance with the agreement will affect existing agricultural policies in the developing country context.
Following the introduction, this chapter is divided according to the main sections of the Agreement, that is, market access, domestic support commitments and export subsidies. Each of these sections acts as a guide to the relevant Articles and Annexes of the Agreement, examining how the various paragraphs and clauses should be interpreted, and highlighting areas where developing country commitments are different from those of developed countries. Each section will look at the policy implications of compliance, both during the implementation period, and beyond. The chapter will pay particular attention to some of the practical details involved in complying with the Agreement, such as, for example, how to calculate an AMS, or how to establish the permitted level of additional tariff under the Special Safeguards provisions.

3.1 The general implications of the agreement for developing countries: Special and differential treatment
The Agreement is likely to affect agricultural policies in developing countries in a number of ways. In the first instance, some areas of domestic agricultural policy and trade policy in developing countries will need to be modified in order to comply with the Agreement's provisions. It is these direct implications that will receive emphasis in the current chapter. The Agreement will also influence the agricultural policies of developing countries in a less direct way. This will occur, firstly, as a result of the Uruguay Round's impact upon the policies of the 'rest of the world', particularly, those of the developed countries; and, secondly, as a result of the impact on world markets and world prices, that reforms in the policies of the rest of the world will have. In the long term, changes in world markets and prices will provide new opportunities, as well as certain costs, that agricultural policies of developing countries will have to respond to. Changes in world market
prices will, for, example influence the profitability of different commodity sectors, which may in turn, affect public sector investment policies. Analysis of these wider implications is, however, left until a later chapter, and for now we shall concentrate on the more immediate effects of the Agreement.
Before looking in more detail at the Provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, it is useful to review the ways in which the provisions differ for developing and least developed countries compared to developed countries. This 'Special and Differential Treatment' as far as the Agricultural Agreement is concerned is introduced in Article 15. Thus:
· The Agreement has maintained the principles of Special and Differential Treatment for developing countries, introduced in earlier rounds of the GATT.
· It maintains and reinforces the distinction between Developing Countries and Least-Developed Countries, that was initially made during the Tokyo Round.
It is now commonly accepted that disciplines of the Uruguay Round Agreement, affecting as they do many previously unregulated areas, have introduced a vast array of obligations that did not previously exist. At the same time, it has been recognised that the ability to meet these new obligations varies considerably from one country to another, and that while full participation in the new commitments may be appropriate for the more developed countries, it may not be so for less developed countries.
As a result, many of the new agreements, including the Agreement on Agriculture, contain within them provisions that differentiate the rights and obligations of member countries, according to whether they are developed, developing or least-developed. In general, developed countries are expected to participate fully in the new disciplines, while for developing countries the commitments are less demanding.
The UN definition of a least-developed country is the one used by the WTO. There are, nevertheless, some problems with this definition, since it is not designed to measure trade competitiveness and excludes some low-income countries that probably should be included. Greater ambiguity exists over the definition of a developing country, and this could possibly be a source of contention in future trade disputes. The principle followed in the GATT/WTO is that of self designation. In agreeing the schedules countries opted to be included in one category or another. However, the ultimate designation was potentially the subject of negotiation, and therefore of influence, by other member states.
The sections which follow will look in detail at the commitments of developing and least-developed countries with regards to the relevant provisions on market access, domestic support and export subsidies.

3.2.1 Tariffication and tariff reduction
3.2.2 Minimum access commitments
3.2.3 Special treatment
3.2.4 Special safeguards provisions
3.2.5 Market access commitments: Implementation issues and policy implications
As discussed in Chapter 2, the main elements of the Agreement's provisions on market access relate to tariffication, tariff reduction, minimum access commitments and a number of exemptions. The associated provisions and commitments are documented in the text of the Agricultural Agreement itself, in the Modalities and in the relevant Country Schedules. The first and the last of these are legally binding documents, whilst the Modalities were only binding up until the point at which the Country Schedules were submitted to the WTO.
In the Agreement itself the main article on 'Market Access' (Article 4) is short, and is limited to just two paragraphs. The first of these is concerned with tariffs and merely refers to the Country Schedules in which the legally binding commitments on tariff bindings, and reductions, as well as minimum access concessions, are to be found. The implication of this is as follows:
· The exact value of the tariff commitments in the Schedules should have been established by each country in accordance with rules laid out in the Modalities, and that even if the Modalities were not strictly followed, the resulting Country Schedules are still legally binding.
The second paragraph is also very short, and is concerned with NTBs. It requires that:
· Member states restrict their use of import barriers to the tariffs specified in their Country Schedules, forbidding countries from using non-tariff barriers to trade, except for those exempted according to the provisions of Article 5 and Annex 5.
Article 5 is concerned with the Special Safeguard Provisions and Annex 5 with Special Treatment. The former allow countries, under particular circumstances, to raise tariffs above the level stipulated in their Schedules, while the latter permits a country to retain NTBs for certain sensitive products. Details of these exemptions are discussed below. The prohibited NTBs are provided in a footnote to Article 4, Paragraph 2 and are as follows:
3.2.1 Tariffication and tariff reduction
We will now look at the essentials of the market access provisions in more detail. Thus we focus on the process of tariffication, and the concept of the base rate of duty. The way in which tariffication has been carried out has been criticised by some commentators, as have the implications of the manner in which the base rates of duty have been calculated.
The base rate of duty for tariffied commodities
The obligation to convert NTBs into tariff equivalents applies to all member states, including developing and least-developed countries. This tariffication process involves converting the average rate of protection provided by NTBs during the base period (1986-88), into a tariff equivalent, and thereby establishing a base rate of duty for each product covered by the agreement.
Box 3.1: The Mechanism for Converting NTBs to Tariff Equivalents
The tariffication procedures were outlined in the modalities: the conversion of an NTB into a tariff involves calculating the 'price wedge', i.e. the difference between the domestic price and an international reference price at any point in time. Another way of describing it is that it attempts to evaluate the effect on prices of an NTB by comparing the domestic prices of an import with, and without the NTB.
A proxy for the 'without' case is the world price. Ideally one would use the domestic and the invoiced price of the imported product, i.e. a comparison of what the commodity costs the importer, and the price at which it is sold on the domestic market. In many cases, however, it may be impossible to distinguish between the domestic price of the import and that of the equivalent domestically produced product, so generally the domestic price of the commodity is taken, without distinguishing whether it refers to the import or the import substitute.
The formula will be:
Where
T = the Tariff equivalent,
Pd = the domestic price; and
Pw = the adjusted c.i.f. price
This is the ad-valorem tariff equivalent. To arrive at the base rate of tariff the ad-valorem equivalent would be calculated for each year of the base period and the average taken.
The base rate of duty for products which are previously subject to a tariff
For previously bound tariffs, that is those with an upper ceiling, the base rate of duty is determined by this previous bound level. For unbound tariffs the situation is slightly different. Thus:
All signatories should have completed this process before submitting their Schedules to the GATT, with the resulting base rate of duty for each commodity listed in the relevant column of the Country Schedules.
The bound rate of duty
The bound rate of duty is listed in the Country Schedules in an adjacent column to the base rate of duty. This the level at which the final tariff for a particular product should be bound. It is, in other words, the maximum tariff that may be applied from the point of time at which it comes into effect.
The bound rate of duty for each product is the result of a reduction in the base rate of duty. It is established by:
There are two cases where members are not required to reduce their base rates of duty:
Again, it should be noted that the bound rate of duty stipulated in the Country Schedule is legally binding, however it might have been calculated in practice.
The implementation period
The year in which the bound tariff becomes effective, again, depends upon the commitments made in the Country Schedule.
The sequencing of the reduction commitments as applied to tariffs should be implemented, according to Paragraph 7 of the Modalities, in equal annual installments. At the same time, it is worth noting that many developing country Schedules do not include annual commitments, but simply refer to reduction commitments being implemented over the 1995-2004 implementation period. It is worth remembering here that it is the Country Schedules rather than the modalities which are the legally binding documents.
3.2.2 Minimum access commitments
Details on how the level of minimum access commitments should be established were given in the Modalities rather than the Agreement itself. Since, as mentioned above, the modalities ceased to have any validity once the Country Schedules were accepted, the legally binding minimum access levels are now determined entirely by the extent to which the provisions of the Modalities were translated into commitments in the Country Schedules.
Where there were no significant imports, the Modalities obliged countries to provide minimum access opportunities, that would allow exporters of tariffied products (products that have undergone tariffication) to supply at least 3 percent of domestic consumption at the beginning of the implementation period, rising to 5 percent at the end of the implementation period, i.e. by 2004.
This implies that a proportion of the imports of a commodity which had previously been subject to NTBs would be allowed into the importing country at a reduced tariff rate. This quantity would be a minimum of 3 percent of the value of domestic consumption in 1995 at the beginning of the implementation, rising to 5 percent by 2004. Hence:
Compliance with minimum access provisions has generally involved the specification in the Country Schedule of an initial tariff rate quota (TRQ) and a final TRQ for each tariffied product involved.
These arrangements are laid out in the Country Schedules as follows:
In fact, the provisions on minimum access are somewhat ambiguous and have been interpreted in a variety of different ways:
However, the intention of the Agreement was also to protect the exports of existing exporters; i.e. to safeguard current access.
These arrangements are protected by the Agreement. They are different from the minimum access quotas, in the sense that they are not offered on an MFN basis. Nevertheless, they have been included in the quotas specified in the Country Schedules, with appropriate notes on which exporters enjoy the quotas.
These arrangements are different to the minimum access provisions. Where, previously, there was no market access, the minimum provisions have been agreed, but this is separate from any arrangements regarding current access. The two are not cumulative. It is possible, however, that minimum access quotas could be used to maintain existing bi-lateral agreements, rather than to offer concessionary tariffs on a MFN basis.
There is also uncertainty surrounding the procedures for allocating minimum access (rather than current access) quotas:
The auction of such quotas may offer a more equitable solution; but, the price that is paid for auctioned licenses imposes an additional levy on trade, and could be construed as being in breach of WTO/GATT rules. These are issues that WTO still has to resolve.
3.2.3 Special treatment
The paragraphs regarding Special Treatment are found in Annex 5 of the Agreement. As has already been mentioned, circumstances do exist under the Agreement in which countries have been permitted to exempt certain products from tariffication commitments: the major exemption is that developing countries that had unbound ordinary tariffs, could offer tariff bindings instead of going through the process of tariffication:
· A further exemption is a concession that was negotiated towards the end of the Uruguay Round, primarily as a result of the reluctance on certain Asian countries, Japan and the Republic of Korea in particular, to liberalise trade in rice.
Annex 5 describes the further conditions under which countries have been permitted to continue using non-tariff barriers to trade. Special Treatment, as this exemption is called, is only allowed for products that have been specifically mentioned in the Country Schedules as deserving such treatment (i.e. marked with the symbol 'ST-Annex 5').
Section A of the Annex describes the general conditions for the exemption designed to allow the maintenance of NTBs in certain circumstances. The provisions specify a range of criteria which have to be met concerning the proportion of imports in consumption (i.e. less than 3 percent), the provision of enhanced minimum access commitments and the use of particular domestic and trade policies. In particular, effective production restricting policies must be in place, and no export subsidies must have been used since 1986.
· Any agricultural commodity or product is included in the provision, although Section B of the Annex modifies these conditions in the case of developing countries, which may apply for Special Treatment under less demanding minimum access conditions if it concerns a primary agricultural product that is the predominant staple in the traditional diet of the country.
The effect of Section B is to provide developing countries wishing to protect sensitive agricultural commodities behind non-tariff barriers, with greater protection than would be the case under section A. At the same time, it was always unlikely that any developing countries would be applying production restricting measures for their basic foods, and thus be in a position to make use of this exemption.
3.2.4 Special safeguards provisions
Another important exemption from the usual market access commitments is the inclusion of Special Safeguard Provisions (SSP), described in Article 5 of the Agreement. This can be applied in two circumstances:
In both cases, normal tariffs may be supplemented by additional duties when actual import volumes rise above a specified Trigger level (Paragraph 1.(a)), or when import prices, denominated in domestic currency, fall below a certain trigger level (Paragraph 1.(b)).
In order to apply this concession to a particular commodity, the commodity must be marked in the Country Schedule with the symbol "SSG" (paragraph 1). Apart from the 'triggers' or conditions which merit the use of this concession, the limitations in its use are as follows:
Quantitative trigger level
The formula describing the method for calculating the quantitative trigger can be found in Paragraph 4 of Article 5. It is described below.
Box 3.2: Quantitative Trigger Levels
The following paragraphs provide the formula for establishing the quantitative trigger level (the level of imports) at which additional duties over and above the normal bound tariff may be deployed.
The trigger level is expressed as a volume, V[t], and is calculated according to the formula:
V[t] = X + Y,
where:
I = volume of imports
C = volume of domestic consumption
Q[av] = average quantity (volume) of imports during the last three years for which data is available
T[q] = quantitative trigger level expressed as percentage.
Y = absolute volume change in domestic consumption of the product in the year for which the most recent data is available compared to the preceding year, = D C
X= Q[av] x T[q]
There are three trigger levels defined in the Agreement. These are defined where:
T[q1] = 125%, where M < 10%
T[q2] = 110%, where M > 10% and M < 30%
T[q3] = 105%, where M > 30%
Where M = market access opportunities = I/C during the three preceding years for which data is available.
Thus, if M = 20%, the trigger would be activated if the volume of imports (Vt) > Q[av](1.1) + D C
The price trigger level
The reference price for calculating the price trigger level is defined in a footnote to paragraph 1(a) as being in general:
But, it may also be:
There is thus a degree of vagueness in how the trigger price should be established. Countries were not required to include intended trigger prices in their Country Schedules.
The formula for calculating the permitted level of the additional duty is provided in Paragraph 5. The value of this additional duty is dependent upon the degree to which the import price falls below the trigger level. This is outlined in Box 3.3:
Box 3.3: Additional Duty When Price Trigger Level is Exceeded
If (T[p] - P) < T[p] x l0%)
then D[1] = 0
If (T[p] - P) > (T[p] x 10%) and (T[p] - P) < (T[p] x 40%)
then: D[2] = 30% x [(T[p] - P) - (T[p] x 10%)]
If (T[p] - P) > (T[p] x 40%) and (T[p] - P) < (T[p] x 60%)
then: D[3] = 50% x [(T[p] - P) - (T[p] x 40%)] + D[2]
If (T[p] - P) > (T[p] x 60%) and (T[p] - P) < (T[p] x 75%)
then: D[4] = 70% x [(T[p] - P) - (T[p] x 60%)] + D[2] + D[3]
If (T[p] - P) > (T[p] x 75%)
then: D[4] = 90% x [(T[p] - P) - (T[p] x 75%)] + D[2] + D[3] + D[4]
Definitions:
P = current import price (c.i.f expressed in domestic currency)
T[p] = trigger price (average
c.i.f price for 1986-88)
D[ (x)] = additional duty
To a certain extent the mechanism acts in the same way as a variable levy, in that as the import price falls the levy can be increased so as to dampen the price effect on the domestic market. However, it does not completely offset the fall in import prices, ensuring that domestic prices are not entirely insulated from the effects of changing world market prices.
3.2.5 Market access commitments: Implementation issues and policy implications
Having examined in detail the Agreement's provisions regarding market access, we now turn to the question of how these provisions will affect the trade policies of developing countries, and how the new policy constraints may affect their farm protection in the short and longer term.
Converting NTBs to tariff equivalents
The idea behind converting non-tariff barriers to trade into tariff equivalents, suggests that tariffication (as opposed to tariff reduction) should not have any immediate effect upon absolute levels of protection, since the rationale behind tariffication is to convert NTBs into a tariff that provides an equivalent level of protection to that existing by virtue of NTBs.
However, in so far as the levels of protection provided during the base period (1986-88) (for which the tariff equivalents have been calculated) differ from those actually prevailing during the period immediately prior to the start of the implementation period in 1995, tariffication could, in theory, have had an immediate effect upon levels of protection at the beginning of the implementation period.
That is not to say, though, that countries have immediately deployed the maximum permissible tariff at the onset of the implementation period; in many cases the tariff applied (i.e. the actual rate of duty) has remained lower than the base rate of duty.
It is apparent, therefore, that where levels of protection have fallen, or remained the same, since the base period, the process of tariffication need not have had any immediate effect on the level of protection provided to agricultural producers via trade policy.
Extending this notion further, one can also see that the effect of tariff cuts during the implementation period will also depend on how high the base rate of duty is compared with the actual rate of duty. To summarise:
High levels of protection during the base period give rise to high base rates of duty
The conversion of NTBs into their tariff equivalents should, according to the Modalities, have been based upon the difference between the domestic price and world price (border price) during the base period, expressed in domestic currency. The larger the difference is between the two, the greater the protection afforded by the NTBs, and the higher the resulting tariff equivalent.
In fact, the gap between world market prices and domestic prices in many developed countries was in many cases quite high during the 1986-88 base period, in so far as the world-market prices of major agricultural products were on the whole quite low, when compared to longer-run averages and more recent price trends. Additionally, the relatively low value of the dollar during the base period, had the effect of reducing the world price further, when expressed in domestic currency.
'Dirty tariffication'
Another reason why base rates of duty are likely to be quite high relates to what has been called 'dirty tariffication'. This expression describes the situation where countries have deliberately overestimated the levels of protection provided by NTBs in order to increase their operative base rate of duty resulting from tariffication. This has allegedly occurred because the task of converting NTBs into binding tariffs has been left to each individual country concerned. Clearly, countries wishing to retain scope for imposing high levels of protection for particular products, will have found it in their interests to be selective about the data they used for conversion.
In other words the conversion process could have been manipulated in such a way as to lead to a higher base rate of duty, than would be the case had the conversion been conducted in an unbiased fashion. Yet, so long as the results were not challenged during the verification process, which in general they were not, the resulting tariffs became legally binding from the point at which they were submitted to the WTO as part of the Country Schedules.
It should also be noted that if there had been no NTBs and tariffs with water in them (i.e. higher than required to give a certain level of protection), this would have resulted in higher tariffs than by using tariffication. The extent of 'dirty tariffication' is much disputed, and difficult to demonstrate. In any case, given that the contents of the Country Schedules now provide the legal framework for the implementation of the Agreement, the issue is academic.
Some implications of the market access provisions
It is very difficult to provide any firm diagnosis on the likely outcomes of the market access provisions. Much will depend on the manner of implementation. In particular on:
Structural adjustment programmes
As mentioned above, the binding nature of tariffication and tariff reduction depends largely upon the difference between actual rates of duty and base rates of duty. The above paragraphs suggest that base rates of duty are likely to be fairly high due to the choice of the base period, and in some cases because of 'dirty tariffication'.
Equally important, however, is the fact that actual, but usually unbound, tariff rates in some developing countries are in many cases currently lower than base rates of duty, which are bound, as a result of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs), that exist independently of the WTO agreement.
Such SAPs are, in the short term, likely to place a greater constraint upon protectionist policies than are bindings under the WTO. In the longer term, however, tariff reforms under the WTO, are likely to be more influential, in that they are part of a permanent agreement, that will outlive SAPs, and prevent reversion to NTBs and higher levels of protection.
It will, in other words, provide a ceiling beyond which protectionism may not rise. Such a ceiling did not previously exist; moreover, in creating the ceiling, the process of tariffication also introduced the possibility of lowering it, and this is likely to be one of tasks that future WTO negotiating rounds will be concerned with.
Globalised tariff cuts
The effect of the cuts agreed in the Uruguay Round will be reduced, to an extent by the high level of the base rate of duty, and by trade policy reforms that have occurred since the base period. However the manner in which the base rates are to be cut may also act to further reduce the impact.
For example, if a minor commodity is subject to a base rate duty of just 1 percent, a 100 percent cut in the tariff will receive the same weight, as far as global tariff reduction commitments are concerned, as a 100 percent cut in the 200 percent duty on a major commodity.
If, for example, we assume a 100 percent tariff cut for the former, and just a 10 percent cut for the latter, the tariff on the minor commodities will have fallen from 1 percent to zero, whilst the tariff on the major commodity will have fallen from 200 to 180 percent. The average tariff reduction will equal: (100 + 100 + 10 + 10)/4 = 55, which easily meets the global reduction obligations.
In the event, few developing countries took advantages of this possibility in their schedules, in contrast to developed countries, where this reduction minimising effect was more common. As a result, nevertheless, the market access provisions may not have a very great immediate impact on the overall volume of imports, and high levels of protection will have been maintained on some countries most sensitive commodities.
Minimum access
The extent to which minimum access requirements will reduce this protection and encourage new imports is uncertain, and depends largely upon the pre-existing level of imports, and the commitments that have been made in the Country Schedules. At a minimum level of just 3 percent of domestic consumption rising to 5 percent, if the rules were followed closely, the impact of these commitments may not be very substantial. In any case, the minimum access provisions only apply to countries that tariffied, and not many developing countries followed this path.
Conclusion
This section has highlighted the fact that the Agreement and the Modalities both provided countries with some opportunity to avoid offering the sort of tariff concessions that would lead to a major increase in their level of imports. There is certainly evidence to suggest that some developed countries (e.g. EU, USA) have taken advantage of such opportunity:
In addition, the Special Safeguard Provisions provide countries with additional protection against surges in the volume of imports, or a fall in world prices, in the event that bound tariff rates prove insufficient for this purpose.
However, there are difficulties with generalising about the policy implications of market access commitments: the contents of the Country Schedules, that determine these commitments, vary considerably from one country to another, and from product to product.
In the longer term, the tariffication of agricultural trade barriers in the Uruguay Round, could act as a foundation for much deeper cuts in agricultural protection. But, at this point in time the overall effect of the Uruguay Round's market access commitments on the trade and agricultural policies of developing countries would not appear to be very substantial, at least in terms of the protection that they are able to afford to domestic producers.
An additional possible long-term effect of market access commitments might be felt by developing country exporters. Through the reduction the margin between the preferential tariff rates currently enjoyed by some developing country exporters, and the tariffs paid by other countries in developed country export markets.

3.3.5 Domestic support commitments: Implementation issues and policy implications
The importance of the Agreement on Agriculture with regard to domestic policy lies in it being the first time that a close link between domestic and trade policies has been formally recognised. Although the current implications for developing countries may, in most cases, be limited, the future significance lies in the fact that, for the signatories, the Agreement enshrines in international trade law limitations on domestic policy formation, and places constraints on the room for manoeuvre of policy makers. Thus, policies which 'distort' agricultural trade are likely to be increasingly untenable.
At the same time, it is apparent that the agreement is primarily designed to affect domestic policies in developed countries where, in many cases, export subsidies have been used abundantly, and where domestic agricultural policies are frequently geared to the subsidisation of agricultural production. In contrast, in many developing countries the sum total of policy intervention results in the taxation of the sector, particularly of the export producing sub-sector. In contrast to commitments to subsidy reduction, there is no provision in the Agreement which requires countries to reduce the volume of taxation.
3.3.1 Developing country exemptions
As noted above, the domestic support commitments are, in general, far less demanding on the agricultural policies of developing countries, than they are on those of developed countries. This is because:
Two important exemptions from domestic support reduction commitments for developing countries are provided in Article 6 paragraph 2 of the Agreement:
Thus, domestic support meeting these criteria shall not be required to be included in the calculation of the current AMS.
Least-developed countries, on the other hand, are exempt from all domestic support reduction commitments, but may not exceed the Total AMS as established for the base period (1986-88).
The aggregate measure of support (AMS), the indicator used by the GATT/WTO in order to quantify and reduce levels of domestic support, was discussed in Chapter 2. The Agreement, it was noted, commits its signatories to calculate the Total AMS for the base period (1986-1988): the Base Total AMS, and then, in the case of developed countries, to cut this by 20 percent during the 6 year implementation period.
An important consideration in reviewing the implications of AMS reductions is the fact that although most developing countries have no AMS reductions to make, the outcome of a very low or zero base Total AMS means that most developing countries cannot in the future introduce any price distorting support unless the policy falls within one of the specific exemptions.
3.3.2 Exemptions from AMS commitments: 'Green box' policies
Chapter 2 introduced the concept of 'green box' policies; these being policies that are exempted from the AMS calculation by virtue of their being deemed not to have distortionary effects on trade. We will now look in more detail at the 'green box' and the AMS calculation, with reference to the relevant parts of the Agreement's text.
A full account of the 'green box' exemptions to domestic support reduction commitments, is given in Annex 2 of the Agreement. For a policy to be excluded from the calculation of AMS, and hence from reduction commitments, it must be deemed to:
In addition, the domestic support involved through the particular policy must meet the following two criteria:
If all these conditions are met, the policy may be categorised as in the 'green box'.
Policies that may be included within the 'green box' are reviewed below. They are a summary of the list that appears in Annex 2 of the Agreement, to which readers may refer in order to see the exact text of the agreement.
General services
Policies under this heading involve programmes that provide services or benefits to agriculture or the rural community, but which do not involve direct payments to producers or processors. They include:
Public stockholding for food security purposes
This exemption refers to expenditures (or revenues forgone) in relation to the accumulation and holding of stocks of products which form an integral part of a food security programme identified in national legislation. Expenditures may be excluded from AMS calculations provided that the following conditions are met:
Domestic food aid
Policies aimed at providing domestic food aid to vulnerable sections of the community can also be excluded from the AMS calculations provided that:
Direct payments to producers.
Certain types of direct payment to producers may be included in the 'green box' category provided that they 'have no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on production' and provided that the size of such payments, in a given year, is not related to:
The types of direct payment that are permitted are listed below:
Þ De-coupled income support
This implies that for direct payments aimed at supporting the incomes of producers to be exempt from AMS calculations, it is important that they do not influence production decisions i.e., they should be "de-coupled" from production, and should not, therefore, have any effect upon what is produced or on how much is produced.
Þ Government financial participation in income insurance and income safety-net programmes
This exemption is provided on the condition that such insurance only covers income losses in excess of 30% of average gross income and only covers 70% of that loss. Again, these payments should not relate to the volume or type of production, but should be based solely upon income.
Þ Payments for relief from natural disasters
For payments of this kind to be exempt, they must be part of the assistance provided in response to an officially declared natural disaster in which the resulting production losses exceed 30 percent of the average production in the previous 3 years (or 5 years, excluding the years in which the highest and lowest production figures occurred)
Þ Structural adjustment provided through producer retirement programmes
These include payments made to producers as part of a retirement programme in which the producers desist totally and permanently from the production of marketable agricultural commodities.
Þ Structural adjustment through resource retirement programmes or through investment aids
These exemptions include direct payments made under resource retirement programmes, and with respect to investment assistance must be designed to assist the financial or physical restructuring of a producer's operations in response to 'structural disadvantages'. They may also be based on a programme for the re-privatization of agricultural land.
Þ Payments under environmental programmes
This provision is aimed at allowing producers to be compensated for financial losses incurred as a result of clearly defined government environmental and conservation programmes. These include, for example, programmes that require producers to adopt particular production methods or inputs for the purpose of achieving environmental objectives. As such they are exempt from the usual condition that 'AMS exempt' direct payments should not be determined by the type and method of production. The amount of the payment is limited to the extra costs or loss of income resulting from compliance with the government programme.
Þ Payments under regional assistance programmes
Payments in this category are limited to those made to producers in clearly defined 'disadvantaged' regions, in which the disadvantages "arise out of more than temporary circumstances". The region in question must be "a clearly designated contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity".
3.3.3 Other exemptions from AMS calculations
The 'green box' exemptions listed above are probably the best known exemptions from domestic support reduction commitments. While they are of considerable importance to developed country agricultural policy, there are few groups of policies in the 'green box' category which are of major significance in developing countries. Other exemptions include the de minimis and 'blue box' provisions, of which the former is by far the most important.
Þ The 'de minimis' provision
Described in Article 6, this provision offers policy makers additional room for manoeuvre. We discussed previously that where the AMS for a particular product constitutes less than 10 percent (5 percent for developed countries) of the total value of production of that commodity, the de minimis clause exempts that support from inclusion in the calculation of the Total AMS. This exemption also applies to non-product specific support.
Þ The 'blue box' provision
This provision exempts direct payments made in conjunction with production limiting programmes, is of direct relevance to developed countries, (e.g. EU and US set-aside payments), but is of much less concern to developing countries where production limiting programmes are not at all widespread.
3.3.4 Calculating the total AMS
This section provides guidelines on the methodology for calculating AMS values. It summarizes the rules laid out in Annex 3 and Annex 4 of the Agreement. The basic idea behind the AMS calculation is to quantify, in monetary terms, the support provided by all policies that do not fall within any of the exempt categories discussed above. Only when such quantification has taken place, can a measurable reduction take place.
Current versus base period AMS
Verifiable AMS reductions require, firstly, that base period AMS values be calculated and, secondly, that current AMS values be established on an annual basis in order to evaluate compliance with the reduction commitments.
However, the modalities included a provision that allowed countries to gain credit for reforms in domestic support that had taken place during that period (e.g. the EU's CAP reforms). Hence, countries were given the option of using 1986 as the base period. The EU, the USA and Japan all took advantage of this provision, since by raising the level at which their domestic support started, their AMS reduction commitments were made less demanding.
The fixed external reference price
Since the calculation of AMS values entails the quantification of domestic support measures in monetary terms, this raises the question of which prices should be used in order to establish the appropriate monetary values.
The answer provided in the Agreement is that the price adopted should be what is referred to as the fixed external reference price. This is expressed in national currency, and defined as the average price prevailing during the base period.
Box 3.4: Implications of the Fixed Reference Price
The use of a fixed reference price has a number of very important consequences. If we take the example of market price support, the AMS calculation (DS) is based on the difference between the fixed reference price (Pw[f]), calculated for the base year or period, and the administered price (Pd[i]), multiplied by the volume concerned and expressed in local currency, that is:
DS = (Pd[i] - Pw[f]) * Q
During the implementation period, therefore the equation would become:
DS = (Pd[1] - Pw[f]) * Q in year one
DS = (Pd[2] - Pw[f]) * Q in year two
and so on.
Since calculations are expressed in local currency, the only time that an exchange rate is used is in the calculation of the fixed reference price based on the prevailing, and 'appropriate' exchange rate at the time. Similarly, the only reference to world prices in the calculations is in calculating the same fixed reference price (i.e. the appropriate border price). Since the reference price remains, by definition, unchanged, it merely provides a benchmark to compare with domestic prices. This has two consequences:
· Changes in a country's exchange rate has no bearing on the AMS calculations.
· High levels of domestic inflation can create difficulties for countries in meeting their reduction commitments.
As stated in the Agreement, however, countries can ask that account is taken of any difficulties in meeting reduction commitments arising from 'excessive' rates of inflation. However, what 'excessive' means under these circumstances, is open to interpretation, as is the extent to which 'account' is taken of these problems.
Calculating the total AMS
The total AMS is established by summing the value of the product-specific AMS, the non-product specific AMS and the Equivalent Measure of Support. The methodologies for establishing the values of these is presented in the sections below. A Base Total AMS has already been calculated and notified in the Country Schedules. Current Total AMS values are calculated during the implementation period in order to establish compliance with reduction commitments. The following rules apply to AMS calculations:
The product-specific AMS
The Agreement requires that AMS values be calculated on a product-specific basis for each agricultural commodity that receives:
The calculation of the AMS for individual products requires that a value be established for each of these three different types of support. The product-specific AMS is then obtained by summing the three resulting values. The methodology for calculating these three values is presented below. Non-exempt direct payments and measures are those that are not exempted from inclusion within the AMS calculation, by either the 'green box', 'blue box' or de minimis provisions.
Þ Market price support
Market price support is to be calculated by establishing the difference between the fixed external reference price and the applied administered price, and multiplying the resulting figure by the quantity of production eligible to receive the applied administrative price.
Budgetary payments made to maintain this gap, such as buying-in or storage costs, are not included in the AMS. It is worth noting that the market price support component of the AMS applies only to products for which an administered price is actually set. Where a wedge between the market price and the fixed external reference price is maintained by import barriers alone, the market price support element is not included in the AMS calculation.
Þ Non-exempt direct payments - e.g. deficiency payments
Support provided by non-exempt direct payments takes one of two forms for the purpose of calculating AMS values:
The value of this type of support is measured by calculating the difference between the administered price and the fixed external reference price, and then multiplying the resulting figure by the volume of production eligible to receive the administered price. Alternatively the total value of the budgetary outlays involved in this support may be used as the measure of support.
In these cases the total value of budgetary outlays are used as the measure of support.
Other non-exempt measures
These include input subsidies and other measures such as marketing-cost reduction measures.
The value of these measures are established either by using (a) the value of government budgetary outlays, or (b) the difference between the price of the good or service and a representative market price for a similar good or service multiplied by the quantity of the good or service.
In the case where the subsidy is covered entirely by government budgetary outlays, then the former methodology (a) is used. Where this is not the case, for example where government interventions in the market reduce the price of the good or service, the latter methodology (b) is applied. What constitutes "a representative market price for a similar good or service" in (b) is not clearly defined, and probably offers room for manoeuvre.
Non-product specific AMS
Support which is non-product specific shall be totalled into one non-product-specific AMS. It is not possible to calculate levels of market support as in the case of product-specific support. However, non-exempt direct payments, which are non-product specific, and therefore not aimed specifically at maintaining an administered price level, may be calculated on the basis of total budgetary outlays; other non-exempt measures may also be calculated in this manner.
Equivalent measure of support
The equivalent measure of support is to be calculated for all products for which market price support exists, but for which it is impracticable to calculate a market price support component (as described above) for the AMS. For these products market price support is calculated "using the applied administered price and the quantity of production eligible to receive that price or, where this is not practicable, on budgetary outlays used to maintain the producer price." To this value is then added the support provided by non-exempt direct payments and other non-exempt measures, which is calculated in the manner described above.
3.3.5 Domestic support commitments: Implementation issues and policy implications
As was noted previously, the attention paid to domestic support by the Uruguay negotiators came about as a result of the policy excesses in developed countries, and the trade distortions that the high levels of support there have caused.
In developing countries domestic policies have typically taxed producers rather than supporting them, and the value of the Total AMS, in terms of both the base period level and the current level, would be, in many cases negative, if carried to the logical conclusion.
Furthermore, since the product-specific and non-product-specific AMS values, are in such cases, often well below the de minimis levels beyond which AMS reduction commitments start to become effective, many developing countries have found that domestic support commitments have rarely posed a constraint at this point in time.
Nevertheless, there are in developing countries many domestic agricultural policies that should be included in the AMS calculation, particularly in the calculation of product-specific AMS values, even if it is subsequently found that the support they provide falls below de minimis levels, and need not, therefore, be subject to discipline.
At the same time, as most developing countries have zero AMS, the constraint may arise in the future if some price distorting support is introduced, when the zero base AMS will act as a ceiling on such support which is over and above the de minimis level. The following should therefore be noted:
This will not be permitted under the provisions of the domestic support commitments, which, in theory, forbids countries from exceeding base period levels after taking into account the de minimis exemptions, and commits many developing countries (least developed countries excluded) to reducing the Total AMS. This appears to be an anomaly.
Certainly de minimis provisions will exclude subsidies that fall below the value of 10 percent of total production from the AMS calculation, and this means that the Base Total AMS is bound at zero for those countries that implicitly tax their agricultural sectors. Furthermore, so long as future increases in subsidies do not exceed the "de minimis" threshold, then Current AMS will also remain at zero.
This implies that, leaving aside the problem of AMS reduction commitments, developing countries that are at present "taxing" their agricultural sectors will be bound never to raise their support levels above those excluded from the AMS calculation under the "de minimis" provisions.
Before continuing, it is worthwhile noting that AMS measurements differ substantially from a more widely known and commonly used measure of support, the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE). The following Box details the main points of difference. In essence these stem from the fact that the AMS is a much weaker, or less complete measure, and does not take account of a number of some significant forms of domestic support. It also differs in the role played by the external reference price which, as discussed above, makes the measure unaffected by exchange rate and world price movements.
Box 3.5: A Comparison of PSE and AMS Measurements
The most widely used comparable measure of support is the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE). This is often confused with the AMS. The following list is designed to highlight the differences:
The following sections outline some of the policies frequently employed by developing country governments, which may in future, if not at present, be affected by WTO commitments on domestic support.
Output price policies
Government administered output pricing has often been a major feature of developing country agricultural policy. However, unlike in developed countries where administered prices have generally been higher than world market prices, thereby providing support to agricultural producers, administered prices in developing countries have often been lower than international prices and have, therefore, effectively taxed producers. Accordingly, as noted above, the market price support component of the product-specific AMS has, for many agricultural commodities, typically been negative.
Traded input price policies
In an attempt to offset low output prices policy makers have often sought to provide subsidised inputs. These are frequently directed at specific commodities, as part of production packages that include seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machinery, and credit. In such cases the subsidy would be included in the product-specific part of the AMS calculation, although the value of these subsidies often fail to offset the negative value of the market price support component of the AMS. Where input subsidies are not directed at specific commodities they would be included in the non-product-specific component of the AMS. It should be remembered that:
Non-traded input pricing
Subsidies on inputs that are non-traded, such as those on credit, water and electricity are also subject to inclusion within the AMS calculation, although it is not made entirely clear how the value of such subsidies should be calculated.
Marketing interventions
Governments in developing countries are frequently involved in marketing, either through the direct provision of marketing services by state agencies, or through the public funding of various marketing facilities.
Otherwise marketing interventions are excluded from the AMS calculation.
Other public investments
Most other public investments in the agricultural sector of developing countries are exempt from AMS commitments. They gain their exemption either through the specific exemptions accorded to developing countries, or through the 'green box' provisions:
3.4 Export policies: Subsidies and restrictions
3.4.1 Export subsidy commitments
3.4.2 Developing country exemptions
3.4.3 Reduction commitments
3.4.4 Export restraints
3.4.1 Export subsidy commitments
As with domestic support commitments, the commitments on export subsidies have been introduced into the Agreement principally in response to developed country policies. Export subsidies have been a major component of agricultural policies in the EU and the USA, but have not, on the whole, played a very important role in developing countries. Consequently, the Agreement's export subsidy commitments do not, generally speaking, have major policy implications for developing countries. The definition of what constitutes an export subsidy, for the purposes of the Agreement is provided in Article 9. The following list summarises the definitions given in the relevant paragraphs:
· The provision by governments or their agencies of direct subsidies, including payments-in-kind, to a firm, to an industry, to producers of an agricultural product, to a cooperative or other association of such producers, or to a marketing board, contingent on export performance.
· The sale or disposal for export by governments or their agencies of non-commercial stocks of agricultural products at a price lower than the comparable price charged for a like product to buyers in the domestic market.
· Payments on the export of an agricultural product that are financed by virtue of governmental action, whether or not a charge on the public account is involved, including payments that are financed from the proceeds of a levy imposed on the agricultural product concerned, or on an agricultural product from which the exported product is derived.
· The provision of subsidies to reduce the costs of marketing exports of agricultural products (other than widely available export promotions and advisory services) including handling, upgrading and other processing costs, and the costs of international transport and freight.
· Internal transport and freight charges on export shipments, provided or mandated by governments, on terms more favourable than for domestic shipments.
3.4.2 Developing country exemptions
Developing countries receive some temporary and limited exemptions with regards to the export subsidies outlined above. Specifically they are permitted, during the implementation period only, to encourage exports with subsidies aimed at reducing the cost of marketing, processing and transport, provided they are not applied in a manner which would circumvent reduction commitments.
3.4.3 Reduction commitments
For those developing countries that do subsidise exports, the Uruguay Round agreement requires:
Again, as with other aspects of the agreement, the specific implementation rules were often only included in the Modalities, with the result that commitments are only binding to the extent that they appear in the Country Schedules.
3.4.4 Export restraints
Export policies in developing countries have generally concentrated more on export restraints, than on export subsidies. These have taken the form of taxes, quotas and prohibitions.
The Agreement introduces restrictions on the use of export restraints, where such restraints relate to foodstuffs. However, these restrictions do not apply to developing countries unless they are 'net exporters' of the particular foodstuff in question. At the same time, no definitions is offered as to what a 'net exporter' of a particular foodstuff might be in these circumstances. This will have to await clarification by the WTO when such a case arises.
The Agreement disciplines on Export Prohibitions and Restrictions are found in Article 12. For those countries, including developing countries, that are net exporters of a particular foodstuff, the following provisions apply to their use of export restraints:
The Agreement allows for sanctions by other member countries if these two conditions are not adhered to. It does not, however, suggest what these sanctions should be.

WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO has provided an impetus towards greater liberalisation and integration in the world economy. More specifically in the agricultural sector substantial steps have been made towards liberalisation. This Chapter examines the implications of this for developing countries in their capacity as both exporters and importers.
In Part I we saw that the Uruguay Round heralded a process of gradual liberalisation in global agricultural trade. This chapter begins by examining the extent to which the commitments have been fulfilled and the extent to which it has achieved agricultural liberalisation in the short to medium term. Many commentators argue that the most significant liberalisation measures will come from future negotiating rounds. We detail the likely impacts by examining the positive and negative affects for international trade with specific reference to the outlook for commodities of particular interest to developing countries.
THE AIM OF THIS CHAPTER
· To provide you with an understanding of the linkages between the external trading environment and domestic agricultural policy, and the way in which the Agreement will influence the latter.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· The trading opportunities arising from the commitments made by developed and developing countries with respect to market access, export subsidies and domestic support.
· The extent to which the commitments made in the round will have an effect on global agricultural liberalisation.
· The implications of the loss in preferential access for developing country exports into developed country markets.
· The impact of the Agreement on specific agricultural commodities.
· The implications of the new external trading environment on food security.
4.1 Agricultural liberalisation and the commitments of the agreement on agriculture
4.1.1 Market access: Tariffication, tariff cuts and bindings
4.1.2 Domestic support reductions
4.1.3 Export competition
The Punta Del Este Ministerial Declaration stated that there was
"an urgent need to bring more discipline and predictability to world agricultural trade by correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions, including those related to structural surpluses so as to reduce the uncertainty, imbalance, and instability in world agricultural markets."
In this section we will examine the extent to which this might be achieved through the Agreement on Agriculture.
The share of developing countries in world agricultural trade is relatively small (25% of world exports in 1992), but of more importance is their growing share of world imports of agricultural commodities. The commitments undertaken in the Agreement are likely to have a significant impact on this trend, with the most significant impact resulting from the commitments undertaken by developed countries with regard to export subsidy reductions. If implemented in accordance with the letter and spirit of the agreement, the commitments in each of the following three areas should in principle contribute to an expansion of market opportunities at the global level.
· Reductions in domestic support reducing high cost domestic supply, should create one of two effects: a reduction in the supply available for exports, or an increase in import demand.
· The reduction in export subsidies should increase the opportunities on world markets (in terms of volume and/or prices) for non-subsidising exporters.
· Market access commitments in terms of specific tariff quota commitments provide an assured access to markets; the reduction of existing tariffs can provide improved access opportunities; and the tariffication process results in the binding of all agricultural tariffs.
The extent to which these are achieved is highly dependent upon the individual country commitments as submitted in their schedules. We will now examine the extent to which the concrete results as encapsulated in the country schedules satisfy the spirit of the Agreement. The implementation of the three principal areas of the agreement will be examined in turn. The aim is to provide you with an understanding of the extent to which the spirit and basis of agricultural liberalisation in the Agreement has been reflected in the commitments undertaken by both developed and developing countries.
4.1.1 Market access: Tariffication, tariff cuts and bindings
MARKET ACCESS COMMITMENTS
· Base Period: 1986-1988
· Implementation period: 1995-2004
Commitments on access to be implemented in equal annual instalments
Tariffication of Non-Tariff Barriers:
Þ Special Treatment Clause: no Tariffication of NTBs for certain products - valid during the implementation period
Þ Safeguard Provision: for tariffed products only - valid during implementation period
· Ceiling binding for Previously unbound Products
· Reduction of agricultural tariffs: (including those resulting from tariffication) on simple average basis by 24% (with minimum reduction of 10 per cent per tariff line)
· Least Developed Countries are not required to implement reduction commitments
· Minimum access commitments: 3 per cent of domestic consumption in the first year, rising to 5 per cent by end of the implementation period
· Current Access Guarantee: maintenance of current access opportunities (i.e. the quantity of imports in the 1986-1988 period) which exceed the minimum access
The Box above provides a quick review of the commitments undertaken with respect to market access, detailed in chapters 2 and 3, with the focus on the commitments required from developing countries.
The commitments undertaken with respect to market access by developing countries highlight three elements which warrant particular attention.
· First, the process of tariffication shall leave virtually no Non-Tariff Barriers affecting agricultural trade, with clearer transparency for agricultural traders and policy makers. This will be reinforced by the binding of virtually all tariffs. The extent of binding prior to the Uruguay Round are highlighted in Table 4.1. From this we can see that prior to the Agreement 18% of agricultural products were bound by tariffs. This figure is almost 100% with the implementation of the Agreement. Table 4.2 highlights the gains to developing countries through tariff reductions in developed countries.
· Second, the tariffication process has resulted in a number of very high bindings among developing countries. In some cases they represent only minimal cuts. The products affected are similar to those in developed countries i.e. cereals, oilseeds, meat and dairy products but also include some tropical products e.g. coffee, tea and spices. These reflect the "Ceiling Bindings" afforded to Developing Countries which on the whole reflect higher rates than previously applied but unbound MFN rates (not taking into account the effect of NTBs).
· Third, of particular interest are the tariff quota commitments. The highest commitments are provided for cereals, followed by vegetable oils and oilseeds. The countries with commitments in this area are shown in Table 4.3. In many cases tariff quotas have simply been a means of converting voluntary export restraints (VERs), with the quotas being allocated to the same countries. This implies no significant impact initially since exports would enter under the same price structure giving the exporter the same quota rents. The benefits with tariff quotas are that they will not be reduced under the terms of the Agreement, and will provide greater market security for the beneficiary. A final point of note is that many VERs were represented as current access commitments in country schedules.

4.1.2 Domestic support reductions
COMMITMENTS IN DOMESTIC SUPPORT
· Base Period: 1986-1988
· Implementation Period: 1995-2004
· Reduction of Total AMS: Comprising both product-specific and non-product specific AMS by 13.3%.
· 'Green Box' Measures: exempted from inclusion in calculation of total AMS (to be reduced).
· 'Blue Box' Measures - Payments Under production limiting programmes: are exempted from reduction commitment if they are on the basis of fixed area and yields (or number of head for livestock), or on a maximum of 85% of the base level of production.
· De Minimis provision: exempts from reduction commitments AMS which does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of production of a basic product (in the case of product-specific support), or of the value of total agricultural production (in the case of non-product-specific domestic support).
The commitments for domestic support reduction have been detailed in Part I of this manual. The stipulation that it is the aggregate AMS which must be reduced means that there are no commitments to reduce support for individual commodities. This removes from the agenda the politically contentious areas of internal support such as rice in Japan, sugar in the EU and US, and dairy products in most of the OECD countries.
The impact of these reductions in the AMS are more likely to be felt in the longer term following the implementation period
· In future, countries will have to consider ways to assist farmers via policies that are not trade distorting. This will be reinforced by the fact that the effect on domestic support levels is in nominal terms and this will thus be eroded with inflation.
Reductions in support to agricultural producers in both OECD and developing countries are highlighted in Table 4.4.

The countries that have applied non-exempt forms of domestic support were listed in Table 4.3 and highlighted in Table 4.6 above. The developed countries included in the Table are those of export interest to developing countries. The reduction commitment (13.3%) applies to a base period total level of support to agricultural producers e.g. Mexico $9.7 billion and Venezuela $1.3 billion. Thus, by the end of the implementation period the levels of support in these countries will be reduced to $8.4 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.
As in the case of market access there is debate over the extent to which the commitments undertaken represent real reductions. As we have seen the calculation of the base AMS, to which the cuts apply, is based on levels of support between 1986-88, a period characterised by relatively low world market prices for agricultural goods and hence high levels of support to farmers.
· The combination of higher world prices in the current period and domestic reforms undertaken during the Uruguay Round years, means that any reductions in domestic support may have little significant impact in the short to medium term.
· In any case, the reduction commitments are of more significance in developed than in developing countries. The main concern for developing countries will be the avoidance of policies which increase their AMS in the future.
4.1.3 Export competition
EXPORT COMPETITION
· Base Period 1986-88
· Implementation period: 1995-2004
· Reduction of outlays on export subsidies: by 24 per cent of base period level - initial cut of at least 6 per cent in first year of implementation period and thereafter in equal annual instalments.
· Reduction of quantity of subsidised exports: by 14 per cent base period level - initial cut of at least 3.5 per cent in first year of implementation period and thereafter in equal annual instalments.
· Prohibition of export subsidy in the future use where no export subsidies had been used in the base period.
· Exemptions of commitments for developing countries to reduce cost of marketing exports and internal freight subsidies for the implementation period.
· Non-circumvention of commitments: Undertaking not to circumvent export subsidy commitments by means such as tying food aid to commercial exports etc.: internationally agreed discipline to govern export credits, export credit guarantees or insurance programmes are to be developed.
· Unlike the commitments made with regard to market access and domestic support the commitments on export subsidy reductions are most likely to be achieved and probably have the most significant positive impact on developing countries. This is because the subsidisation of domestic over-production onto the world markets was one of the most contentious issues during the negotiations and are thus most likely to be scrutinised by the WTO members.
Table 4.3 indicated the developing countries with export subsidies that are subject to reduction commitments. The products most affected by the export subsidies across developing regions include sugar, rice and vegetables. However, with the exception of Mexico and Colombia, export subsidies amongst developing countries are low or not maintained.
The extent of export subsidy reduction commitments is shown in Table 4.5 while Table 4.6 shows country specific commitments.
During the implementation period the value and quantity of direct export subsidies will be reduced by 36%. This represents a fall from $22.5 billion to $14.5 billion, half of which will be accounted for by the EU. These reductions will have a positive impact for developing exporting countries in traditionally heavily subsidised markets: wheat, beef, coarse grains, dairy products and sugar.
The reduction in the use of export subsidies, although presenting some potential difficulties for net food importing developing countries, should prove beneficial for developing country exporters.

Notes:
1. Commitments converted to US dollars using 1990-91 average exchange rates. Reduction commitments apply to individual product categories as defined in this table.
2. Countries having submitted schedules which do not maintain export subsidies include: Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Cameroon, Chile, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Rep, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Gabon, Grenada. Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Kuwait, Macao, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Surinam, Swaziland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Least-developed countries are exempt from export subsidy reduction commitments.
The gains through the reduction in export subsidies are significant but should be tempered with the knowledge that at current levels subsidised exports will still account for a third or more of the trade in beef, wheat and vegetable oils, while a fifth of poultry and course grains can still be subsidised. There will still be considerable distortions despite the achievements made by the Agreement
4.2 The loss of preferential trading agreements
4.2.1 The general impact
4.2.2 The impact on the least developed countries
4.2.1 The general impact
The commitments made towards the greater liberalisation of world trade and the trade in agricultural products will clearly have an impact on developing countries with regard to the level of preferences they will enjoy.
The rationale behind the granting of preferences was the recognition that developing countries needed concessions to be able to compete, even in traditional markets, with more technologically advanced and competitive suppliers.
· In practice this enabled the recipient to sell products into the preference giving country either at a lower price than non-preference receivers and consequently capture higher sales, or sell at the same market price and receive higher returns because of lower tariffs.
African countries have been the main beneficiaries of preferential arrangements. Table 4.7 shows the level of tariff concessions for a group of sub-Saharan countries which are particularly reliant on provisions. The potential value of preferences given by the EU, Japan and the United States in the agricultural sector in 1992 were estimated at US$ 1.9 billion, with one third going to developing countries in Africa, 40% to Latin America and the Caribbean, and the rest primarily to the Far East and Oceania. The reduction in MFN rates after the UR will lead to a fall in value of preferences by US$ 0.8 billion: 0.2 billion in Africa, 0.3 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean. (FAO 1995)

* Negative sign indicated positive preference
Source: Lal (1994 Table 5) as cited in Harrold (1995).
Table 4.8 indicates how small the level of preferences are now. In many cases, we can observe that the MFN rate is below the GSP. In some cases it has fallen to zero. The focus of the negotiating rounds is the reduction of MFN tariff rates. MFN tariff rates are now low and will become lower at the end of the implementation period of the Agreement: tariffs were 6% on average at the beginning of the Round and will be 4% at the end across all sectors.
· The importance of the MFN rates is that their level determines the size of benefits from a preference: the lower the tariffs the less the preference is worth. For example, most African countries enjoyed duty free access or tariff rates of 0-5% through GSP or Lome Convention Agreements which have been eroded via a loss in their margin of preference and loss in competitiveness.

4.2.2 The impact on the least developed countries
The impact of the loss of preferential margins is likely to be felt most by the least developed countries. 48 countries are identified as least developed of which 39 are in receipt of ACP preferences from the EU. Table 4.9 reflects the particular situation faced by the Least Developed Countries in the Quad markets, i.e. those of EU, USA, Japan and Canada. The table takes into account, on a tariff line basis, the most favourable treatment applicable to LDCs in agricultural markets. It is estimated that the erosion in preferences is most significant in the case of tropical products imported by the EU, where the loss of preferential margins for non-tropical and tropical agricultural products are 29% and 45% respectively. The loss in non-tropical products in the Japanese market is as high as 63%.

The implications of the erosion of preferential margins makes the export impact of the Agreement less clear. The erosion could lead to a fall in export competitiveness and in market share, especially where developing country exporters have been reliant on the preferential price advantage in order to compete in these markets.
· Overall the erosion of preferences is significant. There are likely to be losses of export market share for some least developed countries where the trade creation gains do not overcome the loss in preferential access.
It is the extent of trade creation which is subject to most debate. In the next section we draw on one source of data estimating the impact of the Agreement in this respect. Commentators are divided on the issue but there has been substantial concern expressed regarding the implications for food security. This issue will be considered later.
4.3 The impact of the agreement on agricultural trade liberalisation
4.3.1 Overview of the agricultural trading environment after the UR
4.3.2 The general impact
4.3.3 The regional impact Africa
4.3.4 The impact on agricultural commodities
4.3.1 Overview of the agricultural trading environment after the UR
A range of quantitative studies have been undertaken analysing the implications of the Agreement for international trade. The models have used different assumptions, but have in general overestimated the extent of liberalisation in this respect, and thus overestimated the impact on the net food importers. In this section we will examine the impact of the Agreement on the trade balances of developing countries in general, and on key food commodities of significance for developing countries.
Our discussion on the implementation of the market access commitment emphasised that it is unlikely to result in any significant gains for developing countries. In fact, the overall impact of the Agreement is barely significant. Developing countries as a group are net-food importers: higher world prices will lead to a higher import bill, but higher by $240 million from a total import bill of $18 billion. There will be gains for a few exporting countries in Latin America and for Thailand, as a result of these higher prices, but these will also bring difficulties in import finance for many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This issue is discussed below, and the numbers warrant special attention.
In this section we will draw heavily from the recently published FAO projection to the year 2000. There have been a number of quantitative studies regarding the impact of the Agreement, and the FAO projections represent the most recent.
The FAO model accounted for 59% of the agricultural commodities traded excluding cotton and horticultural products. It takes into account the Uruguay Round changes as well as changes in national policies, and estimates the impact up to the year 2000. The commodities studied include wheat, rice, coarse Grains, oils and fats and oilmeals, sugar, meat, milk and milk products, coffee, cocoa, tea, bananas, hides and skins.
4.3.2 The general impact
The general findings of the FAO study estimated that
· The global value of world trade of the principal agricultural commodities is expected to rise by US$ 55 billion between 1987-89 and 2000, US$ 15 billion of this increase can be attributed to the UR.
· The overall growth in production is projected to decline slightly compared to the 1980's. The impact of the UR on production is negligible.
· The growth rate in global consumption of agricultural commodities is projected to decline. Per caput consumption is likely to decrease for dairy products, grains, beef and coffee, while there will be increases for vegetable oils, some meat, tea, bananas, cocoa and rubber.
· On balance, the Agreement will lead to a small reduction in consumption growth in low income, food deficit countries.
· Developing countries import growth rate will decline for cereals, oilseed, dairy products, and some meat and tropical products. Bovine meat and banana imports are likely to accelerate.
· Export growth is likely to be more rapid than in the 1980's for rice, coarse grains, dairy products, tea, sugar and bananas.
4.3.3 The regional impact Africa
In general, African countries tend to be importers of food, particularly wheat, rice and dairy products. The region consists of over 50 countries of which 28 are classified as least developed and 43 are low income food deficit countries.
Based upon the FAO projections Table 4.10 highlights the impact of the Agreement on commodity imports and exports.

This figure under the UR provisions stands at an estimated US$ 1.7 million. Thus, the net result, for these commodities at least, is a move from a net trade surplus of US$ 1 billion to a deficit of US$ 1.5 million without the Agreement. In the context of the Agreement, this deficit rises to an estimated US$ 1.7 million. These changes imply that emphasis needs to be given in African countries to:
One method to facilitate this may be the passing on to the producers changes in the international price of cereals. We will explore and detail some of the domestic policy responses in the next chapter.
Latin America and the Caribbean
The region as a whole prior to the UR was a net importer of cereals although several countries in the region are net exporters, e.g. Argentina and Uruguay. One country in the region is classified as least developed and 9 are low income food-deficit countries.
Table 4.11 highlights the trade gains and losses for developing countries in Latin America with, and without, the Agreement.

The Far East
The Developing Countries in the Far East are overall net exporters of rice, fats and oils and tropical products, and net importers of other cereal and milk products.

The projected trade balance is highlighted in table 4.15.

The Near East
The Far East is predominately a net importer of agricultural products. Only two countries in the region are classified as Least Developed and only a minority of the countries of the region are members of the WTO. Thus, their agricultural policies will not be subject to the commitments of the agreement, but nevertheless they will be affected by them. The region earns little from agricultural products and the bulk of these were outside the commodities analysed. Table 4.13 details the gains and losses and the trade gap is forecast to widen from US$ 11 to US$ 19 billion by the year 2000.

4.3.4 The impact on agricultural commodities
The impact of the Agreement is primarily likely to affect international trade in temperate products. These form the main focus of the Agreement, and it is likely that there will be a reduction in world output of these commodities as production in some major developed countries falls.
In this section we detail the effects on the world prices and trade in specific agricultural commodities. The implications are likely to be strongest in those products where protection among OECD countries was substantial, namely cereals (in particular, wheat, rice and coarse grains), meat, dairy products and sugar.
It is expected that the effects of the Agreement will:
These effects on world market supply and demand will tend to push up the world market price for the products concerned. We will now examine the specific impact of the UR on the commodities analysed in the FAO study. We will review them under the same criteria, namely the impact of the Agreement on production, consumption, price and trade.
WHEAT
Overall Impact
A modest impact is made by the Agreement in terms of changes in the volume of trade. There is a distinct shift in production and trade flows to less subsidising net importers primarily in developing countries. The big gainers are Argentina, China, Pakistan and India. The impact of these changes will be largely determined by the degree of price transmission to domestic markets through tariffs, because of the flexibility accorded to governments with higher ceiling bindings than current tariff rates.
Impact on Production
· Production is expected to increase by 1.6% per annum during the 1990's, equivalent to 631 million tonnes by 2000. This growth is expected to be slower than the rate which would have occurred without the Agreement.
· Shift in production location with an overall decline in production of 2 million tonnes. This is broken down to a 7 million tonne reduction in developed countries and an increase of 5 million tonnes in developing countries.
· 80% of the increase in wheat production arising from the Agreement will be accounted for by Argentina, China, India and Pakistan.
Impact on Consumption
· Consumption growth rates are expected to be below those recorded in the 1980's.
· Without the Agreement the market would be characterised by falling real prices. With the Agreement there will be rising real prices.
· Shrinkage in consumption as a result of higher domestic price increases relative to other commodities. Income growth is not expected to be significant to offset higher prices.
· Feed consumption falling in developing countries and rising in developed countries.
Impact on International Price
· Increase by 7% in real terms by 2000 (3% without the Agreement). This will be a result of falling subsidies.
· Average domestic price will be highest in Latin America followed by the Far East. There will be little change in the Near East and Africa.
Impact on Trade
· Slow growth compared to the 1980's.
· Lower volume of wheat imports.
· Asia and Latin America are grown to meet their own requirements.
· Increases in consumption in EU, Poland and South Africa.
· Fall in subsidised exports from 59 million to 40 million tonnes: 3/4 accounted for by EU, Canada and US.
· As a result of the price increase the value of trade in wheat rises to US$ 700 million.
· The lower volume of imports to developing countries is expected to be offset by higher prices.
RICE
Overall Impact
The Agreement could have a significant impact on the value of the world rice trade. This will only be possible if minimum access commitments are fulfilled with Japan, Thailand, Korea and Indonesia purchasing their stipulated volumes: the international rice market will not be significantly affected by tariff reductions. However, the potential boost to the rice trade is expected to be the most important source of foreign exchange earnings for developing countries. The impact on production and demand is insignificant. In the case of the former this is because no major changes in domestic support to rice resulted from the Agreement
Impact on Production
· Estimated global output growth at 1.8% per annum reaching 404 million tonnes by 2000 - marginally better than baseline projections.
· Opening of Japanese market is expected to stimulate exporting countries to raise production from Japanese access commitments.
· Moderate changes in production regionally. Marginal rises in Far East Countries with EU production showing a significantly smaller increase.
Impact on Consumption
· Rate of growth similar to projection without the Agreement.
· Growth in demand is expected to increase to 1.8% per annum reaching 402 million tonnes by 2000.
Impact on Price
· International rice prices boosted with stronger import demand relative to export supplies.
· Real term increase of 15% over the base period compared with 7% on the baseline predictions.
Impact on Trade
· Impact more pronounced than in the case of production and consumption with respect to the volume of transactions and international market prices, assuming full implementation of minimum access provisions.
· World rice imports rise by 3.8% annually to 18.9 million tonnes, an increase of 6.8 million tonnes.
· Impact in world imports localised. Insignificant impact in Africa, Near East, Latin America and Caribbean.
· Significant impact in the Far East. Imports rise to 3.9 million tonnes, at faster rates than without the Agreement. This reverses the decline of the 1980s.
· Structural changes with Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, China and Myanmar becoming key exporters. Thailand will maintain its dominance in rice exports.
· Increase in international rice prices and volume of trade boost value of global rice trade by 15% above the without Agreement scenario. A figure which represents an increase of 80% from 1988.
COARSE GRAINS
Overall Impact
The effects on the coarse grain trade in terms of shifts in production location, direction of trade flows and the share in trade volumes are not as significant as for wheat. This is due to the lower levels of domestic subsidy for coarse grains compared to wheat. The reduction in subsidies is likely to increase competition and international prices. As with wheat a significant share of imports is not covered by the agreement.
Impact on Production
· Baseline trend shows an increase of 1.71% per annum to 971 million tonnes.
· Bulk of increase is in Maize production followed by Sorghum and other grains.
· Slight impact with the Agreement over the baseline trend. Output higher by 3 million tonnes.
· Increase in production in developing countries but due to factors outside the Agreement.
· 75% of the increase is in Developed countries. Most in North America (7 million tonnes). Oceania and South Africa (1 million tonnes). A loss of 5 million tonnes in Western Europe.
· Far East Production contracts by 3 million tonnes compared to the situation without the Agreement.
· Increased production in Latin America, particularly in Argentina and Brazil, will offset the loss in the Far East.
· SSA output gain of 800000 tonnes shared widely,
Impact on Consumption
· Baseline growth of 1.3% per annum to reach 968 million tonnes by 2000.
· 140 million tonnes forecast for developing countries.
· 75% of the total increase is for feed use: feed use pattern shift from developed to developing countries.
· Impact of the Agreement not significant: 2 million ton expected expansion is almost entirely in developed countries as feed.
Impact on Price
· Moderate Increase in the international process of maize and millet/sorghum while other coarse grain prices rise by 7%.
· Domestic maize prices increase among major producers in Africa, Latin America and North America and fall in Europe and Par East.
· Average Sorghum/millet prices higher in Africa and Latin America but lower in North America.
· Decline in Barley prices in EU, higher for North America and Far East.
Impact on Trade
· Expansion of the coarse grain trade by 1% annually in comparison to almost no growth in the 1980's. Global trade total of 122 million tonnes. The Agreement is expected to cause only a modest expansion.
· Maize is expected to form the bulk of the increase in trade.
· Strong rise in imports among developing countries,
· 27 million tonnes accounting for almost all trade growth. The Agreement is expected to favour the increase in imports; coarse grain imports expand by 2 million tonnes, 2/3 among developed countries.
· Most significant impact is increase in trade flows in Western Europe by 2 million tonnes.
· Overall impact in developing countries is increased production coupled with no change in demand, leading to a reduction in imports in all developing regions except the Far East.
· 3 million tonnes increase in Far East for feed mainly in China followed by Indonesia and Brazil.
· The increase in the value of trade is expected to be higher than that for wheat, and the burden of import costs more equitably distributed amongst developing and developed countries. Africa could experience a net decline in expenditures on coarse grain imports.
· Subsidy reductions provide gains for Argentina, United States and Australia.
4.4 The impact on food security
The preceding section highlighted that the losers from the Agreement are likely to be the Net Food Importing Countries. This adverse impact was expected to be a short to medium term phenomenon.
Developing countries will be affected both as importers and exporters. The impact on the latter was discussed briefly with respect to the erosion of preferential access agreements.
· Developing countries are generally net importers of the agricultural products most affected by the Agreement.
A rise in international prices for major food items such as cereals, dairy products, meats, edible oils and sugar is likely.
· As a result it is expected that the food import bill will rise for several developing countries.
· The impact on the food bill will be accompanied by the loss in export market access as a result of the erosion in preferences discussed earlier.
In light of the likely negative effects of the changes in the external agricultural trading system, there was a special arrangement in the Final Act to provide some amelioration. The Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on least-Developed and Net Food Importing Countries attempts to deal with the issues relating to food security that arise from the Agreement. As implied, the decision was taken to offset higher world food prices caused by agricultural trade liberalisation, a factor reinforced by the fact that export subsidy reductions will, in some cases, raise the effective price paid by importers.
We will examine the details and implementation issues that arise from the Decision in Chapter 7 when we examine the implications for national policy response to deal with food security after the Agreement.

WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
This chapter focuses on the policy responses and implications that stem from the Agreement on Agriculture. The focus is upon the manner and extent to which policy design is constrained, or otherwise influenced, by the commitments undertaken in the Agreement. Central to this is the influence the Agreement will have on production policy in developing countries and government concerns to promote both internal food security and external market opportunities via agricultural exports.
For most developing countries, the implications of the commitments undertaken in the Agreement need to be examined within the framework of policy initiatives currently taking place. The trend in recent years has been towards market-oriented economic reforms and unilateral trade liberalisation. In Africa, in particular, these reform packages have been introduced under the guise of structural adjustment programmes with emphasis on internal and domestic liberalisation. Clearly there is an intuitive rationale in assuming that the two, internal reforms and external liberalisation commitments, are compatible.
It is difficult to make broad generalisations as each developing country is faced with particular constraints and objectives in the formation of macro-economic and agricultural policies. However, in this Chapter we seek to elucidate some of the broad trends in policy formation in developing countries, and investigate the implications the Agreement will have on internal policies with respect to compliance with both the Agreement and reform programmes.
THE AIMS OF THIS CHAPTER
· To highlight the implications of the Agreement for Agricultural Policy in Developing Countries.
· To examine the implications of the Agreement in the context of policy constraints presented by domestic reform programmes.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· About domestic policy considerations in the light of both the Agreement and structural adjustment/economic reform programmes.
· An understanding of both internal and external opportunities and constraints in agricultural policy design.
5.1 The policy environment
5.1.1 Domestic policy and the agreement commitments
5.1.2 Economic reform programmes and the structural adjustment framework
5.1.1 Domestic policy and the agreement commitments
The economy-wide impact of reforms to domestic policy is likely to be insignificant in the short term, because of the combination of 'green box' policies available and the special and differential conditions
As we showed in chapters 2 and 3, the 'green box' policies in conjunction with the special and different treatment given to developing countries provides a degree of flexibility for developing countries with regard to policy design. Recall that the essence of the 'green box' measures is that they must be Government funded and entail neither transfers from consumers to producer (particularly those via manipulation of the price structure) nor direct price support. The basic aim of the exemptions is to avoid distortions that encourage overproduction and hence distort comparative advantage.
Conditions attached in the 'Green Box' include:
Under the Special and Differential conditions accorded to developing countries the following types of support are exempt
5.1.2 Economic reform programmes and the structural adjustment framework
Since the mid-eighties many developing countries have embarked upon economic reform programmes that have aimed at internal and external liberalisation. These market oriented reforms have been high on the agenda of developing countries prior to the completion of the Uruguay Round of Negotiations. It is true to say that these countries have maintained, and in some cases speeded up, the pace of economic liberalisation during the Uruguay Round Negotiations, notably the countries of Latin America and south-east Asia.
The trend towards greater liberalisation in domestic policies has been due to both internal and external forces. In the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa many countries are undergoing Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) which have involved substantial liberalisation measures accompanied by fiscal and monetary austerity and devaluation. Whilst in Latin America and South Asia structural adjustment loans have been accompanied by similar economic reforms initiated by governments in conjunction with a move towards greater openness in multilateral trade. Thus, the trade liberalisation resulting from the Uruguay Round can be seen to complement the implementation of these reform programmes.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, since the 1980's, the policy environment has been characterised by constraints and disciplines imposed by a structural adjustment framework which has been externally driven. Loans from the World Bank and the IMF are made conditional on the implementation of substantive economic reform programmes. Countries undergoing these programmes and in receipt of these loan packages are highlighted in table 5.1.
The stabilisation component of SAPs usually involves the devaluation of the national currency (the overvaluation of exchange rate has been a common underlying cause of non-competitiveness and domestic price distortions) in relation to the major traded currencies, and government expenditure reductions. The aim is to transfer resources from the production of non-tradable to tradable goods. Thus, the greater openness encouraged via the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations reinforce this trend.
Economic reforms have encouraged a movement of policy initiatives away from taxing agriculture to supporting it as the source of economic growth and foreign exchange earnings. This places great emphasis on agricultural commodity producers who have experienced a dual effect of reforms, namely higher producer returns and higher costs of imported inputs. The pressure to increase production is reinforced by both rising populations and high food import bills stemming from the devaluation.
The need for policy support in the short to medium term provides the rationale behind the concessions in the special and differential treatment provided in the Agreement. The issue is the provision of support in the face of fiscal constraints imposed by the structural adjustment programme itself. As a consequence, appropriate targeting of policy is crucial since expenditures need to be directed towards
We examine the policies to achieve this in the next section, while also looking at the extent to which the commitments undertaken in the Agreement place constraints on them.

5.2.2 AMS issues
5.2.3 The de minimis implications

5.2.1 The domestic policy options
In this section we will examine the impact the Agreement will have on some of the policy instruments currently used in developing countries and whether they comply with the disciplines it imposes. Box 5.1 highlights the total support allowed to agricultural producers compliant with the Agreement.
Box 5.1 Total Support to the Agricultural Sector after the Agreement
Total Support
= Production/Trade Distorting Support (i.e. as encapsulated by the AMS)
+ de minimis Support
+ Special and Differential Treatment Support
+ Production Limiting Support
+ 'Green Box' Support
Source: Konandreas and Greenfield, 1996.
In relation to the commitments/constraints imposed some special points should be noted or reiterated:
5.2.2 AMS issues
The agreement that the current total AMS must not exceed the base total AMS which, where positive, must be reduced by 13.3% over 10 years by developing countries. It might appear that this does not provide developing countries with too severe a commitment. However, there are problems which may arise as a result of a zero or low base AMS.
This point can be illustrated, if we consider the commitment undertaken concerning government purchases for food security purposes.
In certain cases, this problem can be overcome through use of the de minimis clause which would allow procurement at administered prices.
5.2.3 The de minimis implications
As explained above, the de minimis provision is extremely important in view of the lack of flexibility which may be implied by the AMS provisions. The 10% de minimis commitment for developing countries means that as long as price support is less than 10% of the value of production, then the policy will comply with the agreement.
The importance of this is sizeable if one considers that price support is given to the value of marketed output rather than total value. As suggested in Chapter 3, the lower contribution of marketed production in relation to total production creates the situation where the lower the marketed share of output the higher the price support that can be provided. Thus, if marketed output is 25%, then the 10% de minimis could be equivalent to a 40% price support on marketed output.
5.2.4 The implications for specific policy instruments
Table 5.2 provides an overview of the implications for specific policy instruments in the context of the Agreement and domestic reform programmes as embodied by economic reform programmes. We examine the implications for each instrument outlined in Table 5.2 in more detail below:

Good

Results may be too long term, particularly infrastructure. Extension benefits arguable, investment in marketing and storage most beneficial. Difficult to target
· Output Prices: Commodity specific mechanisms using some form of administered price to support producer prices.
This has been the most common form of government intervention and protection used in the agricultural sector in developing countries. Domestic intervention to influence output prices involves the commitment of scarce public resources and/or further protection of domestic production via tariffs or, prior to the Agreement, other restrictions on imports.
The manipulation of the price system is a blunt instrument in that it is unable to target its impact and fulfil its objective of raising or ensuring an adequate income on an equitable basis. It is also likely to be regressive in its nature since the producers will benefit according to the quantity of produce marketed.
Greater effectiveness can be achieved if intervention stabilises domestic prices at the border price, using the range determined by the import and export parity prices. Provided that a long enough time period is used and account of the limitations of import-export parity prices is made, such a policy may not distort prices unduly.
· Traded input prices: Actions influencing the prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, machinery etc. Typical forms of intervention are subsidies for chemical inputs and fertilisers, either on a sectoral basis, or targeted towards particular groups of farmers or commodities. The distribution of these inputs has usually involved public sector activity since private sector efforts usually mean remote areas not receiving access because of poor rural infrastructure.
The advantages of input over output price support include:
In relation to the Agreement, when they are targeted towards the poor they are exempt. Thus, input commodity intervention may substitute for output price intervention. But the critical issue for Policy-makers is how to target the subsidies effectively to those most in need.
There are some disadvantages:
Overall, like output price intervention, input price intervention can have a regressive impact as the better off farmers are usually the ones to benefit most in the absence of effective targeting.
· Non-Traded input prices: primarily credit subsidies; also implicit subsidies/taxes on water electricity etc. Such subsidies are generally compliant with the Agreement, since it are not considered to be trade distorting.
Interest rate subsidies, have certain advantages: they are less difficult to target and less likely to lead to inefficient resource allocation or price distortions. As such, they promote efficient use of resources and are compatible with both structural adjustment programmes and the Agreement. Moreover, credit subsidies need not directly affect commodity prices or quantities.
· Marketing Interventions: activities which influence the functions of marketing intermediaries and the financing of marketing costs. Marketing subsidies are often considered as a concomitant of output price manipulation. Typically, the marketing subsidies have been linked to commodity price policy in so far as the supported price or price range cannot be maintained without public subsidy of the marketing agency or parastatal. Support to import substitutes contribute directly to the AMS and would therefore be influenced by the 10% de minimis commitment in the Agreement.
However, this is not the case for exports where subsides to reduce the marketing costs and to reduce domestic and international transport costs are exempt from contributing to the AMS.
· Non-price Measures: direct ('decoupled') income payments; income insurance; restructuring grants. In general, these are policies more commonly used and applicable in developed countries where the problem is 'over' and not 'under' production.
Other 'green box' measures, include public investment in the form of extension services, infrastructural development or the provision of marketing and storage services.
Þ Such public expenditures have been squeezed at a time when they are most needed in order to support agricultural development, as a result of the fiscal austerity imposed via structural adjustment programmes. In addition, agricultural development requires the provision of services which the dismantling of state enterprises has impeded.
Thus, there are specific agricultural production policies that can reinforce macroeconomic and trade policy reforms, but careful consideration needs to be given with respect to the setting of the levels of intervention. The following extract highlights the policy issues faced by developing countries in the context of internal and external policy influences:
Domestic market reform involves sending appropriate price signals to producers as to what goods are needed and wanted by consumers (both home and abroad) and allowing producers access to productive inputs and capital for investment. This usually means relaxing government restrictions, in particular those that keep prices down, and often involves more private sector (competitive marketing). It may also require the development of suitable policies to target assistance to the poor (both as producers and consumers). In addition, stabilisation programmes can usefully protect domestic industries from the vagaries of short term world market price fluctuations. Such stabilisation policies should not, however, mask the longer term trend of prices on world markets.
FAO 1993a, page 40.
5.2.5 Consumption policy options
The provision of affordable food is a key component of the food security policies pursued by developing countries. The implications of the Agreement for consumption support programmes, either via general food subsidies or ones targeted towards the poorest groups in society, is an important issue.
The relevant provision in the Agreement is under 'food aid' in the 'Green Box'. In general, the basis for food assistance is based on nutritional criteria. The additional and more relevant provision for developing countries allows for subsidised food prices that aim to provide the poorest sections in urban and rural areas with food at reasonable prices.
· the real constraints on government food security programmes will come not from any constraints imposed by the Agreement but rather budgetary constraints that may come from economic reform programmes which cause cuts in consumer support programmes.
Food security issues are addressed by the Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food Importing Countries. The essence of this decision allows for increased food aid and other measures of support which will allow the effects of any consumer price increases to be dampened while allowing producer prices to rise for farmers. The issues surrounding this Decision are addressed in greater detail in Chapter 7.
5.2.6 Domestic market stability
In the previous chapter we argued that there would be likely price changes as a result of the liberalisation process initiated by the Agreement commitments. The important issue for the domestic policy concern how to absorb any external shocks resulting from greater openness to the international domestic agricultural markets.
Four likely trends or impacts on market stability can be highlighted which will require policy responses and changes. These are:
In response, policy responses could be devised to dampen the impact of such market instability. These are listed:
· The use of Special Safeguards is provided for in the Agreement for countries that opted for it. If you recall from Part I, the special safeguards allow for imposition of additional tariffs whenever prices fall significantly below the Agreement base period of 1986-88 or when import volumes surge. The problem for developing countries is that not many reserved this right as it was only allowed for products subject to tariffication.
· Countries may adopt a sliding scale of tariffs that is inversely related to the level of import prices. This is particularly practical for developing countries who bound tariffs at a high level in order to provide the opportunity for such flexibility. As long as the different levels adopted in the sliding scale are no higher than the rate bound in the Schedule, the action is WTO compliant. To achieve this a price band policy may be used whereby tariffs change only when import prices move outside the band between floor and ceiling prices. As long as the price band is not too narrow, the world price signal is not entirely lost so domestic prices would still move in line with world prices.
However, there is a question of WTO legality with such a policy. The issue is whether the price band mechanism is seen as a "ordinary customs duty" (WTO Legal) or whether it is argued that it is a "variable import duty" (WTO illegal and subject to dispute procedures). To sum, only a formal dispute settlement proceeding can settle this issue. But it is unlikely that a dispute would arise as long as the policy is predictably and transparently implemented.
· A third policy to ensure greater market stability would be to ensure supply stability through the provision of food security measures. As we have seen this is allowed for in the Agreement.
· Article 12 of the Agreement allows a country to place limits on exports provided that the food security of the importing country is taken into account.
· The use of instruments that mitigate the effects of price uncertainty whilst allowing price variability to remain the same. These instruments, such as the use of futures contracts, are WTO compatible.
5.3 Trade policy reform before and after the UR
5.3.1 The trade policy environment in developing countries
5.3.1 The trade policy environment in developing countries
As we have seen from the discussion above, economic policy reform programmes have been underway to some degree, for some time in developing countries. Agricultural trade policy reform is an integral part of the success of these programmes. As such, the market access provisions in the Agreement should reinforce the implementation of such reforms. Trade policy reform is likely to support agricultural development via:
From our understanding of the Agreement, we can see that the first two of these factors are addressed explicitly in the Agreement. The latter two will arise from trade policy reforms that support the wider economic reform programme. In this section we examine the trade policy trends in developing countries which existed prior to the Uruguay Round and examine how the Agreement commitments affect the direction of trade policy.
We will now consider border policies with respect to agricultural commodities and examine the influence of the Agreement on these trends i.e. whether they have reinforced, stunted or reversed the liberalisation.
As we have argued, the pattern of agricultural policy in developing countries was tax agriculture. Domestic markets were often highly protected by import controls. The years preceding the Uruguay Round negotiations saw trade policy reforms in developing countries centred on the removal of quotas or licensing restrictions, and changes in the tariff structure. Export promotion policies included:
This emphasis on export promotion began a process of moving away from the taxation of agriculture, and the associated disincentive effects on production and consequently export of agricultural commodities.
The implications of the commitments to the Agreement will vary according to the precise nature of the trade policy instruments employed by each country. The matrix presented provides some guidance on the compliance of different trade policy instruments with the Agreement and with the domestic policy reforms usually undertaken in developing countries.
5.4 Policy options under saps and commitments in the agreement: A framework for analysis
The following matrix encapsulates some of the issues we have been discussing so far. The aim is to provide you with a quick overview of the twin compliance stemming from SAPs and the Agreement.
The matrix highlights where policies are neutral with respect to the Agreement and where there may be policy pressures and constraints presented by domestic policy reform as encapsulated by SAP programmes. It also highlights the efficiency and equity issues associated with each policy.
It would be a useful exercise for you to compile a similar matrix to the one shown by looking at the policy instruments currently applied to the agricultural sector, and on specific agricultural commodities in your own country. This will enable you to bring many of the issues discussed in this Chapter and other Chapters in the manual into a more familiar and relevant context.
Table 5.3 A Summary of the Compliance Issues for the Domestic Policy-Maker
DOMESTIC POLICY ENVIRONMENT
COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE
COMPLIANCE WITH STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMMES
EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Domestic Agricultural Policies
1. Output Prices
Commodity Specific mechanisms using some form of administered price to support producer prices.
· Use of Minimum Guaranteed Prices for Products such as wheat, rice or sugar?
Both types of support will influence the AMS, although the de minimis ruling may exempt commodities with a low degree of positive protection.
In general, support in developing countries is negative in aggregate. The AMS may become positive with the removal of implicit Taxation.
However, such support may still be exempt because the de minimis ruling is based upon 10% of the total value of production and this may be larger in the case of marketed production. Increasing the possibility of exemption of positive support to key commodities.
SAPs emphasise the elimination of producer subsidies or taxes.
If current levels of support are negative such policies do not comply.
Implementation of SAP provisions should lead to removal of the gap between domestic and adjusted border prices and increasing returns to producers.
Minimum price guarantees can provide a degree of price stabilisation which may increase efficiency.
However, reducing market risk via general output price intervention may result in an inefficient allocation of resources.
Minimum price guarantees are generally regressive in their impact, favouring those who market the most, or those able to produce commodities for which support is most positive.
2. Traded Input Prices
Actions influencing the prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, machinery etc.
· Is there use of Input subsidies? e.g. on fertilisers, seeds etc.
NB in most countries this policy tool is being gradually phased out.
Input Subsidies generally available to poor farmers are exempt from inclusion in the AMS.
Input subsidy elimination is an important part of SAP conditions. Current policies in line with this therefore comply.
Such support is potentially more cost effective to administer than output price support, and it can be used to promote technical innovation, but is a blunt instrument in that it frequently by-passes the poorest farmers who may not use these inputs. May be easier to forgo than output price support.
3. Non-Traded Input Prices
Primarily credit subsidies; also implicit subsidies, taxes on water, electricity etc.
· How prevalent is this kind of subsidy?
· Is there substantial government expenditure on implicit subsidies for areas such as irrigation water, credit, electricity etc.?
Input Subsidies generally available to poor farmers are exempt from inclusion in the AMS.
There is pressure from SAPs to eliminate implicit subsidies as well as general interest rate subsidies since they are not compatible with the spirit of SAPs.
Credit subsidies, being input neutral compared with traded inputs, provide a relatively efficient form of support with substantial scope for targeting towards the poorest. However, water and electricity subsidies and other similar support may lead to excessive and inefficient use.
4. Marketing Interventions
Interventions which influence the functions of marketing intermediaries and the financing of marketing costs.
· What agricultural commodities are marketed, at least partly, by public sector agencies?
Only those subsidies which 'distort' prices of inputs or outputs are the concern of the Agreement. Therefore, it is neutral with regard to any subsidies which merely facilitate public sector marketing.
Marketing subsidies which affect input or output prices are included in the AMS and considered above.
Subsidies which reduce export marketing costs are exempt.
De-regulation and privatisation of public sector enterprises are a significant feature of SAPs.
Public sector marketing is often regarded as highly inefficient, although frequently this is due to a failure to account separately for commercial and social functions. The latter can be important to areas disadvantaged by poorly developed physical and market infrastructures.
5. Non-Price Measures
Direct ('decoupled') income payments; income insurance; restructuring grants.
· Are these measures currently being operated?
· This is not a common policy instrument in developing countries.
Although most 'Green Box' policies are not currently applicable, there may be scope in the future especially with regard to payments under environmental programmes.
SAP conditionality rarely makes reference to this type of policy measure, except in so far as high levels of government expenditure are discouraged.
At the same time, environmental considerations are increasingly favoured.
In so as decoupled non-price support does not directly affect resource allocation it can be an efficient mechanism of intervention.
Direct income transfers may also be potentially easy to target.
At the same time, administrative costs may render such interventions prohibitively expensive in developing countries.
B. TRADE POLICY INSTRUMENTS
1. Export Policies
Taxes, Subsidies, and export prohibitions.
· Are Export Duties used?
· Are Export Subsidies used?
· Are there Export Prohibitions?
Export taxes do not run counter to the Agreement. However, prohibitions do, except for health or social reasons, and will hence be hard to justify.
Transport and Marketing subsidies on exports of developing countries are exempt. For example, a freight subsidy for cut flowers would be exempt.
Export taxes and subsidies, in so far as they distort domestic resource allocation, are frowned upon, although the promotion of export earning activities are encouraged.
Export taxes are a relatively inefficient way of raising government revenue since they act as a disincentive to export production.
However, windfall taxes following world price escalation may be justifiable on equity grounds, and is in the interests of economic stability.
Export Subsidies may be efficient in the short term (but only in the short term) to foster market access or, in the small country case, to dispose of atypical surpluses.
2. Import Policies
Tariffs, quotas, other non-tariff barriers, import prohibitions.
· Are Import Subsidies used?
· Are there Import Tariffs?
· Are there Import Prohibitions?
· What are the tariff commitments undertaken in the country schedule?
· Is there a ceiling binding and gradual reduction commitments?
Do current tariffs fall into the range of commitments undertaken, in the schedules. To what extent has greater transparency been achieved?
SAP conditionality encourages reduction of tariff barriers and tariffication of non-tariff barriers, although limited use of tariffs is acceptable at a common rate.
Import subsidies provide disincentives to domestic producers and are discouraged.
Tariffs are more efficient than other forms of import restriction, although any intervention which increases the import price of food is likely to disadvantage the poorest, particularly the urban poor.
Import subsidies are highly inefficient, since the subsidy benefits foreign suppliers directly, although the distributional effect, likely to be ambiguous, may benefit consumers, many of whom are poor, at the expense of producers, many of whom are also poor.
C. PUBLIC INVESTMENTS
Investment in research and extension; provision of physical or marketing infrastructures
· How sizeable is the expenditure on agricultural research and extension?
· What is the percentage of this expenditure in total agricultural subsidies?
Expenditure on research and extension is exempt from AMS considerations, i.e. falls into the 'green box' category, as does investment in physical or marketing infrastructures.
Investments that aim to facilitate economic and physical infrastructure development are encouraged, where they are within spending constraints, especially if they aim to overcome market imperfections while leaving resource allocation to market forces.
This type of investment is regarded as efficient since it facilitates private sector development, and does not directly affect prices.
At the same time, public investments are typically long term, and the poor have relatively short time horizon. Such investments are particularly hard to target.
D. FOOD SECURITY MEASURES
Consumer price subsidies; food stock maintenance; food aid provision.
· What consumer subsidies are in operation?
· For example, are products/commodities such as wheat, edible oils and sugar affected by consumer subsidies?
The Agreement is neutral with regard to consumer subsidies, so these do not affect compliance.
Neither do the maintenance of food reserves (which are not used to support producer prices) or the provision of foodstuffs at subsidised prices.
SAPs generally require the curtailment of public spending, particularly on consumer subsidies.
Conditionality is likely to require the reduction or elimination of consumer subsidies.
General food subsidies are highly inefficient since the poor and non-poor may benefit equally. Such leakages are reduced through targeting, but the associated administration costs are likely to be high.
5.5 Concluding comments
The structural adjustment reforms undertaken have encouraged greater reliance on private sector activities as well as fiscal and monetary austerity. Increased competition to foreign competition has been often a key feature. The tariffication process and the other commitments of the Agreement have, on the whole, reinforced this process. It is argued that the gains for developing countries from incorporating agriculture under the trade rules of the WTO, will come in the long run via more secure markets and more stable agricultural commodity prices in particular for food commodities.
The impact of the Uruguay Round Agreement on any country will primarily depend upon its domestic economic environment in conjunction with changes in external prices or markets. The central task faced by Policy-makers is to ensure the transmission of any benefits of the Agreement to domestic producers and consumers, as this will determine the extent to which higher and more stable prices, improved transparency, and greater market access are translated into improved incentives to domestic producers and investors. Thus, agricultural trade reforms combined with macroeconomic reforms which enhance the efficient use of scarce natural, human and financial resources are critical in ensuring the maximisation of the opportunities created by the Agreement.

6.3 Policy responses in addressing food security
Checklist box for chapter 6
WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
The coming decades will pose increasingly complex issues for national policy makers in developing countries, with food security being paramount among these. The previous chapters have drawn attention to the importance of the food security issue in the wake of the external trading changes that are likely to arise from the Agreement. A common theme in Chapters 4 and 5 was that the impact of the Agreement was going to be most significant for consumers and subsequent consumption policies in net food-importing countries.
In this chapter, we focus specifically on the food security issue. Food security in some countries may be adversely affected and could present formidable challenges for policy makers. The response is likely to encompass further structural changes to these economies in addition to support from the international community.
THE AIMS OF THIS CHAPTER
· To focus our attention upon the food security implications arising from the Agreement.
· To examine the provisions in the Agreement that address food security issues.
· To develop an understanding that there are other factors, and not just the Agreement, that will affect food security.
· To draw attention to some of the policy implications that will arise in addressing food security in the new external trading environment.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· How food Security was addressed in the Agreement.
· The issues that surround the Agreement's provisions for food security.
· The policy responses for food security that arise from the agreement.
6.1 The agreement and food security
The Agreement indirectly addresses food security issues via the Special and Differential measures and, as we have seen throughout the Manual, these are an integral part of the Agreement for developing countries. It allows developing countries more time and smaller reductions in the areas of market access, domestic policies and export subsidies. In addition the de minimis commitment is raised to 10% and there are further exemptions related to input subsidies and export marketing. These were discussed at length in chapters 2 and 3.
The Marrakech Ministerial Meeting foresaw, and acknowledged, these likely negative effects and that the Special and Differential treatment in the Agreement for developing and Least Developed Countries would need to be supplemented with special measures. The important measures adopted at the Marrakech Meeting were:
· The Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food importing Countries.
· The Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries.
The Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme sets out measures in recognition of the difficulties which may be faced by the Least Developed and net-food importing developing countries during the implementation of the Agreement.
The Decision addresses the issue of food security by:
· Augmenting the provision of food aid by:
· Promises for full consideration of requests for financial and technical assistance to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure.
· 'Appropriate provision' for differential terms with respect to export credits.
· Short term assistance in financing normal imports from international financial institutions under existing facilities, or those established in the context of adjustment programmes.
These measures have two principal objectives:
However, in meeting these objectives the Decisions fall short in providing concrete measures with regard to implementation. The following points have been made with respect to the Decisions:
Implementation of the Decisions has yet to address:
The Committee on Agriculture will estimate the cost of the negative effects of reforms, and subsequently make recommendations for additional aid. However, the WTO does not have aid funds to directly support such assistance.
6.2 Assessing the implications of the agreement on food security
6.2.1 Influencing the foreign exchange earning capacity
6.2.2 Influencing the price of food imports and market stability
6.2.3 Influencing the availability of food assistance
We have seen that the projections carried out by FAO to the year 2000 forecast a substantial rise in world agricultural trade. However, despite the gains in trade and the ability of the worlds productive capacity to meet effective global demand for food, there will be considerable regional variations, with certain areas receiving no improvement in food security.
Estimates to the year 2020 by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimate that there will be very little reduction in the number of malnourished children in the developing world as a whole. Whilst in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the number of malnourished children may actually increase. (Rosegrant 1995)
Food security is defined by FAO to have three dimensions: food supply; access to food; and stability of flows over time. The changes in the external policy environment will influence national food security in three ways.
6.2.1 Influencing the foreign exchange earning capacity
In chapter 4 we saw that the potential foreign exchange earnings could be increased as a result of the improvements in market access, although the effect could be limited in the short to medium term, unless there is an effective supply response. More importantly, as we have discussed in Part II, the response in production will depend upon the overall policy environment in particular developing countries.
Equally important is the focus of the Agreement upon the temperate products of developed countries. Price increases are concentrated on these products. For example, there are likely to be increases in cereal prices: developing countries have a 10% share of cereal exports, alongside a 40% share of world imports. Thus, there is a likely negative impact. The loss in preferential margins will also have a negative effect on foreign exchange earnings in Latin America and Africa.
Overall, the ability of developing countries to make adequate gains via export earnings to meet the increase in food import bills may be limited. Developing countries as a whole are expected to improve their trade balances by some US$ 7.5 billion between the base period and 2000, of which US$ 3.1 billion can be attributed to the Agreement. However, these gains are unlikely to be shared equally: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per caput food availability is low, the rise in the import bill is unlikely to be offset by gains in other sectors.
6.2.2 Influencing the price of food imports and market stability
The increased project prices in the FAO forecasts point towards an increase in the food import bill. The domestic policy reforms in developed countries will see the reduction in production for major agricultural food commodities, although this reduction in production and consequent upward pressure on food prices will be spread over a number of years during the implementation.
The impact on the food import bill is highlighted in table 7.1. It shows that between 5 and 20% of increases in the food import bill to the year 2000 can be attributed to the Agreement. In the Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries the import bill is projected to rise by US$ 10 billion, of which 14% can be attributed to the impact of the Agreement on world market prices.
6.2.3 Influencing the availability of food assistance
The Decision compensates for the increased food import bill by accommodating the need for greater food aid. The Agreement is unlikely to affect the provision of food aid directly. However, the reduction in export subsidies and other price support in developed countries is likely to reduce the level of cereal stocks which were in many cases used to fulfil food aid requirements.

Influences will also come from events other than the Agreement. Two critical influences are reform programmes currently taking place in the CAP of the EU; and the transition of formerly centrally planned economies. A successful transition of the latter is likely to mitigate some food price increases as increased supplies arrive on the market.
IFPRI projections to 2020 looked at food projections in the context of different investment and trade scenarios, and therefore included the implications of the Agreement on Agriculture. The global projections of supply and demand of food highlight that the world is at risk of maintaining a two-tiered system of food security, with rich and rapidly growing countries enjoying abundant, affordable food supplies and poor countries suffering from malnutrition and food insecurity. It is argued that national governments need to devise policy responses that address this imbalance through their agricultural and social investment decisions. This would greatly improve food security and reduce malnutrition in developing countries
6.3 Policy responses in addressing food security
A number of policy responses could be devised in conjunction with compensatory, and food aid, support from the international agencies. IFPRI has predicted that the aggregate global supply and demand for food is relatively good if governments and the international community direct policy commitments towards agricultural growth, via cost effective investment in agricultural research, extension, irrigation and water development, human capital and rural infrastructure. These represent the key elements in any policy strategy towards addressing food security in the long run.
We highlight below some more specific polices which policy makers may wish to consider. Some of the policies have been discussed in the context of the preceding chapters but we will highlight them again here.
· There is a need to maintain the transmission of higher price incentives to producers whilst providing support to consumers during the adjustment process. This was the aim of the Decision in the Agreement: to meet short term needs for assistance so that net food importing countries will not have their consumption policies compromised by the liberalisation effects of the Agreement.
· The changes in the terms of trade between cash and food crops may move in favour of the latter: the extent to which a production shift occurs depends on the extent to which prices are transmitted to local producers. Governments may also need, in the short term, to target subsidies to vulnerable consumers.
· The promotion of regional integration and harmonisation of cereal policies, which in the medium term could lead to new sources of supply and greater market development.
· Greater regional co-ordination in addressing food security needs is important and was highlighted in Chapter 6. A collective strategy particularly in Africa would reduce the overall costs of maintaining adequate food reserves, and take advantage of the large common borders between the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where illegal cross border trade is prevalent.
· Additional food aid, which requires the Decisions of the Uruguay Round transformed into concrete measures.

Checklist for chapter 7
WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT
The gradual progress towards multilateral trade liberalisation through successive GATT negotiations has been accompanied by the parallel proliferation of Regional Trading Agreements (RTAs). GATT 1947 accounted for the likely development of RTAs via Article XXIV on the principle that they are not necessarily incompatible with the liberalisation goals underpinning the GATT. However, political as well as economic goals drive RTAs and the post war pattern of interventionism and discrimination towards third countries has shown that the two can be contradictory goals.
One of the tasks of this chapter is to bring to light some of the issues that have now emerged in the context of RTA's, in the light of stronger disciplines in agricultural trade. We will investigate the implications for existing agreements and whether the Agreement provides a new impetus for greater regional policy coherence in agriculture. The question we will be addressing is: what are the linkages/conflicts between the Agreement and RTAs?
Central to the issues raised in this chapter is consideration of the economic and political motivations prior to the Agreement and how they may change with the economic changes created. RTAs have had to comply with provisions primarily set out in Article XXIV in GATT 1945. We will spend time developing a clear understanding of these as they remain binding under the WTO which has reinforced the provision with the Uruguay Round Understanding on Article XXIV.
AIMS OF THIS CHAPTER
· To examine how Regional Trading Agreements are affected by the Uruguay Round Agreement.
· To show how RTAs comply with provisions established by GATT 1947 and 1994.
· To develop an understanding of how the Agreement on Agriculture creates both opportunities and constraints for existing and new agreements.
· To show how RTAs present an opportunity for developing countries to strengthen their gains from the Uruguay Round and future rounds of negotiations.
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
· The background of RTA's in the context of the GATT.
· The regulations of GATT and the WTO governing RTAs.
· Policy measures that support RTAs whilst complying with the spirit of Agreement commitments.
7.1 Regional trading agreements (RTAS)
7.1.1 The rationale for RTAS
7.1.2 RTAS and agricultural trade
7.1.1 The rationale for RTAS
The development of internationally integrated production structures has led to pressure for broader and more stable international markets, which, in the context of the breakdown of old political alliances, has led to an acceleration in the process of regional integration. The trend towards regionalisation is by investment rather than trade, including investment in the service sector, although the process also is being fuelled by a parallel trend towards trade liberalisation (FAO 1993).
The development of Regional Trading blocs via Customs Unions or Free Trade Areas (FTAs) has occurred throughout the world, and includes both developed and developing countries. But in many cases progress towards the economic vision that stimulated their proliferation has been mixed. To date, the most significant by far has been the European Union (EU). The impact of this regional grouping has had a significant impact on world agricultural markets, and provides a benchmark for comparative analysis when judging the coverage of other agreements.
There are a number of motivations for RTAs that relate to political as well as economic forces. A RTA can be defined broadly as a process of reducing the economic significance of national political boundaries within a geographic area.
The following extract points towards the interlinkages between economic and political forces which drive Regional Trading Agreements, and their complementary with the GATT;
"...a key motivation of excluded countries to join an existing RTA or form a new one is their desire to safeguard their ability to pursue outward-oriented development policies, (and this) suggests that RTAs can make a positive contribution to the liberalisation of global trade"
Blackhurst and Anderson 1989.
· It is apparent, therefore, that regional agreements are potentially policy options that are compatible with the multilateral liberalisation objectives of the GATT, and represent a potential stepping stone towards unilateral liberalisation.
The debate over the contribution of such agreements to the liberalisation of world trade and hence the implicit compatibility with the GATT is divided. It is clear that in the context of lowering trade barriers between countries RTAs can be compatible.
In recent years, policy makers from developing countries have reinforced their commitment to regional trading agreements. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 highlight the existing agreements between developing countries and the growth of intra-regional trade respectively. By the end of 1994, 98 agreements had been ratified by GATT, a further 11 were notified under the enabling clause of 1979. Interestingly, 34 agreements were notified in the period 1990-94. This was stimulated by the following factors
· The growth of bilateral trade agreements most notably in the trade relations of the United States and the new European Union. This, combined with the drawn out negotiations and the fear that there would be no final agreement, led countries to strengthen regional blocs in anticipation of a future polarisation of trade.
· The growing harmonisation in agricultural policies of many countries either through internally stimulated reforms cultivating greater openness, or externally imposed reforms as part of structural adjustment programmes.

7.1.2 RTAS and agricultural trade
We have seen that RTAs are not new, and that there have been a number of efforts made by developing countries. However, the treatment of agricultural commodities has not been similar to agreements which have governed trade liberalisation in other sectors. ECOWAS is somewhat an exception where agriculture is fully integrated into the RTA in principle. But the stumbling block encountered in this agreement, as in others, has been the integration of agricultural policy. The differences between the members trade policy reforms and domestic policies hindered the incorporation of agricultural policy into a coherent regional framework.
The impact of the Agreement is likely to have a significant impact on the possibility of this situation changing in the future.
· In general, the loss of preferential trading agreements, discussed in Chapter 4, will stimulate the growth of regional groupings via the strengthening of existing agreements.
· The process of unilateral trade liberalisation embarked upon by many countries, as discussed throughout Chapter 5, also indicates that agricultural policies in many developing countries are becoming closer.
· The commitments in the Uruguay Round with respect to domestic support to agriculture is now removing the conflict countries face between trade aspirations and domestic policy constraints. Although, as we have seen in Chapter 6 the opportunities of this are countered by the potential for non-conformity via dirty tariffication and the flexibility accorded to developing countries.
7.2 RTA's and GATT regulations
7.2.1 The MFN principle and RTAs
7.2.2 Article XXIV of GATT 1947
7.2.3 The Uruguay round understanding on RTAs
This section examines more closely the compatibility and the requirements RTAs need to fulfil in order to comply with the GATT articles which were drawn up in 1947. The following section examines how these have been modified
7.2.1 The MFN principle and RTAs
· The MFN principle is embodied in Article I of the GATT and commits signatory governments, now members of the WTO, to the principle of non-discrimination stating that members "shall unconditionally offer to all other contracting parties (members) any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity affecting customs duties, charges, rules and procedures that they give to products originating in or destined for any other country".
· The essence of the MFN is potentially contradictory to some of the practices which subsequently have been adopted in RTAs. The MFN clause is designed to ensure that the multilateral trading system operated on the principles of comparative rather than political advantage. Thus, a country is expected to import from the lowest cost foreign supplier ensuring world markets reflect comparative advantage whilst simultaneously minimising the costs of protection. To sum up, the MFN aims to ensure the depoliticisation of world trade.
· Customs unions and Free Trade Agreements are allowed under GATT provisions with conditions which are discussed below. The rationale behind this lies in the reasoning that such agreements are formulated on the basis of reducing trade discrimination and therefore have an economic rationale that is, in theory, compatible with the principles underlying the GATT.
7.2.2 Article XXIV of GATT 1947
Box 7.1 highlights the provisions in GATT that apply directly to RTAs. The key provision is in Article XXVI which applies to RTAs directly. It permits the formation and existence of Customs Unions and Free Trade Areas on the principle that although it affects the principle of non-discrimination, the agreements in themselves present opportunities for further economic integration. Thus, the purpose of a customs union or a free trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other contracting parties with such territories (Article XXIV, par. 4).
Paragraph 8 states that such RTAs must eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations affecting substantially all the trade between their constituent territories. This phrase "substantially all" has been open to many different interpretations. Importantly, the requirement to remove duties and other restrictions on mutual trade is not binding. There is flexibility with respect to the "substantially all" clause and also with respect to the fact that "where necessary" members will be allowed to maintain their right to impose duties and trade restrictions of various kinds.
Thus, the substantially all provision is seen as a way of avoiding the inclusion of particular sectors in such agreements. Historically this has been the agricultural sector where domestic policies and objectives differed considerably between members, and proved too sensitive to reform.
Box 7.1: GATT Provisions on Regional Integration Agreements
Article XXIV: This Article is the principal one dealing with customs unions and free trade areas. It provides a number of rules governing such agreements, including notification and review by the contracting parties acting jointly. Agreements most meet the "substantially-all-trade" requirement, and members of a regional integration agreement must have a trade policy with respect to third; countries that is not on the whole higher or more restrictive than the individual policies prior to the agreement.
Grandfathering: Certain previously existing preferential trade arrangements were exempted from;
MFN requirement at the time of GATT's inception, including British Imperial Preferences, preferences granted by the Benelux customs union and the French Union (Article 1:2). However, these preferences were capped and their significance reduced in the course of multilateral tariff-cutting exercises. If agreed by the Contracting Parties acting jointly, pre-existing regional: integration agreements may be so exempted (grandfathered) at the request of new members at the time of their accession (for example, the customs union between Switzerland and Liechtenstein is provided for in Switzerland's GATT accession protocol).
Part IV on "Trade and Development": provides for special measures intended to promote the trade and development of developing contracting parties. Prior to the 1979 Enabling Clause Part IV was invoked by developing-country participants with respect to preferential trade arrangements which did not meet the substantially-all-trade requirement of Article XXIV.
In some instances, parties involved with developing countries have invoked Part IV in Article XXIV working parties to justify preferential, non-reciprocal access for developing country members (for example, the European Community in the context of the First, Second and Third Lome Conventions). Views among contracting parties differ regarding the merits of linking Article XXIV with Part IV.
The Enabling Clause, includes a legal cover for preferential trade agreements between developing countries, subject to certain conditions, including transparency. Among contracting parties, views differ as to whether the Enabling Clause covers regional integration agreements (customs unions and free trade areas) for which provision is also made in Article XXIV.
Article XXV: The contracting parties acting jointly have occasionally granted waivers for sectoral free trade agreements (for example, the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and the 1965 Canada-United States Auto Pact). In one early instance, a waiver was obtained by France for its proposed customs union with Italy not then a GATT member,
Source: GATT and Regionalism.
In the case of customs unions the same duties and regulations must be applied to all non-members, i.e. the application of a common external tariff and more commonly a common trade policy
The rationale was to highlight the potentially high political costs of the formation of customs unions. A wider sectoral coverage of the agreement enabled the enhancement of the trade creation impact of such agreements. But this aim of imposing a high cost has been reduced through interpretation and the enabling clause.
7.2.3 The Uruguay round understanding on RTAs
The Uruguay Round sought to remove some of the ambiguities and enforce more rigorous monitoring of RTAs in the future. Thus, an Understanding on the interpretation of Article XXIV was added, which together with the original provision in GATT 1947 would become the responsibility of the WTO. Box 7.2 details the Understanding.
Box 7.2 The Uruguay Round Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV of GATT 1994
The Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV of GATT 1994 recognises, inter alia, that the contribution of free trade areas and customs unions to the expansion of world trade is increased if the elimination between the constituent territories of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce extends to all trade, and diminished if any major sector of trade is excluded. Further, it is reaffirmed that the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other members with such territories, and that in their formation or enlargement the parties to them should, to the greatest possible extent, avoid creating adverse effects on the trade of other members.
This Understanding introduces for the first time an examination of the economic impact of regional agreements. As in other areas of the Uruguay Round, Jinks between multilateral obligations and measurable economic criteria have been established.
The most important provisions are:
i) the evaluation under Article XXIV: 5(a) of the general incidence of the duties and regulations of commerce applicable before and after a formation of a customs union shall be based upon an overall assessment of weighted average tariff rates and of customs duties collected;
ii) the "reasonable length, of time" referred to in Article XXIV: 5© should exceed 10 years only in exceptional cases;
iii) tariff negotiations under Article XXIV: 6 and Article XXVIII concerning increases of bound rates, involving a member forming a customs union have to start before tariff concessions under the customs union enter into force. These negotiations will take place with a view to achieving I mutually satisfactory compensation from me customs union through reductions of duties on the same or other tariff lines.
The Understanding imposes no obligations to provide compensatory adjustment to the constituents of a customs union. Notification procedures under Article XXIV: 7(a) as well as periodical reporting as provided for in GATT 1947 are reaffirmed. The provisions of Articles XXII and XXIII of GATT 1994 as elaborated and applied by the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes may be invoked with respect to any matters arising from the application of those provisions of Article XXIV relating to customs unions, free trade areas or interim agreements leading to the formation of a customs union or free trade area.

7.3 Policies that support RTAS and the agreement commitments
In this section we examine the policy implications that stem from the Agreement and the extent to which they can support regional development. We will draw upon the policy options that were described in Chapter 5 but also some of the resulting trends highlighted in Chapter 4. In highlighting the policy response for RTAs we reveal that the trend in the future will be that a conducive trade policy and domestic policy environment are established by the Agreement.
RTAs are likely to be strengthened in the agricultural sector via the following policies:
· A common border policy which supports tariffs rather than non-tariff barriers. These on the whole have occurred where countries have entered into RTAs. This has now been reinforced to a degree at the multilateral level by the Agreement commitments on market access.
· Quasi tariffs which may take the form of variable levies are also appropriate in developing a common regional pattern of border protection. This is allowed for in the Agreement although indirectly. In the previous two chapters we have seen that the high ceiling bindings adopted by many developing countries on key agricultural food commodities can facilitate such variable duties, since the ceilings are set substantially above currently applied rates.
· Harmonisation of import policies and the greater co-ordination of export marketing. This is likely to be facilitated by export opportunities created by the Agreement as well as the erosion of preferential access. This provides an opportunity for developing countries with similar export products and markets, to co-ordinate their export marketing and harmonise import policies.
· Regional food security. Many countries in Africa and in other developing regions have food security high on the national policy agenda. We have seen from chapter 4 that the prices of agricultural food commodities are likely to rise as a result of the Agreement. The importance of strategies of collective self-reliance in dampening the effects of these rises, and reducing the cost of maintaining adequate food supplies may be crucial. Efforts towards lowering barriers to intra-regional cereal trade may facilitate this. The effect of the high ceiling bindings allow the scope for variable tariffs and other discriminatory concessions to a degree, although these may not be sustainable in the long run.
Thus, the trade policy reforms facilitated by the Agreement may serve to strengthen the basis for RTAs. As we have highlighted, there is also a food security objective which could be satisfied with closer regional co-ordination in agricultural policy.
7.4 Concluding comments
The conflict between RTAs and the GATT principles in the past is likely to be reduced as a consequence of the successful conclusion of the UR and the establishment of an Agreement on Agriculture. The guiding principles of regional agreements in the past were primarily based upon trade policy concessions. This avoided any real harmonisation of domestic policies and the difficulties in the agricultural sector as a result of national sensitivities precluded its role in such agreements. The success of RTAs and benefits towards agricultural development will come from greater co-ordination, not only of border measures but also of domestic policies.
The commitments undertaken in the Agreement will provide the basis from which greater coherence could develop with respect to both trade policy via tariffication and tariff reduction, and domestic policy. The previous chapters have shown that developing countries, in light of their commitment, may still be some way from this although the opportunity was provided by the Agreement.
The strengthening of RTAs may be an important policy option in the context of greater liberalisation of agricultural trade, and may strengthen agricultural and economic development as well as facilitate greater coherence for future rounds of multilateral trade discussions. The effect which the Agreement has on this process is likely to be significant in the long run. In addition the greater co-ordination between countries, particularly those in Africa where the institutional framework is in place, may provide a vital opportunity to address food security.
Checklist for chapter 7
After reading through this chapter you should be able to make notes on the following issues:
<section>d</section>
Annex 1 - The world trade organisation and agriculture
Introduction
The establishment of the World Trade Organisation was not foreseen when talks began in the Uruguay Round in 1986, but as the talks progressed it was put forward as the necessary institutional framework to ensure the implementation of the final agreements. As emphasised throughout this Manual, the agreements reached at the end of the Uruguay Round represented a formidable step forward in efforts to improve the regulation of international trade.
· In short, the WTO provides the common institutional framework for the conduct of trade relations among its members in matters related to the agreements contained in the Final Act.
Chapter 1 outlined the historical background to the Uruguay Round of negotiations and the issues which were central to the Round. In this Annex, we will examine the agreement that established the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The Establishment of the World Trade Organisation
At the Marrakech Ministerial Meeting on 15 April 1994 the final act embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations was signed by all GATT contracting parties. A total of 111 countries out of 125 formal participants in the Uruguay Round signed the Final Act. By mid 1996 the organisation had 116 members, with 37 countries having observer status. The list of current members and observers are presented in the Box A1 at the end of this annex.
The WTO provides the common institutional framework for the conduct of trade relations among its members in matters related to the agreements in the final act of the Uruguay Round. The key features and functions of the organisation are highlighted below.
The key features of the WTO
The functions of the WTO
The Decision Making Structure and Procedures Under the WTO
The WTO is headed by a Ministerial Conference meeting at least every two years, with a General Council meeting when appropriate. The Ministerial Conference is composed of representatives of all WTO members, and can take decisions on all matters under any of the multilateral trade agreements.
The General Council administers the day to day work of the WTO. It is also comprised of all WTO members, and is required to report to the Ministerial Conference. As well as conducting work on behalf of the Ministerial Conference the General Council convenes as the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) and the Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB).
The General Council delegates responsibility to three other major bodies: namely the Councils for Trade in Goods, Trade in Services and TRIPS. The Council for Goods oversees the implementation and functioning of all the agreements covering trade in goods though many such agreements have their own specific overseeing bodies. There is, for example, a Committee for Agriculture.
Three other bodies are established by the Ministerial Conference and report to the General Council. The Committee on Trade and Development is concerned with issues relating to the developing countries and, especially, to the Least Developed nations. The Committee on Balance of Payments is responsible for consultations between WTO members which undertake trade restrictive in order to cope with Balance of Payments difficulties. Finally, issues relating to WTO's financing and budget are dealt with by a Committee on Budget.
· The WTO will continue the GATT practice of decision making by consensus. A consensus decision is defined as when no member, present at the meeting when the decision was taken, formally objected to the proposed decision. Voting will decide the issue if no decision by consensus is possible with different procedures for the particular issue under consideration.
Each member of the WTO has a single vote at meetings of the Ministerial Conference and the General Council, except that the European Union will have a number of votes equal to its member countries who are WTO members. But the number of votes in no case can exceed the number of member states.
The organisational structure of the WTO is shown in Figure 1.
Figure A-1. The Organisational Structure of the WTO
The Settlement of Disputes Under The WTO
It is widely accepted that dispute settlement procedures have been strengthened by the Uruguay Round Negotiations. There is now a unified dispute settlement process covering the three areas of goods, service and investment. This is reinforced by the groundbreaking Agreement on Agriculture.
Some of the improvements include:
However, some of the criticisms of the new dispute settlement procedures include:
In general, it is widely expected that smaller countries will now be able to bring disputes to panels and have them settled more effectively. However, the positive changes could be countered with the establishment of an appellate body which could mean that panel decisions are likely to be appealed against, so that governments can demonstrate their concerns with respect to affected domestic industries.
Overall, the significance of the WTO can be placed into a clearer perspective if we consider the counterfactual. Without the WTO the changes and disciplines established by the Uruguay Round would nevertheless have been incorporated into the previously provisional nature of the GATT framework.
· The establishment of the WTO undoubtedly creates a degree of permanence in the enforcement of the GATT framework. There is now an established institutional framework to enforce and administer the GATT agreements including, most significantly, the mandate to impose cross retaliation.
This illustrates the clearest change since the WTO, unlike the previous process, enforces all the various agreements and decisions under the GATT.
The Main Features of Dispute Settlement
· Where a dispute is not settled through consultations the Dispute Settlement Unit (DSU) requires the establishment of a panel, at the latest at the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) following that at which a request is made, unless the DSB decides by consensus against establishment. The DSU also set out specific rules and deadlines for deciding the terms of reference and composition of panels. Where the parties do not agree on the composition of the panel (normally three persons), this can be decided by the Director-General.
· A panel will normally complete its work within six months or, in cases of urgency within three months. Within 60 days of the issuance of the panel's report, it will be adopted, unless the DSB decides by consensus not to adopt the report or one of the parties notifies the DSB of its intention to appeal.
· In the event of an appeal, an Appellate Body will be established, composed of seven members, three of whom will serve on any one case. An appeal will be limited to issues of law covered in the panel report and legal interpretations developed by the panel. Appellate proceedings shall not exceed 60 days from the date a party formally notifies its decision to appeal. The resulting report shall be adopted by the DSB and unconditionally accepted by the parties within 30 days following its issuance to Members, unless the DSB decides by consensus against its adoption.
· Once the panel report or the Appellate Body report is adopted, the party concerned will have to notify its intentions with respect to implementation of adopted recommendations. If it is impracticable to comply immediately, the party concerned shall be given a reasonable period of time, the latter to be decided either by agreement of the parties and approval by the DSB within 45 days of adoption of the report or through arbitration within 90 days of adoption.
· Further provisions set out rules for compensation or the suspension of concessions in the event of non-implementation. Within a specified time-frame, parties can enter into negotiations to agree on mutually acceptable compensation. Where this has not been agreed, a party to the dispute may request authorisation of the DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations to the other party concerned. The DSB will grant such authorisation within 30 days of the expiry of the agreed time-frame for implementation.
· Disagreements over the proposed level of suspension may be referred to arbitration. In principle, concessions should be suspended in the same sector as that in issue in the panel case. If this is not practicable or effective, the suspension can be made in a different sector of the same agreement. In turn, if this is not effective or practicable and if the circumstances are serious enough, the suspension of concessions, may be made under another agreement.
The Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM)
The regular monitoring of national trade policies of the WTO's members is an important part of the work of the TPRB under the General Council. The objectives of the TPRM are via regular monitoring:
Reviews are undertaken on a regular basis. The four largest trading members; the EU, the United States, Japan and Canada, are examined every two years. The next 16 countries in terms of their share of world trade are reviewed every four years; and the remaining countries every six years, with the possibility of a longer interim period for developing countries.
As we stated earlier, the reviews are undertaken by the TPRB, established at the same level as the General Council, on the basis of two documents: a policy statement by the government under review, and a detailed report prepared independently by the WTO secretariat. These two reports, together with the proceeding of the TPRB are published after the review meeting.
The TPRB will also carry out an annual overview of the developments in the international trading environment which are having an impact on the multilateral trading system, assisted by an annual report by the Director-General setting out major activities of the WTO and highlighting significant policy issues affecting the trading system.
· In addition to TPRM, many other WTO agreements contain obligations for member governments to notify the WTO of new or modified trade measures. For example, details of any new anti-dumping or countervailing legislation, new technical standards affecting trade need to be notified to the appropriate bodies in the WTO.
It is also important to note that the Agreement on Agriculture involves annual reporting to the Committee on Agriculture, with details of any changes in the use and levels of tariffs, NTBs, export subsidies and domestic support arrangements, including updated AMS calculations.
Membership and Accession
Membership to the WTO can be in the form of an individual country or a customs territory having full autonomy in the conduct of its trade policies. Thus, the European Union is a member of the WTO. This is of particular significance in the voting and decision making process. Although decisions are taken on the basis of one member one vote, it is possible that regional groups (who have a number of votes equal to the number of members) will use their voting strength to disproportionate effect.
A key issue is the accession of non-members. The entry requirements for new members requires the acceptance of all the Agreements of the Uruguay Round. In practice, this will mean that new members are likely to have to accept stricter requirements than existing and founding members of the WTO. The implications of this were foreseen by many countries and this explained the high number of new GATT members during the course of the Uruguay Round negotiations.
The accession process
In the first stage of the accession procedures the applicant government is required to provide the WTO with a memorandum covering all aspects of its trade and economic policies having relevance to the WTO agreements. This becomes the basis for a detailed examination in a working party.
Alongside the working party examination, the applicant government engages in bilateral negotiations with interested WTO member governments to establish its concessions and commitments on goods and services. This bilateral process, among other things, determines the specific benefits for WTO members in approving the accession. Once both the examination of the applicants trade regime and market access negotiations are complete, basic terms of accession are drawn up by the working party.
The final stage sees the results of the working party contained in a report, a draft protocol of accession, and the agreed schedules resulting from the bilateral negotiations are presented to the General Council or the Ministerial Conference for adoption. Successful accession requires a two-thirds majority vote in favour by WTO members. The applicant may then sign the protocol and accede to the Organisation; when necessary, after ratification in its national parliament or legislature.
The Significance of the WTO
In this annex we have tried to describe the regulatory framework of the GATT which is now embodied in the agreement establishing the WTO. The aim has been to give an understanding of the role of the WTO, and the extent to which it might ensure a non-discriminatory multilateral trading system.
The importance of the WTO lies in its consolidation of all the Agreements and arrangements of the GATT, both 1947 and 1994, under a single umbrella. Thus, there is a common institutional framework enabling greater clarification and enforcement of all the procedures and commitments under the GATT. The bi-annual Ministerial Conference presents an opportunity for permanent dialogue and monitoring of trade policies. This will complement and reinforce the scheduled negotiations in the drawn out 'Round' process. Although limited, the WTO presents a permanent structure in place of the provisional nature of the previous GATT enforcement and negotiating process.
In the short term, the WTO remains the 'shell' to which previous GATT agreements rest but it is more than likely to emerge in the coming years with its own distinct organisational niche in the multilateral trading system. The Organisation's impact may lie in its prevention of the breakdown future trade negotiations and the maintenance of forward momentum in the multilateral trading system.

This manual has been prepared as part of a series of training materials for use in programmes of capacity-building in policy formulation and analysis. Its aim is to explain the content of the Agreement on Agriculture and the main functions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to help agricultural policy analysts in developing countries assess the economic and administrative implications of the agreement. In particular, the manual is meant to help in the formulation of WTO-compatible agricultural domestic and trade policies, in building the analytical capacity to investigate new trade opportunities and in improving the understanding of the impact of the agreement on a country's food security.

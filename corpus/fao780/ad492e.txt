FAO working paper on financing sustainable forest management: FSFM/WP/07.
INFORMATION NOTE ON THE FAO PROGRAMME ON FOREST FINANCE.
It is generally accepted that financial considerations represent one of the most important factors that can have an impact on the implementation of sustainable forest management. With this in mind, the FAO Forestry Department has implemented a programme of work on forest finance, to examine how government policies (in forestry and other sectors) affect financing in the forestry sector and the consequences of such policies for sustainable forest management. One of the most important ways in which governments can have an impact on financing in the forestry sector is through the fiscal policies that they implement within the sector. Where forests are owned or managed by the state, the way in which charges for the use of forest resources are determined and implemented can have a major impact on the scale and types of investment in the sector. A vast literature has developed over the last 30 years examining this topic. Other fiscal policies, such as taxes and subsidies both within and outside the sector, can also have a significant impact on the forestry sector. The purpose of this work will be to review the impact of current fiscal policies on sustainable forest management, along with other related policies, such as land tenure, which have an impact on forest financing. However, the work will attempt to go beyond simple financial analyses of current policies (which have largely been done before) to examine the broader social, institutional and political aspects of policy reform. It is hoped that this work will assist forestry administrations to identify practical ways in which they can revise their fiscal policies, so that they can more easily pursue the goal of sustainable forest management. This work has been funded through the FAO Regular Programme and the EC Tropical Forestry Budget Line (FAO-EC Partnership Project on Sustainable Forest Management in African ACP Countries). A large part of the work has been produced by national consultants and institutions, with the supervision and assistance of FAO. Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted, but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information that they feel would be useful for this work.

This report describes the forest charges collected in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It shows that the forest revenue system is complicated, due to the large number of charges and the many different institutions collecting charges. Total forest charge collection is also generally very low. The report discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different types of charges and makes a number of recommendations for improvements to the forest revenue system.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
This report has collected what little information is available about forest revenue collection in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It describes the general structure of taxation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which includes a large number of different taxes and fees collected by many different agencies. There are also a large number of different forest charges, including charges on: area; volume harvested; turnover; export sales; equipment and workers; and turnover. In general, forest charges are quite low and the value of these charges has been eroded by inflation and changes in the currency used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Currently, the total amount of forest revenue collected is probably around USD 1.5 million per year. The process for collecting charges is quite simple, but there is little follow-up and supervision and it is suspected that tax evasion is high. Charge collection is decentralised and many of the charges are collected by provincial authorities. In terms of expenditure, there is a Fund for the Reconstitution of Forestry Capital, but the operation of the fund has been paralysed by the war. In addition to this, the Ministry for Land Affairs, Environment, Fishing and Forestry has an investment budget and operating budget from the central government. In 2000, the investment budget allocated to the ministry was around USD 10.9 million and the operational budget was USD 156,000. These two budgets account for five percent and 0.4 percent (respectively) of the total public expenditure on investment and operating costs. The report highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each of the different forest charges currently used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The main recommendations of the report are that the forest revenue system should be simplified; greater efforts should be made to follow-up and control tax evasion; greater attention should be paid to taxation of the informal forestry sector; and charges on the export of unprocessed products (logs) should be increased. However, improvements in financing the forestry sector will require an improvement in the general economic and security situation in the country.
INTRODUCTION.
This national report follows on from the project for sustainable forest management in the ACP African countries (GCP/RAF/354/EC) set up by FAO in the framework of its partnership programme with the European Community. Its aim is to aid national forestry administrations in ACP countries to direct their policies and institutions, as they should, so as to meet the goals of sustainable forest management in tropical African forests. The realisation of the above-mentioned aim comes through the knowledge and utilisation of flows of money from tax revenue on the one hand, and the public spending of the countries concerned on the other. This study proposes presenting the tax system for forestry as it currently operates in the Democratic Republic of Congo before proceeding to calculate the flows of money from the forestry sector to and from the government. In order to present the study in this way, we have subdivided the work into six parts. The first part deals with general points concerning Congolese taxation and ends with a presentation of forestry resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo and their importance compared to other forestry countries in the Congo Basin. In the second part, the report describes the tax system for forestry in operation in the country and analyses all the forestry taxes levied by the different bodies involved in tax collection. The third part of the report sets out the forestry tax administration of the country, the system for collecting taxes, the institutions that collect these taxes as well as the amounts of revenue collected. In the fourth part, the report presents public revenue granted by the State. The fifth part outlines State spending on forestry. Finally, the sixth part contains our comments and suggestions which the subject calls for before presenting our conclusions.
Difficulties encountered.
The drafting of such a national report in the absence of financial support and or logistical aid is all the more complicated when it is carried out in an economic environment where informality reigns and where collaboration takes place with a completely demotivated public administration in total decay. Here, where all studies of a sector which do not translate into money, people, as resources of information, become mistrustful and retain information. To overcome this difficulty in part, at least with regard to public revenue from forestry sectors and other sectors in the economy, we decided to research this information a step down from the tax network, that is, with the ministries responsible for forestry and public finance. With regard to taxes for which the rates are well known, we ourselves have collected taxable elements from different sources concerned by this study before going to calculate each tax and to compile all taxes. These calculations thus take out the total amount of revenue due to each service or business which could generate revenue. In relation to information on the State budget (revenue and expenditure), we benefited from the aid of heads of the ministry responsible for forestry in order to obtain statistics on revenue generated in 2000 which we will outline below.
Specialised work on forestry tax literature being lacking, we referred ourselves to publications of the time of the Forestry Management Support Project (FMSP), notably to the work entitled "Proposals for forestry taxation" (Ouellet, 1989) supplemented with the results of our studies of sectors carried out by the Forestry Development Bureau on the changes in proportional tax collected by the Fund for the Reconstitution of Forestry Capital (FRFC), as well as different texts, orders and decrees published by the ministry responsible for forestry to make up the contents of this report. Financial difficulties have prevented us from having photocopies of documents consulted as FAO requested, however we outline, at the end of this report, a bibliography of publications consulted. Finally, we would like to express our thanks to the FAO delegation in Kinshasa, the people responsible for the Congolese Monitoring Office and the General Office for Administrative, Judicial and Land Revenue and Contributions (GOALR) and all selfless persons for their contribution to the drafting of this report. We hope that it may contribute as much as possible to achieving the goals sought by FAO through its project for sustainable forestry management in our country.
GENERAL POINTS ON TAXATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.
The origins of tax collection.
Tax collection goes back to age-old times in history. In the Roman times, there were people responsible for collecting taxes who went around with wicker baskets which they used to transport gifts that the people offered to the Emperor Caesar, through taxes. These baskets were called "Fiscus Cesares" which means "Caesar's treasures", hence the term "fisc" which currently denotes the administration responsible for calculating taxes due and to collect them on behalf of the State.
Historical background on the tax system in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Regarding the tax system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, our ancestors also knew about taxation but in the form of deductions in kind (Dimandja, undated). Indeed, in precolonial times, village chiefs had the right to a part of hunting or harvest produce. When a distinguished visitor was being welcomed, they called on their subjects to contribute hens, eggs and goats so as to cover the costs of this particular visit. In their turn, they were supposed to provide banquets, to feed judges and soldiers and to offer goods to the needy among their citizens. All in all, the chiefs were responsible for finding remedies for problems likely to affect the public health of villagers, their personal safety and the safety of their goods. In order to achieve this, the support of each and every person was required. When colonial authority arrived, the Congolese of days gone by knew another type of tax called the "capitation tax" (caput means head) which means "tax per head", which consisted of a tax on each individual, without taking into account their resources or their assessments for tax. The aim of this tax was to obtain revenue for the State and particularly to combat inactivity by obliging those people liable for tax to get the necessary money to pay tax, thus forcing natives to abandon an economy of subsistence and to develop a market economy. Following on from this, a number of citizens developed trading and craft activity. Thanks to their determination and their business sense, they succeeded in creating quite significant and prosperous business. Others, luckily, occupied functions which had up until then been carried out by Europeans.
Aspects of the Congolese tax system.
Characteristics of the system.
Like all tax systems, the Congolese tax system is characterised by the multiplicity of taxes notably: · · · direct taxes on revenue; indirect taxes on spending; and taxes on capital.
Due to the regulatory effect of taxes in relation to the present state of the economy, taxation can be either spontaneous or organised by the authorities. For example, progressive taxes on revenue for immediate payment. Such a tax, at a time when revenue is increasing, always levies a bigger part of revenue, thus limiting the possibilities for saving and investment. Structural tax policies can work in encouraging or discouraging certain types of businesses. To encourage certain business people to transfer their activity to new areas for development, the State generally grants aid in two forms. · · Positive form: through subsidies and very low interest loans. Negative form: through exemptions or reductions in tax payments.
The Congolese State can also protect national industry by raising the tariffs on the rights of entry on foreign products in competition with similarly made products made in the country, thus practising interventionism. 2.3.2 The importance and role of Congolese taxation.
The importance of Congolese taxation is recognised at two levels of influence. The economic level. Positive influence - the State can promote national and foreign investment in sectors deemed to be priority areas for tax exemption and other tax advantages. Depending on the effect of costs, taxation can play an anti-inflationary role. Negative influence - taxation can also paralyse economic activity if tax rates are too high. The social level. The State uses tax to ensure the redistribution of revenue. The same applies to those citizens who benefit from reductions because they have several children in their homes.
General state of public finances.
Tax revenue and its redistribution in the country is an integral part of an accounting tool called the national budget. For this reason, we have deemed it appropriate to present here as follows, in few words, the national budget of the Democratic Republic of Congo before dealing with its forestry taxation.
Congolese State budget.
All institutions that aspire to rational management must have a vision and a more or less overall understanding of the process of evaluating and implementing the budget. Thus the budget can be defined as all the forward-planning annual accounts of resources and responsibilities of the State, of communities and public establishments. 2.4.2 Drafting of the Congolese State budget.
In conformity with Order-law number 774/002 of 2 January 1974 amending and supplementing Order-law number 69/0014 of 5 December 1969 pertaining to financial law, the Ministry for Finance is responsible for the preparation of the budget from tax revenue. This role gives it the title of the Ministry of Revenue. The instructions relative to the drafting of the budget of current spending are provided by the Ministry of the Budget. The budget is drafted in the form of a summary table with three columns where item by item the following elements are mentioned: · · · finances used in year X-1; finances allocated for the same items in year X; and finances in year X+1 suggested by financial officers to the budget controllers.
To these elements, there is a table of the number of staff including the personnel under statute and temporary staff, all in six copies and distributed as follows:.
2.4.3 a copy to the service concerned; a copy to the controller of spending; a copy to the head of the division or office for the provinces; a copy to the ministry for central services and to the governors of provinces; and two copies to the Ministry for Finance. Structure of the Congolese State budget.
The Congolese State budget is made up of two large parts divided into the headings of revenue and expenditure as follows:.
2. revenue in the budgetary framework; and revenue for social security.
In the revenue contained in the budgetary framework, there is tax revenue and non-tax revenue (Central Bank, 1995).
Tax revenue is made up of:.
taxes on foreign trade; taxes on the revenue of persons, companies, firms and fines; taxes on goods and services; exceptional taxes on payment of wages, paid by employers; special funds for boosting the economy, agriculture and other; other; and Gécamines.
Non-tax revenue is made up of:.
administrative, judicial and land revenue; portfolio revenue; royalties; Office for Management of Public Debt; and other.
With regard to the spending budget, it is made up of the institutions as follows:.
4. 2.4.4 political institutions (Presidency of the Republic, government, Prime Minister's Office etc.); ministries (more than 25); other services; and spending on order. Implementation of the budget.
Once the budget is approved and promulgated by the parliament, the budget should be implemented and applied. The implementation of the budget is not an automatic exercise. There are the requirements of management to be allied to the demands for rigorous methodology. 2.4.5 Budget commitment.
It is the act which legally obliges the State to take on the task of spending and this act thus renders the State a spender. Nevertheless, the State only becomes a spender definitively when the act that causes the spending is completed. The authority in power approves expenditure and manages the approved spending. Each ministry is by right, the main manager of its own ministry's budget. 2.4.6 Liquidation.
This is the observation and checking of its authenticity and legality allowing for a determining of its exact amount and to charge it to the appropriate budgetary loan. A provisional liquidation is carried out by persons authorising expenditure from each ministry or province. Exception being made for fixed spending or State subsidies, those authorised proceed to.
examine the letter of debt and establish their concordance with the service rendered and with the clauses of the initial commitment. Definitive liquidation is operated by the public revenue offices who monitor the admissibility of what is to be taken on by the treasury by ensuring the quality of documents attached to the declaration of debt, who checks that there is no duplicating with expenses already liquidated and if legal and regulatory provisions have been well observed and which, finally, monitors the regularity of charging the expenditure to the article of the budget to which it is linked. Liquidation, once completed, incurs the recognition of the debt by the State. 2.4.7 Order to pay.
This is the second last stage before payment. It is an order issued by the Ministry for Finance or by a delegated representative to the State cashier or accountant of the public revenue department to pay the debt in accordance with the liquidation. Certain expenses outlined by law can be paid without previous authorisation and others are regularised after payment. 2.4.8 Payment.
This is the accounting stage of implementing the spending budget, which brings about extinguishment and is carried out by a payment in cash or more often by cheque or bank transfer. The bank monitors and carries out payment orders and transfer orders or orders for funds to be forwarded, and it issues letters of credit or credit advice in the name of designated beneficiaries. 2.4.9 Nuances between fees and taxes.
Following this overview of taxation and the Congolese budget, we can say a word here about taxes which sustain the budget (Dimandja, undated). Tax and its characteristics. It is an obligatory pecuniary payment which is definitive and without immediate compensation on the resources of physical and moral persons. It is used to cover expenditure in the general interest of a community. It is characterised by the following eight features:.
8. tax is a means of transferring taxpayers' buying power; tax is a benefit in money, in cash; this benefit is not followed by apparent immediate compensation by the public authorities; coercion is a fundamental characteristic of tax; tax is the means at the State's disposal for policy implementation; tax is determined and collected according to fixed rules and not arbitrarily depending on the good will of the tax administration; tax is owed by individuals and societies due to the fact that they form an organised political community (the State) or because they benefit from revenue or some kind of advantage; and tax is brought to the budget.
Fees. Fees are a pecuniary payment that go to a specific and defined service and which are only paid by individuals who receive a specific State benefit.
Forestry resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
All forestry analysts are unanimous in recognising that the Democratic Republic of Congo, an immense country with a very large surface area at the heart of Africa (2,345,000 km²), has equally immense forestry resources estimated to be 128 million hectares. This last figure represents 58% of all tropical forests in the Congo basin and more than 52% of African tropical forests (IBRD, 1971). Table 1 below shows the distribution of forestry zones in Africa. Table 1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TAX SYSTEM FOR FORESTRY IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.
As a system, the tax system for forestry in the Democratic Republic of Congo is founded on the orders, laws and ministerial and inter-ministerial decrees of administrative regulations, which organise the collection of forestry taxes. The orders are signed by the President of the Republic and the decrees by the minister responsible for forestry. We will present here the name of each tax followed by the legal texts (order or decree) regulating it.
Surface area taxes.
This tax is levied by the Office for Forestry Management and Hunting under the Ministry responsible for forestry, in conformity with order number 86-114 of 10 April 1986. It is levied annually at no given period in the year and is currently USD 0.147 per 100 ha in concessions granted in a Supply Guarantee (decree number 042 of 7 February 1994).
Tax on felling permit.
Levied in accordance with decree number 009 of 7 September 1985 by the FRFC, this tax is paid annually when a felling permit is issued. Its value is currently USD 2.00 per hectare.1.
Tax on felled wood.
This tax falls into the domain of decentralised entities, that is, provincial coordinating bodies who levy and use it according to decree number 011 of 27 December 1985. Its calculation is based on information provided by wood harvesters themselves.
Tax on non-wood products (Forestry Products Menus).
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, non-wood products are linked to forestry products menus (FPM). This tax is applied to the purchase of firewood and charcoal, as well as to the harvesting and export of medicinal plants (for example: rauwolfia vomitoria, decorative roots, copal, wood bark etc. in accordance with decree number 42 of 7 February 1994). It is applied as follows: A. Construction wood (logs and poles) Category 1 from 0 to 0,010 m at : 0.28$US/m3 Category 2 from 0,11 to 0,30 m at : 0.28$US/m3 Category 3 from 0,31 to 0,050 m at : 0.084$US/m3.
According to decree number 042 of 7 February 1994, taxation is set based on the rate of exchange of USD 1.00 = NZ 35.00.
Tax on Forestry Products Menus · At harvesting · Rauwolfia · Voacanga and digitalia · Decorative roots · Gums, lacs, copal and other For export · Rauwolfia · Voacanga and digitalia · Decorative roots · Gums, lacs, copal and other.
Tax on transformed wood.
The consumer/buyer of sawnwood and plywood on the local market pays this tax in the form of Tax on Turnover, at 6.75% and which is then forwarded by the seller to the tax services in his area.
Tax on export of logs and transformed products.
The Fund for the Reconstitution of Forestry Capital (FRFC) levies this tax ad valorem to export in conformity with decree number 91 of 29 August 1988 which sets out the means of application as follows: 4% on logs 2% on sawnwood 1.5% on other products.
Tax on export revenues.
This tax is levied by the Customs and Excise Office (CEO) in conformity with order number 86-044 of 8 July 1986. It is 6% of currency brought back into the country. Tax on Turnover (TOT) - also levied by the Customs and Excise Office, this tax is instituted by order number 86-044 of 8 July 1986. Its rate was set in order number 69-058 of 5 December 1969. Another tax of the same name is levied at 18% by tax service agencies in the country. The basis for calculation is based on TOT Model "E" and the product sales contract.
Export taxes.
Tax on exit duties only apply to untreated roundwoods, even logs roughly hewn with an axe or adze, and following species named below:.

Remunerative tax.
This tax is levied by five State companies: the National Transport Office (NTO), the Maritime Freight Management Office (MFMO), the Customs and Excise Office (CEO), the Congolese Monitoring Office (CMO) and the Central Bank. It is fixed by order number 80-256 of 12 November 1980 and is applied in conformity with decree number 003/83 of 17 January 1983 which determines the amounts of commission to collect by MFMO for its intervention in loading and unloading freight operations. Table 3 summarises this information for each State company levying this tax as well as the services granted by them to economic operators who export wood. Table 3 Company NTO MFMO CEO CMO CB Companies benefiting from remunerative tax Services provided Opening of file. Weighing and tax on document. Intervention in loading and unloading operations. Form for declaring definitive exit. Quality and quantity control. Collection of proportional taxes and commission on exchange.
Tax on equipment and workers.
It is a tax based on harvesting and wood transformation equipment and the number of expatriate workers and the workforce. Paid annually, this tax is 30% of the equipment value.
Tax on revenue.
As for all other companies running in the country, forestry businesses pay tax on revenue to the State. This tax is 50% of gross revenue.
Historical information on these taxes.
Surface area tax. In spite of the flexibility of Zaire's currency throughout 1992, this tax remained fixed at Z 100/ha (that is USD 0.47/ha) (Decree number 10 of 6 April 1993) until the changeover of Zaire's currency to NZ in 1994. It was at this time that it was brought up to date and fixed at NZ 5 per 100 ha (decree number 42 of 7 February 1994). Tax on felling permit. It is one of the rare taxes which underwent change even though it stayed for a long time at NZ 100/ha before rising to NZ 350/ha in 1988 (that is USD 1.64/ha). It finally rose to USD 2.00/ha since 1996 (decree number 013 of 28 February 1996). Tax on wood for export (proportional taxes). These taxes also underwent change compared to their level before the setting up of the FRFC in 1985: Before 1985 Logs: Sawnwood: Veneer: Z 400/m3 Z 75/m3 Z 200/m3 After 1985 4.0% FOB value 1.5% FOB value 2.0% FOB value.
CEO tax on exit duties. This tax dropped from 7% to 6%. TOT and MFMO tax. They remained successively fixed at 6.75% and 0.5%.
Other taxes.
There is another form of tax undefined by the State, but which is paid in cash or in kind to decentralised bodies, more precisely to the traditional chiefs called " land chiefs", resident in forests designated for harvesting by the State. This "tax" called "Royaliste" in the Democratic Republic of Congo can vary from a motorised pirogue to a hunting rifle even to the setting up of a socio-economic infrastructure such as a bridge on a river, a village dispensary or a school shelter. It is the expression of a contradiction latent for a long time between land ownership law and the traditional vision of the notion of land ownership. This conflict will soon be resolved with the new forestry bill from the last forum organised in May 2000 with the aid of FAO and the UNDP in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are also purchasing licences and the sale of firewood and charcoal whose costs are collected by the urban councils, which are offshoots of the forestry administration. It should also be mentioned that felling permits are issued to small-scale harvesters, called pit sawyers, whose surface areas do not exceed 50ha per permit per year.
Even though harvesters of firewood and charcoal and pit sawyers regularly receive their licences and felling permits for industrial roundwood for processing, their harvesting activities totally escape the forestry administration out of a lack of monitoring and follow-up. It is the category of harvesters which makes up what is called the "informal forestry sector" because it goes untaxed. Nevertheless, the volumes of wood taken annually by this category of harvesters are, in the perspective of demand, two to three times higher than those taken by the formal forestry sector. Table 4 summarises the main forestry taxes in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Table 4.

ADMINISTRATION OF TAX SYSTEM FOR FORESTRY.
The tax administration for forestry in the Democratic Republic of Congo is made up of five services and public enterprises responsible for the collection of approximately ten taxes in relation to their areas of activity as the summary table presents them. Table 5 below presents the services and public enterprises as well as the taxes charged that they collect. Table 5 Services and public enterprises responsible for tax collection in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

N.B There is no mention made of the GOALR responsible for centralising all revenue from the State to the Central Bank.
Process of setting forestry taxes.
The processes for setting forestry taxes are based on two methods as follows: - - the grade-related method; and the declaratory method.
It is the latter which is most widespread in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Indeed, it is the harvester himself who, in making the quarterly tax declaration, determines the elements liable for tax. The tax is then calculated by the service collecting the tax on the basis of the declaration undersigned by the harvester and taken to be exact and honest. There is no means of calling on competition and taxes are not regularly updated. Information on taxes are published by means of ministerial decrees and put at the disposition of services that mobilise revenue, but are rarely published by the media. Taxes are decided by the Ministry responsible for forestry on proposals submitted by a permanent inter-ministerial commission composed of government experts and representatives of the Wood Profession and the Congolese Business Federation (CBF). This commission's decisions are taken on the basis of consensus before being passed under the form of a decree by the ministry responsible for forestry. Taking into account the flexibility of local currency, taxes are supposed to be revised annually depending on the current rate but that has not always been the case.
Collection of taxes and supervision.
In accordance with the texts of orders and various decrees regarding the setting of forestry taxes, public services and enterprises responsible for collection calculate taxes on the basis of volumes of wood felled in forests and declared by forestry harvesters. The evaluation of wood products and their grading according to their quality are done by harvesters themselves. Central administration, decentralised bodies (provincial coordination, districts and territorial supervisors) have a means of follow-up and monitoring of forestry harvesting, but this process has not been in use for a long time, simply due to the lack of finance. Only a few management tools, such as quarterly declaration forms and felling notebooks, are the link between those involved in tax collection and the creation of primary statistical information. The absence of follow-up and supervision surely give rise to tax evasion. Surface area tax is paid annually at the end of the year. Tax on felling permits is paid when the permit is being issued. It is the same for other remaining taxes which are paid when documents are issued ad hoc, the exception being proportional taxes (ad valorem) which are taken by the Bank when currency is brought back into the country.
Collection process.
The revenue stamp is the only proof of having paid dues to the public treasury department. The revenue stamp can be obtained from the General Office for Administrative, Judicial, and Land Revenue and Contributions (GOAJLRC) at commercial banks or again at financial institutions and other registered organisations in cash or by cheque. The person liable for tax obtains a collection or taxation document from the tax-collecting service concerned to know the amount to pay for the service, the document or the act which is required. The collection document established is transmitted by the service collecting the tax to a computer at the GOAJLRC allocated to each taxation service for a stamp with an order to pay. The order to pay confirms the amount to be paid and gives authorisation to the taxation service to receive the money. All revenue received following the order to pay is channeled by the GOAJLRC to the State fund, the Central Bank. An amount equivalent to only 5% of revenue collected will be kept to cover the operating costs of the service collecting the revenue. Tax on felled wood is supposed to be paid following a quarterly declaration, a copy of which is kept for the provincial coordination for this matter. However, given the absence of followup and monitoring, the wood harvester can make a declaration according to his conscience when he likes. At all levels and for all taxes, payment is made in cash. Local communities intervene neither in collection nor in monitoring the levels of wood harvesting in forests.
Government intervention at different levels of tax administration.
Government intervention in tax administration is dealt with at three main levels in the wood chain:.
2. In the forests or in the provinces, this is done by provincial coordination concerning tax on volumes of wood harvested (felled). At a central level, this is done by the OFMH, the FRFC and the Central Bank concerning successively surface area tax, tax on felling permits and proportional tax on exported wood products. There is also room here to mention tax on forestry products menus collected centrally by the OFMH. At the port where exports leave the country (Matadi) by the MFMO, the CMO and the CEO concerning successively the costs of intervention during loading, remunerative tax, the TOT and exit duties.
TOTAL AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE COLLECTED.
The total amount of annual collectable revenue is theoretically calculated according to two parameters, which are: the rate of tax and the volume of matter liable for tax. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the rate of tax is published by the text regulating the tax (order-law or ministerial decree), whilst the volume of material liable for tax is declared in the form of statistics, that is how much of the product has been harvested or exported, declared by the person liable for tax. Thus the latter becomes the most determining tax element in the total amount of revenue collected. Certain sources either collaborate in part or openly refuse to collaborate out of suspicion that there might be an enquiry or out of a spirit of meanness. Taking into account all that has gone before, we have proceeded to calculate the total amount of revenue collected by the Congolese State as the following table indicates. Table 6 Annual revenue per tax and per service mobilising revenue (USD).

Notes: 1 - Average of last 5 years according to 1998 annual report FRFC; 2 - Average of past 4 years; 3 - Average of past 3 years; n.a. = not applicable; revenue is shown in US dollars.
The above revenue is theoretical because: - - - certain felling permits established by the Ministry were not collected by those who requested them (for example, Forestière and Amexbois); taxes on exit duties are calculated just for the years 1997 and 1999 for which we have the export information per species; and remunerative tax collected by the CMO is calculated on total exports at a rate of 1.5% whereas it should be levied product by product, because the CMO no longer publishes export information per species.
On the basis of the table above, it can be concluded that the monetary flow from the forestry sector is about USD 1.4 million (average for 5 years). Revenue to the supervisory ministry is valued at Fc 4,527,286,53 or USD 181,091 (Table 7). Revenue generated by the forestry sector is higher than that generated by the Ministry responsible for forestry. The amounts collected by other players (CEO, MFMO, the CMO and the Central Bank) are not included in the revenue of the ministry managing forestry.

PUBLIC SPENDING ON THE FORESTRY SECTOR.
Spending from main public forestry institutions.
The only "institution" or forestry harvesting company in the Democratic Republic of Congo FORESCOM - was "privatised" by a process which up until now has not been cleared up. The other institutions are normative specialised services of the Ministry not having autonomy regarding their budget except the FCFC which operates on a budget on order, supplied by two taxes, that is, on the felling permit and the tax on wood exports (logs, sawnwood and veneer). The revenue from these two taxes is paid into a Resident Foreign Currency account (RFC). We will present the 1998 budget of the FRFC having briefly described the procedure in drafting it. 6.1.1 Drafting of FRFC budget.
The 1999 budget forecast was drafted on the basis of the following points:.
Ministerial decree number 13/CAB/MIN/ECNT/97 of 28 February 1997, setting taxes and the methods of collection of FRFC dues. For the 1999 year, the rates set were the following: - - Dues on felling permits: USD 2.00/ha Dues on wood exports: logs - 4.00% of FOB amount sawnwood - 2.00% of FOB amount veneer - 1.50% of FOB amount.
The average value of currencies in relation to the Congolese franc are rated at: USD 1.00 = Fc 3.50; and BEF 1.00 = Fc 0.10. For the production statistics for 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the working hypothesis used is acknowledging that forestry companies will be able to maintain for 1999 their average level of production for the years 1997, 1995, 1996 and 1997. The forestry surface area for harvesting in 1999 is thus estimated at 70,000 ha. The dues on wood harvesting are calculated on the basis of the annual average of revenue generated by forestry companies in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997.
The situation of this revenue can be summarised as follows: Product Logs Sawnwood Veneer Total Amount BEF 17,889,349 BEF 4,969,264 BEF 1,987,705 BEF 24,846,318.
The forecast for 1999 for the FRFC are presented as: dues on felling permits = Fc 490,000; and dues on wood exports = Fc 2,484,632.
1999 budget.
Revenue aspect. There is a fund that was specially created for forestry, it is the Fund for the Reconstitution of Forestry Capital (FRFC) which was to support twelve projects of reforestation and nine forestry services of the supervisory ministry for forestry. Its activities are today paralysed by the war that caused a ceasing of forestry activities for the most part of big wood production companies.

Spending aspect. In conformity with texts governing the use of FRFC loans, the revenue is used to finance projects on the one hand, and on the other, the operating of the FRFC secretariat in the following percentages: - - - Financing of projects: Operating of FRFC secretariat: Total budget in 1999 70% of the budget 30% of budget Fc 2,082,242 Fc 892,330 Fc 2,974,632.
Spending affected by the financing of these projects is broken down as follows: Payments Operating costs Investment (equipment) Total 42.2% 30.0% 19.8% 100.0%.
Public spending on investment for the 2000 tax year was Fc 5,196,640,822 or USD 208,000,000 and Fc 272,568,000 or USD 10,902,720 of expenditure allocated to forestry, that is 5% of capital investment (see Table 9). Regarding the operating budget estimated at Fc 956,073,378 or USD 38,242,951, an amount of Fc 3,902,200 or USD 156,088 or 0.4% was allocated to forestry (see Table 10).

Other intervention.
Since the first pillaging in 1991 which put an end to structural cooperation with sponsors, that is more than ten years ago, the Democratic Republic of Congo has no longer received foreign aid destined for forestry, with the exception of the UNDP and FAO. They financed the holding of two conferences in May 2000 on forestry policy in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Subsidies to the private forestry sector.
Congolese law does not cater for this type of subsidy and there are practically no companies or individuals operating in the sector of forestry management.
Revenue and expenditure of State forestry companies.
The only forestry company of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FORESCOM) was privatised following the rupture with Canadian cooperation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.
Introduction.
This last part of the report is dedicated to changes, tax per tax, in the tax system for forestry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It will then highlight its impact on sustainable forest development and will give an order of greatness to public spending specifically destined for sustainable management before giving a commentary on the attitude of the government in the face of changes in the country's forestry sector. However, before proceeding with a proper evaluation of the tax system for forestry, it is appropriate to speak here of the characteristics and criteria of eligibility for a forestry tax system on which the evaluation of the tax system for forestry in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be based. 7.1.1 Characteristics of forestry taxation.
Before dealing with the characteristics of taxation, the economics dictionary defines it as a system of laws and administrative regulations that organises tax collection. Thus a tax system for forestry must: - - - - - - be a source of revenue based on an equitable value of forestry resources; be able to promote a rational use of the resources; allow for the renewal of potential for future generations; contribute to the conservation of the patrimony; encourage suitable growth in the industry and its exports; and allow for a greater contribution to GNP from the forestry sector.
Administration costs and feasibility. Certain taxes for their management require a small number of staff, other taxes need a large number of staff, involving administration costs which cancel out any profit margin. Administrative feasibility is measured in terms of manpower required for supervision, the measuring of wood and the collection of these taxes. The existence of services with a specific responsibility for forced collection of taxes (or to crack down on offences) affects administrative costs and the feasibility of a taxation system. It is the same for other costs paid for by the forestry industry to conform to the different taxes, even if the costs are not the responsibility of the tax administration. These costs affect the overall economic efficiency of the taxation system. Economic efficiency in forestry management. A good system of forestry taxation can contribute to an improvement in forestry management by encouraging the use of secondary or not widely known species by restraining total forest deforestation and thus improving economic efficiency. On the other hand, an inappropriate tax system can lead to extra expenses in the application of forestry regulations and thus lead to management problems. Equity in the redistribution of economic spin-offs and revenue. The different taxes or expenses associated with the taxes can, by their impact on harvesting activities, measuring, local transformation, transport or other, have important consequences on employment, the.
availability of transformed forestry products on price, and by the fact even of the redistribution of revenue.
Types of tax and methods of taxation.
The types and methods are defined according to the object liable for tax:.
2. On what the taxes are collected, for example: the surface area, volume, value or profits. In relation to the place where the taxes are levied, for example: in a forest, by the side of a road, in the factory at export ports etc.
According to the localisation of services mobilising revenue, the following can be distinguished: forestry taxes collected centrally and for which rates of tax and elements liable for tax are well known, both by the administration and by the person liable for tax; and forestry taxes collected by decentralised bodies (in the provinces) for which the diversity in rates of tax added to the confusing changes in the country's sociopolitical situation have ended up by making their statistics inaccessible to central administration.
This part of the report will only evaluate forestry taxes collected centrally including taxes collected at export ports. 7.2.1 Surface area tax Surface area granted in a Supply Guarantee. Annual. Administration. This tax does not reflect the value of surface areas granted, even though it may be potentially significant. Easy to administrate with a low risk of evasion. Too low in order to encourage the freezing of forestry territory obtained in the form of a Supply Guarantee. The rate of this tax does not reflect the value of alternative use of concession. The tax implies redistribution between the concessionaire and the State. Putting up for auction could be used to set a rate which at least reflects the value of alternative use of the concession.
Basis for taxation Payment Method of setting tax Revenue to the State Administration Efficiency.
Redistribution of revenue Suggestion.
Tax on felling permit Volume of standing wood or the estimated value of the surface area granted and the wood to be found there. Annual when results are known of allocation inventory. Administration. More significant than the surface area tax. Theoretically more important but this revenue is practically counterbalanced by inventory costs. Tax inapplicable in most cases due to risks linked to: - the inaccuracy and the cost of forestry inventories; and - the assessment of the value of surface areas granted. Very low rate of efficiency due to the risks of rapid liquidation of all wood having reached its industrial potential for harvesting. This would not be the case if this tax were based on a yearly possibility for felling. A tax collected on this basis would have a discouraging effect on the harvesters in carrying out a freezing of concessions. It equally implies a redistribution of revenue between the concessionaire and the State.
Redistribution of revenue.
Proportional taxes (ad valorem) Volume exported. When currency is brought back into the country. Administration following consultation. Major source of revenue. Can bring in even more if the rate were set so as to reflect the real value of species and if it were adjusted depending on price fluctuations (selling price and inflation). For example, the sawing of African Mahogany and Tola indiscriminately bring in 2% of their FOB value to State coffers, whereas Mahogany is a more valuable species compared to Tola. Administration is straightforward except that the assessment by volume brings about many abuses because of measuring leading to a lower volume compared to the real volume, a common occurrence in export ports. Encourages selective felling. Does not reflect the real value of the best species. A rate that would represent the real value would encourage felling of more species and would become a forestry management tool.

Administration.
Tax on logs and transformed products Value of logs and exported transformed products. Ad valorem when currency is brought back into the country (% on FOB value). Administration or according to a conventional formula.. Logs - constitutes the most part of forestry revenue to the state and encourages domestic transformation, all bearing profit. Export tax of transformed products - is usually low in order to stimulate local transformation. Administration is easier than those taxes based on volume. Influence of forestry management in the same way that taxes are based on volume. Can vary according to species, quality, transport distances and harvesting conditions. The same applies for taxes on transformed products. By encouraging local transformation, these taxes imply redistribution because they: create employment; generate additional revenue; influence prices and product availability; and increase state revenue for greater added value. Taxes on the export of logs can be substituted for taxes based on volumes of felled wood. They can turn out to be a good source of revenue with the incentive for local transformation. However, they alone cannot reach the two objectives if they are not linked to other forestry taxes on logs and export taxes on forestry products.
Administration Efficiency.
Remunerative tax Inspection expenses in measuring, grading, ports and other. Punctual. Administration. It is solely used to cover service costs. The tax should reflect costs and be adjusted depending on these. This does not seem to be the case because these same costs can be collected by more than one body (the CMO, the CEO). This sometimes involves additional charges for the exporter.
Basis for taxation Payment Method of setting tax Revenue to the State Administration.
Tax on equipment and workers Equipment for harvesting and transformation and the number of expatriate workers. Annual. Administration. Generally speaking, it is not high. This is simple and easy because it is based on items that are easily identifiable and quantifiable. It influences the use of equipment and the substitution of labour and capital.

Taxes on forestry products menus (FPM) products, companies, and individuals who produce them per item or on value administration or ad valorem This is symbolic out of a concern to redistribute revenue and to circumvent the problem of tax evasion. This is simply applied. Several small-scale producers dispersed throughout the country who are difficult to monitor generally carry out the harvesting of forestry product menus. A simple tax, not too high, and simply levied is necessary to avoid tax evasion. Tax is too low because it provokes over-harvesting of forestry product menus. Very good as the tax is low. Encourages production. Can lower imports and petroleum products. The production of firewood benefits the rural population on low incomes.

Commentary and suggestions for tax system.
Surface area tax which today is USD 0.147 per 100 hectares continues to favour the freezing of forestry territory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Suggestion: either to proceed by putting forests up for tender or to set taxes depending on stock tables or volumes per stratum of the forest so that it can more or less reflect the value of alternative uses of concessions. Tax on felling permits can remain at its current rate. Felling tax collected by decentralised bodies (in provinces) today encourages tax fraud in that there is no means of follow-up nor of monitoring the land. Only the good faith of harvesters counts. However it is a yawning gap for setting up a participatory management of forestry resources with resident populations who would benefit from these taxes. It is the same situation for other provincial and agricultural taxes that vary in the provinces. There is room to harmonise those that are justifiable and to remove those for which the "agricultural" interest is not justified in the forestry sector.
Duties on wood products for export. This tax levied by the FRFC makes up the greatest part of the Congolese State forestry revenue. It could produce even more if it were set according to market prices instead of the FOB price in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Remunerative tax should reflect costs and be adjusted in relation to the variation in services granted instead of being an all-inclusive sum. Tax on forestry product menus can be maintained low because if it were too high it would not lessen the risk of over-harvesting resources but would bring about tax evasion. Tax on equipment can be used as an incentive to renew ever more efficient forestry equipment. It can be removed for the arrival of new equipment. On the other hand, we recommend, taking into account the dispersion of their harvesters and the difficulties in monitoring them, that the forestry administration finalise their census already begun, in order to organise these countless small harvesters who annually take volumes of wood, estimated to be two to three times greater than quantities of industrial roundwood for processing taken by wood industrialists. The objective would be to tax this sector whose activities continue to escape State monitoring. Making this so-called informal sector subject to tax would allow for: - - - more tax revenue for the State who badly need it; to establish justice in the population (Buabua Wa Kayembe, 1995); and make the sector benefit from the advantages envisaged by tax law in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Commentary and general suggestions.
The forestry economy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, like its economy in general, is an economy essentially directed towards foreign trade. This also implies a tax policy for forestry favourable to the expansion of industry and the significant increase in volumes of exports. Now, a quick overview of wood exports from the Democratic Republic of Congo for the 1994-1998 period reveals a certain stagnation for the last three years of this period and a drastic drop of almost 50% for the last two years (see Table 11). This is also true for the value of these exports. If the drop can be attributed to the different wars that paralyse the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the stagnation observed even in the pre-war period can be attributed to the absence of a forestry policy directed towards the renewal and expansion of forestry equipment.

For this reason we suggest: Short term. The assessment of tax duty on exported logs, currently set at 4% ad valorem whereas Indonesia takes 20% ad valorem, is awaiting the industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo to develop more. Long term. Total removal of export of logs from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1982, Indonesia reserved export quotas for logs for only the firms building factories in the country. In 1985, there was a total ban on the export of logs. The result was that from 40 units in 1981, the industrial stock in Indonesia went to 107 units in 1987, that is an increase of 37%. Closer to home, in Cameroon, similar measures taken in 1982 encouraged log exporters to become wood manufacturers. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, these incentives can be applied to more expensive logs such as Afrormosia, Wenge, Doussie and Longhi. Weak points of the system. Multiplicity of taxes. Absence of follow-up and monitoring with the consequence of tax fraud at all levels particularly in forestry and at exit ports. Qualitative and quantitative under-valuation of products. Volumes measured include sapwood as well as log, which is harmful to the producer country and the exporter. Freezing of forestry concessions due to the low level of surface area tax. Strong points of the system. Substantial contribution of revenue to the State. The system both redistributes revenue horizontally and vertically due to the low level of most of these taxes. Provides incentives. Simple application for most of its taxes. Follow-up. Follow-up leaves much to be desired. The government could increase revenue it receives by improving the efficiency of collection and by widening the tax band in the informal forestry sector. Recommendations: - - - - to keep the number of taxes low; to raise taxes on untreated products (logs); to motivate and equip the tax administration; and to reactivate the procedure for follow-up and monitoring.
Impact of the tax system for forestry on the forestry administration.
Improvement in management by encouraging people to use secondary species, said to be "other species". Loss in competitiveness of products on foreign markets in relation to the multiplicity of taxes. Exhaustion of resources by harvesters of forestry product menus. Unrestrained harvesting of cheap resources with the threat of extinction of certain endemic species of the flora and fauna. Destruction of forests by holders of purchasing licenses and for sale of wood or charcoal. Specific mechanisms for protecting forestry resources: export quota linked to certain species like Limba; demand for a special permit for harvesting certain species like Wenge; and ban on industrial harvesting of certain species like ebony. Incentive for good management is low. Inefficiency is there also due to a lack of follow-up. The effect of taxes can be considered equitable but economic efficiency is affected by the existence of a service particularly responsible for the forced collection of taxes. Recommendation: measures to promote the conservation of resources must be used in waiting for the promulgation of forestry law. Reduce as much as possible the number of taxes depending on the "age" of the forestry industry of the country.
Public spending on forestry administration.
The stage of implementing the criteria and indicators for the sustainable management of forests has not already been crossed in the Democratic Republic of Congo because of the hesitation of sponsors (USAID) following the war which paralyses the country. It would seem premature to me to mention financing before the end of the war. 7.4.1 Critical problems that would hinder financing.
The absence of budgetary autonomy for certain forestry services. Excessive centralisation of revenue to a central fund, payments from which are always late, thus paralysing all planned activity. Recommendation - internal financing: allow retention of 50% of the revenue to the service who generates it or centralise only 50% of revenue collected; and put in place a mechanism for the rigid monitoring of use. Recommendation - external financing: use a "budget for order" accompanied by a mechanism for rigid monitoring. 7.4.2 Impact of other tax measures.
The quest for new agricultural land in the framework of food self-sufficiency is accompanied by the destruction of forests. Shifting agriculture clears forests. A beneficial action would be the introduction of agro-forestry in village agriculture.
Attitudes in the face of change.
The Democratic Republic of Congo's government favourably welcomed the advent of sustainable forest management (SFM) and its positive attitude is witnessed in the will clearly expressed to be present at all meetings concerned with this area in spite of fluctuating economic difficulties. The socio-economic and environmental future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and of all humanity is at stake. The government's overall support of the forestry sector is 2% of the spending budget. The sector employs a staff of approximately 3,581 people and it is always quoted in speeches on general policy. Two conferences were organised in May 2000 with the aid of FAO and the UNDP on the country's forestry policy. It is appropriate to take on board the improvements suggested above so as to increase the contribution of forestry resources to finance SFM.
Exactly ten years ago, we were able to conclude with Ouellet (1991) that even the best tax system for forestry that there could be, could not be applied successfully in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was then the Republic of Zaire. This was taking into account a large number of obstacles to overcome in order to bring the country's forestry revenue under control. Today, since the political changes which took place at the head of the country, it is noticed that something has changed, and better still, certain tax and non-tax parameters have changed particularly: · · · · the political will to do things better is evident; the setting up of the GOALR which today channels all revenue towards State funds; the restructuring of the Ministry responsible for forestry in order to make it more effective; and the drafting of a new forestry law which awaits promulgation, replacing the old law of 1941.
There are so many factors which militate in favour of the dawn of a new mentality, so creating a new attitude in the management of public affairs. In spite of difficult economic circumstances throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo, we believe that the forestry industry is still able to make an ever greater contribution to the economy of this country, even if it means pruning the current tax system in order to free it of all aspects constraining it by: · · harmonising provincial taxes; reassessing and legalising royalties;.
obtaining the promulgation of the new forestry law; removing the duplication of certain taxes such as TOT (6.75% and 18%); taxing the informal forestry sector for increasing State tax revenue; establishing tax justice in the population; enabling the informal forestry sector to benefit from tax advantages envisaged by tax legislation; doing away with entry duty on new forestry equipment; reasonably increasing exit duties on logs; and re-evaluating the FCFC in conformity with the decree creating it.
Once rid of these constraining tax and non-tax burdens, associated with non-tax parameters and harmonised with other tax systems for forestry in sub-regions, the tax system for forestry in the Democratic Republic of Congo can become an important source of financing for the sustainable management of forestry resources and a factor in integration and sub-regional cohesion. Managed on a long term basis, the immense forestry resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo are able to effectively contribute to the maintaining of a delicate balance between the conservation of nature, the socio-economic development of populations of this country and the quality of the environment for the largest number of human beings, for present generations and those to come.

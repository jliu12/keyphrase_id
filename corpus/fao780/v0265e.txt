How to define desertification
Chapter 12 of Agenda 21, as approved by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), defines desertification as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities". This definition is simplistic, as it does not express clearly the constant interaction between climatic factors and human activities - the latter often being decisive in triggering desertification processes.
Nevertheless, it seems important to state that, in certain parts of the world, desertification processes (land degradation) operate in the absence of human activities, where such activities are negligible because of low population density.
The natural recurring drought processes, which may be caused by global climatic changes that are difficult to evaluate, may lead to land degradation, thus endangering the peoples in and around those areas, or preventing future land use. Although it might appear vain to combat such "geological" desertification, it is nonetheless essential to help local communities confront the situation and adapt to it without making it worse.
The link between desertification and human activities is thus a generally accepted concept and FAO suggests that this link be clearly defined as:
"The sum of the geological, climatic, biological and human factors which lead to the degradation of the physical, chemical and biological potential of lands in arid and semi-arid zones, and endanger biodiversity and the survival of human communities."
This definition is close to that approved by the 1977 UN Conference on Desertification, in Nairobi:
"... intensification or extension of characteristic desert conditions; the process entails a reduction in biological activity and plant biomass, in livestockcarrying potential of land, in agricultural yields and a decline or degradation in man's living conditions."
What lands and areas are prone to desertification?
FAO considers the criteria established at the Nairobi Conference as the basis for the concept of "desertification risk", assessed by measuring land vulnerability in combination with current and future demotic and agricultural pressures. To use such criteria means considering desertification processes as evolving according to changing human and climatic factors. As a consequence, each country needs to have ways of analysing these processes on the basis of globally accepted criteria
As a first measure, FAO recommends that countries some 99 according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - with arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid lands prone to desertification be encouraged to tackle these processes, which affect nearly one thousand million human beings living on 35-40 million km^2 or about 30 percent of the world's land surface.
What are the main causes of desertification?
First it is advisable to state that desertification as previously defined can only occur on land prone to desertification processes. The vulnerability to desertification of land is determined by current climate, relief, and the state of the soil and natural vegetation. Climate has a major influence through three factors rainfall, solar radiation and wind- which all affect physical and mechanical erosion phenomena and chemical and biological degradation. Relief acts mainly to exacerbate water erosion. The state of the soil, in terms of its texture, structure and chemical and biological status, is a predominant factor in dry subhumid zones, where climate has less impact; it plays a crucial role in vulnerability to desertification through human activities. The same applies to the state of the natural vegetation: the result of past and recent influences; of climatic, pedological and often, human factors. Because of their longevity and powerful root systems, trees are a primary
source of protection from soil degradation and their absence, too often caused by human action, is a serious handicap.
Human activities are the main factors triggering desertification processes on vulnerable land. These activities are many and vary by country, society, landuse strategies and the technologies applied. The impact of human society does not depend solely on its density. FAO believes that the concepts of "carrying capacity" and "critical threshold" need to be considered with care, as many examples demonstrate that these criteria can evolve according to the strategies and technologies applied by local people.
Some of the human activities that can cause desertification are:
* cultivation of soils that are fragile, or exposed to erosion by wind or water;
* reduction in the fallow period of soils, and lack of organic or mineral fertilizers;
* overgrazing - often selectively - of shrubs, herbs and grasses;
* overexploitation of woody resources, in particular for fuelwood;
* uncontrolled use of fire for regenerating pasture, for hunting, for agricultural clearing, or for settling certain social conflicts;
* agricultural practices that destroy the soil structure, especially the use of unsuitable agricultural machinery;
* agricultural practices that result in the net export of soil nutrients, leading to loss of the soil fertility, such as cash-cropping;
* diversion of rivers to create irrigation schemes; or
* irrigation of soils prone to salinization, alkalinization or even waterlogging.
All these activities derive from two root causes. The first five are typical of poverty and underdevelopment, while the rest result from "modern" development that disregards the impact of the technologies used on land sustainability.
Factors typical of the first category include:
* undernourishment or malnutrition, leading to physical weakness and vulnerability to disease;
* no access to credit, thus preventing any chance of investment in tools, seeds or fertilizers;
* limited access to basic schooling and technical training;
* a search for short-term survival strategies (e.g. annual or seasonal migration);
* the lack of any framework to support rural communities with technical advice, infrastructure, access to energy, training, organization of barter exchanges or market access; and
* the lack of basic security.
The second category includes factors such as:
* the search for immediate results through increased production;
* international competition and unfavourable terms of exchange between primary products (particularly agricultural) and manufactured goods; and
* insufficient knowledge of the long-term consequences of applying particular technologies.
What are the main consequences of desertification?
The consequences of desertification - the phenomenon of land degradation - depend on four factors that vary by region, country and year:
* the seriousness and extent of land degradation;
* the severity of climatic conditions at the lime (especially annual rainfall);
* the number and diversity of affected populations; and
* the level of development of the country involved.
The poorer the peoples and the less developed the countries involved, the more profound will be the future effects of desertification, and the greater the potential for tragedy when natural conditions, especially climatic, become difficult.
Desertification should be viewed as a breakdown of the fragile balance that allowed plant, human and animal life to develop in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones. This breakdown of the equilibrium and of the physical, chemical and biological processes that sustain it, represents the start of a process of self-destruction for all elements of the life system. Thus soil vulnerability to wind and water erosion, the lowering of the water-table, the impairment of the natural regeneration of vegetation, the chemical degeneration of soils - themselves all immediate results of desertification - worsen the situation. Desertification feeds on itself.
Consequently, the effects of desertification are extremely serious and often dramatic for the poor populations of developing countries. By limiting natural potential desertification reduces production and makes it increasingly precarious. Forced to attend to the most urgent things first, populations resort to survival strategies that unfortunately make desertification worse and prevent any development.
The most immediate and generally widespread of these survival strategies is to intensify overexploitation of the most readily available natural resources, but at the cost of enormous effort. The second strategy is to sell off everything owned, including agricultural equipment, to cope with the monetary needs of development (e.g. schooling, social services, contributions to pump maintenance), or food crises (buying food). The third strategy is increasing rural migration: this may simply involve men and young people leaving for a seasonal or longer-term job in other areas of the country, particularly the towns, or going to other countries; or the migration may take on the proportions of a population exodus in search of better living conditions.
These survival strategies are often accompanied by breakdowns in the integrity of communities and sometimes of families. When survival is difficult, people become withdrawn and sometimes strongly individualistic, which leads to ethnic, family or individual conflict.
Finally, desertification exacerbates the effects of climatic (drought) and political (war) disasters, regularly leading to the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world.
All these factors weaken still further the economies of developing countries affected by desertification, particularly those countries that have no resources other than agriculture and those where almost all the territory is affected. In this respect, African countries in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones are particularly prone to desertification and affected by its consequences. Their economies are powerless to break the fatal cycle of poverty that leads them to face up to emergencies by taking on more and more increasingly untenable debt. This in turn precludes any future possibility of productive investments to break the circle of underdevelopment.
However, desertification can lead to a positive change in some behaviour, especially that of women facing problems caused by the absence of men who have gone in search of work, and the aspirations of young people towards a less demanding life. This extra work and responsibility lead to two new attitudes:
* requests for equal access to land, especially land managed by those concerned. Group approval is often the first step in achieving this aim. Women willingly look for compromises in accordance with the basic rules of the community. This is a powerful factor for mobilizing women, and one that should be neither ignored nor underestimated in the fight against desertification;
* a growing awareness of the need to space out births; women are often eager to do this in many parts of the world, subject to men's approval and government support.
While desertification has brought about a sharp reduction in agricultural equipment, it has also helped to multiply and broaden technical knowledge, especially on the environment and its conservation. Micro-projects undertaken in many places over the last 15 years have resulted in a wealth of knowledge and some practical techniques. This is a starting-point that should not be neglected. Similarly, many rural people's perception of the environment and their relationship with it is changing, or has already changed in some places. The environment is increasingly being conceived as:
* a sensitive area that has been overneglected and overexploited, requiring work and management efforts to repair the results of past mistakes and precipitate action; and
* belonging to the rural peoples, whose wish to appropriate land and organize themselves into groups, cooperatives, village development associations, autonomous local associations, etc., is evolving and augurs well for the future.

Understanding, monitoring and forecasting the processes of desertification
Assessment and monitoring of desertification processes
Strengthening basic knowledge of desertification processes
The first programme area mentioned in Chapter 12 of Agenda 21 on desertification aims at:
"strengthening the knowledge base and developing information and monitoring systems for regions prone to desertification and drought, including the economic and social aspects of these ecosystems."
In fact, evaluations carried out on the state and development of desertification, whether on a world or regional scale, have revealed gaps in the knowledge about the geographical extent and evolution of the processes. Since very few countries have the means to observe and analyse the phenomena of the desertification processes FAO considers that positive action is required to reinforce national capabilities in this sphere.
Assessment and monitoring of desertification processes
Despite modern observation techniques using satellite imagery and software to analyse recorded data, there is still a great deal of uncertainty at the local, national and world level as to the origin, extent and gravity of the desertification processes. This uncertainty handicaps natural resource managers in planning and decisionmaking. It also restricts warning and emergency plans for agricultural production and other risks (e.g. locust invasions). FAO believes that improvements should address acquisition systems as much as communication and analytical methods and end products in order to strengthen the efficiency of national and regional centres so as to deal better with the actual needs of users and decision-makers.
Problems to be resolved include:
* acquisition of data and production of basic data: information suited to needs;
* storage and analysis: where, what format, on what scale and at which frequency, which system and for what end product? and
* dissemination and communication of products to users.
These problems are the same for all basic geographical, meteorological, hydrological, ecological, land and socio-economic data, whether from remote sensing satellites or from the various survey, observation and census networks and stations.
These problems involve improving and harmonizing data from meteorological satellites such as NOAA and METEOSAT in order to:
* have standard, compatible outputs for the exchange of information and for analysing various data of common interest to different end-users; and to
* provide products to aid decision-making in agricultural warning and forecasting (in particular by estimating rainfall and plant activity).
Knowledge is also needed about the exploitable aquifer reserves of large catchment areas; methods of estimation vary, and yield very different and non-comparable results. Concerted scientific activity would enable managers and decision-makers to obtain reliable information on groundwater reserves as well as the necessary management tools in the form of maps or information adapted to their needs.
Another problem is the need to improve soil degradation assessments at the world and regional levels, as well as at national and local levels. This could be accomplished by combining remote-sensing information from satellites, such as I.ANDSAT or SPOT, with data from ground observation sites. At the national level, despite substantial progress, results are still a long way from satisfying demands for information. FAO supports the establishment and strengthening of national centres to study and observe natural resources. National remote-sensing and ecological monitoring centres could continuously monitor climatic change and land degradation, and map information with remote-sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GISs).
FAO believes that information is most important and most needed at the local and national levels. The results of analysing high-resolution spatial and spectral satellite pictures, such as LANDSAT or SPOT, combined with those from satellites with higher temporal frequency and low spatial resolution, such as METEOSAT or NOAA, could be integrated into GISs and spatial models and complemented by new methods of gathering ground data through navigation satellites. FAO supports the development of these methods, which enable both biophysical and socio-economic data to be observed, evaluated and monitored.
Strengthening basic knowledge of desertification processes
It is fairly simple to understand drought. In contrast, desertification is a complex, evolutionary process resulting from several factors with implications in all fields, including human behaviour, and having a continuous effect on all elements of the ecosystem. Efforts must be made to clarify this complex issue and understand its mechanisms. A whole spectrum of research needs to be carried out, particularly in the nerds of:
* climatic monitoring and forecasting - improving and validating techniques for analysing satellite data in order to estimate and correlate reliable and significant indicators (vegetation indices, surface temperature, evaporation, insolation, albedo, dust, etc.); and understanding and quantifying climatic variables, in order to be able to monitor the situation and climatic impact;
* study of genetic diversity and its erosion;
* land occupation and use;
* drainage, salinization and alkalinization of soils;
* vegetation development;
* relationships between animal and plant resources;
* population dynamics;
* ways of managing natural resources (e.g. agropastoral, agroforestry and pastoral systems); and
* the impact of natural resource management policies on these resources.
Action must be taken to integrate information resulting from such research. It would seem desirable, at subregional and national levels, to set up some form of GIS to provide the main physical and socioeconomic data of interest to natural resource managers and decision-makers in charge of rural development in areas subject to desertification.

Strategy for combating desertification (and drought)
Guiding principles
Strategic objectives and components
Operational implementation
Guiding principles
Human beings are at the heart of the desertification problem, either as actors or victims. The fight against desertification is a fight for survival. It is an integral part of the socio-economic development programmes of land resources and the inhabitants of concerned areas. The main goal is to enlist the people, government technical services and non-governmental organizations to promote the complete participation of the population. This approach (often termed global and participatory) is built on five main principles.
The principle of integration aims primarily at integrating the immediate, medium- and long-term needs of the population. The immediate needs are food, health, education and financial income while the medium- and long-term needs are generally less identifiable and more vaguely expressed, and include the defence, rehabilitation and management of available natural resources. Responses to these two types of needs are closely interdependent: satisfying immediate needs will be risky and provisional if land resources are not improved and rehabilitated; land and resource management will be hampered if immediate needs are unfulfilled. This integration principle also extends to the integration of techniques and actions to satisfy the above needs in a clear and coordinated manner, and to avoid any contradiction in implementation or its aftereffects. It also encompasses the integration of traditional experience open to modernization with recent experimental experience obtained under
similar circumstances. Finally, it concerns the integration of human resources at all levels, with the double goal of popularizing techniques and promoting popular participation.
The consultation principle is based on people's participation, even more so than the integration principle. It is practiced at several levels:
* consultation within a community enables the community to take decisions, organize and manage its work while sorting out differences or conflicts between the various elements. In order to obtain expression, such consultation requires a village organization, either already existing or that will need to be set up;
* consultation between communities is often necessary where they occupy the same catchment area or both use a particular area. Such consultation serves not only to solve conflicts but also to organize mutual assistance, to exchange experiences, or to set up joint bodies for specific activities, for savings or credit, etc.;
* consultation between local communities and regional and national institutions, and with bodies supporting or administering development, should be organized at government level. The quality and permanence of such consultation depends on the government's political organization and its organization of support services to development;
* consultation between development and aid organizations (services, projects, non-governmental organizations) is essential, at least to avoid conflicts and competition and at best to maximize the use of their resources and the effects of their support.
The principle of planned spatial approach is fundamental to securing coherent action. To imagine regional and national development as an extension of local land management would be dangerous, for three main reasons.
* It is not possible to operate effectively in all land areas at the same time, and thus it is necessary to proceed stage by stage within a rational - and agreed - programme on test areas for experience to be gained by, on the one hand, the people in charge and the population affected and, on the other, the projects and services working with them. These examples are then transferred to other areas through a joint effort of the technical services and the people involved with the population of the test area.
* Each community is itself part of a much larger whole. Therefore the community should maintain relations with other communities through regional' and national organizations that support development in a certain technical, social and economic environment. These all exert influences and pressures which should be oriented and channelled so as not to be in contradiction with the community's position.
* The need to act within the regional framework of the test area is also justified in order to reduce development gaps between the test and other areas by the latter being enabled to apply the lessons of the test area. Therefore the global approach is also practiced in a second spatial setting, that of the region where the test area is located, which may be agro-ecologically or socio-economically defined, but is usually an administrative region. At this level, the favoured tool is regional land planning to help integrate managed land areas. Finally, and for similar reasons as before, the global approach implies establishing a relationship with land management at the national level. The global approach does not lead to a breaking-up of territory; on the contrary, it tries to secure consistency among all the local, regional and national components.
The principle of decentralization of decision-making and modalities of action is essential to success. The global and participatory approach should be implemented within an organizational framework of integration, consultation, planning, management and action. This framework ensures essential analytical and conceptual functions, but more specifically training, coordination and implementation of methods and action. The basic organizational unit is the village or community. At the regional level, the global approach programme has two interdependent functions: a technical and management function and a consultative and decision-making function. These two decentralized functions should be linked to a national organization with the function of:
* monitoring and prompting the reply of national services to requests, initiatives and suggestions from local and regional levels;
* ensuring the coordination and coherence of interventions and decisions at national level with those at regional level; and
* providing research and other consistent support to the programme, such as coordination research, complementarily, and continuity of financial support.
Lastly, the principle of duration and flexibility of assistance to activities is obvious in rural development and desertification control. The duration requirement means that governments and donors need to affirm their support on a long-term basis and implement it in financial phases that match national planning cycles if they exist. The flexibility requirement has two aspects:
* flexibility of technical assistance to communities, adapting it to the needs, length and equipment necessary for the action programmes; and
* financial and accounting flexibility, particularly the unscheduled financing of positive requests and initiatives from local communities.
When all is said and done, the global and participatory approach is only one step away from becoming a code of practice. Its primary goal is to promote popular participation. Its keywords are integration, consultation, spatial management, decentralization of adapted organization, and duration and flexibility of technical and financial assistance. Activities in numerous developing countries over the last 15 years have confirmed the validity of the approach, but how is it to be applied?
Strategic objectives and components
According to the definition of sustainable agricultural and rural development approved by the FAO Council in 1988:
"Sustainable development is the management and conservation of the resource base, and the orientation of technological and institutional change in such a manner as to ensure the attainment and continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generations. Such sustainable development (in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors) conserves land, water, plant and animal genetic resources, is environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable."
More specific to the strategic objective of combating desertification, the sustainable development of arid, semiarid and dry subhumid zones must confront three challenges:
* using preventive measures, to check or prevent desertification of land slightly or not yet degraded;
* to regenerate, through corrective measures, the productivity of moderately degraded land;
* to restore the productivity of seriously degraded land, using rehabilitation and repair measures.
Although the situations and degree of seriousness vary substantially between countries, it seems (according to data currently available) fortunate that land in the "seriously degraded" category is limited in area; it is essentially grazing land, for which the cause of degradation is unclear, raising the questions whether desertification is caused by human activity or whether loss of productivity and erosion are caused by climatic changes. Consequently, FAO considers that lands in the first two categories in the paragraph above, where the majority of people affected by desertification live, should be the subject of special attention and given priority. Actions to rehabilitate seriously degraded land should be limited to specific cases where the causes of land degradation have been clearly identified and rehabilitation and repair measures have been judged suitable, effective and sustainable.
As human activity is the reason for degradation in most cases, it is absolutely essential to question the general policies that allow and sometimes cause these actions. The fight against desertification is political as well as technological. In order to be effective, it is necessary to revise current development policies and incorporate the idea of sustainability, established at UNCED as a basic principle in future development activity.
The April 1991 FAO/Netherlands Conference on Agriculture and Environment (known as the "Den Bosch" Conference, since it was held in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands) took this position and concluded that rural sustainable development policies should aim at operating so that agricultural and rural sectors:
* meet the basic nutritional needs of present and future generations;
* supply rural people with long-term employment, adequate income and decent living and working conditions;
* maintain, if necessary after rehabilitation, the productive capacity of natural resources; and
* mitigate the agricultural sector's vulnerability to hostile natural and socio-economic factors and other hazards.
These objectives may be considered universal - they are in fact repeated in another form in Chapter 14 of Agenda 21 on sustainable agriculture - and are particularly applicable to territories and countries affected or threatened by drought and desertification.
To be implemented in practice, these objectives presuppose a strong political commitment in favour of translating them into a strategy, as well as concrete actions that will provide rural peoples with a judicial, legislative and socio-economic context conducive to developing their sustainable development initiatives along the principles of a global and participatory approach. This political commitment should itself be based on a favourable international context, which could be facilitated by the finalization of a world convention on desertification following adoption of the texts of UNCED.
Nationally, only a suitable general policy framework will enable rural people to articulate fully their initiatives and provide them with the elements of sustainability. The general political and economic situation should encourage equity and sustainable development by allowing individuals to express choices while giving them the chance to defend their interests. A demographic policy, as appropriate to each country, should aim at a viable growth rate and fix goals for an optimal number of inhabitants. A human settlements policy is also necessary in most countries in order to strike a fair balance between rural and urban populations. Production, processing and marketing, as well as arbitration between these sectors, should be managed equitably.
Internationally, it is necessary to ease the negative effects of debt and international trade arrangements on the capacity of developing countries' governments to lead their country to a sustainable balance. International collaboration is necessary in the management of shared resources and access to technology. International financial and technical assistance should he oriented towards sustainable development; aid distribution should not be determined by the immediate economic benefits for current generations.
There are two main strategic components of action for the sustainable development of arid areas and for combating desertification.
International components
* developed countries should take measures to reduce the excessive burden of debt on developing countries and to check deteriorating rates of exchange;
* developed countries should improve international economic relations so as to increase and maintain farmers' income, thereby creating incentives for appropriate investment in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones threatened or affected by desertification;
* the international community should supply the financial and technical aid necessary to help poor developing countries implement their strategies for the sustainable development of arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones in rural areas threatened or affected by desertification;
* the international community- and international, regional and subregional organizations in particular should be mobilized in order to organize effectively the gathering, analysis and distribution of data from the continuing observation and forecasting of drought and desertification phenomena;
* the international scientific community should pool its experience in continuing studies of desertification processes and in perfecting techniques to combat these processes.
National components
o governments should recognize that rural people play a vital role in food security and in preserving the renewable natural resource base. For most countries, this would mean allocating adequate financial resources, pricing policies, the decentralization of institutions, and the delegation of authority to rural people, particularly poor people and women;
o governments should facilitate access to education and training, technologies and suitable resources for farmers and pastoralists, particularly small-scale farmers and the very poor;
o in many countries, governments should implement the far-reaching changes and adjustments necessary to generate conditions of sustainability. In particular, the eradication of poverty should be a main component, with the aim of establishing sustainable development in densely populated rural areas and in marginal land inhabited by small-scale farmers and landless workers;
o demographic policies should be applied to increase the possibility of instituting long-term prospects of sustainable development in arid areas. According to circumstances, these policies should cover family planning and population migration from less favourable areas towards potentially more productive areas at lower risk;
o policies of equal land access and recognition of the rights of those living and managing it, both to protect and make the land productive, should be implemented to allow rural people to assume responsibility;
o policies for developing rural service centres should be undertaken so that rural people have available:
* facilities for transport, storage and marketing of agricultural products;
* access to supply sources for seeds, pesticides, medicines, etc.;
* access to rural credit;
* access to technologies adapted to the needs of preserving and rehabilitating land productivity and the diversification of plant and animal production;
* facilities for developing craft industries and appropriate micro-industries, particularly by allowing access to renewable energy sources;
o land management and planning policies should be implemented so as to develop global outlines, incorporating vulnerability and risk as essential components of planning decisions;
o policies of agricultural diversification and development of different activities, sources of income and food, such as fisheries and aquaculture, apiculture and processing of forestry products, should be pursued thoroughly.
Operational implementation
The whole problem in implementation is the bringing about of real synergy between the aspirations and wishes of rural people and the decisions and commitments of the government and its administration. It is neither a question of giving all the authority and means to rural people nor of deciding and implementing everything for them. The global and participatory approach can only bear fruit if governments' political strategies follow the broad outlines of the previous paragraph. Similarly, the strategic components in combating desertification will only be effective locally if a global and participatory approach is adopted, facilitated and maintained in practice at the basic community level.
There is no immediate and ideal approach for every situation and constraint. Each country and each community should be able to find the best way to proceed in the suggested direction. By analysing the conditions of its emergence and its application in various examples, it can be seen that this approach can assume different forms - from the most pragmatic to the most stylized, from the most open to the most programmed; the form being determined by each situation and the people involved. The main objective of such a strategy is to promote coordination and consultation between partners through a progressive management protocol, respecting an underlying principle of popular participation. The strategy should be effected by a programme of consultation and coordination, management and programming, and promotion of popular participation. Each programme component should combine the contribution of all partners, who will need to assume their individual responsibilities fully.
The territorial approach (the living area of a rural community being identified - but not exclusively - with a village's land) is important in sustainable development and in combating desertification. It offers a geographical setting where the dynamic relationships between local desertification factors can be faced in a coordinated and programmed way. This framework may be split into micro-catchment or cropping areas, providing a small but nevertheless significant sample that could be used as a starting-point for work on a total-territory basis. Conversely, this framework may be expanded to incorporate the physical, particularly hydrographic, factors at work on the lands of several communities. The territorial approach also supplies a socio-economic setting, that of the community with knowledge and authority over its land. It is within this socio-economic setting, often steeped in cultural values, that the community can be organized and can defend and manage the
rehabilitation of the productive natural resources of its land. This setting also makes it easier to understand the place and role of the community's various components, especially women and children, and to support their promotion and needs.
Having recognized that rural communities have the capacity to organize the sustainable management of their own territory, this should be supported, and neither denied nor diverted by development projects and services. Such assistance is needed to introduce and to help implement proposals appropriate to the technical capability of the local population. It is also needed to provide information and training in order to promote the community's capacity to conceive, organize, manage and decide its own activity. Finally, such assistance can supply material support when counteracting land degradation requires equipment, materials and efforts beyond the financial and physical means of the community. The decentralized and devolved technical services of the administration and other bodies concerned should thus be able to intervene to help local populations.

FAO's responsibilities and contributions to the fight against desertification
Past activities (1977-1992)
UNCED preparation and FAO follow-up
Past activities (1977-1992)
Evaluation and monitoring of desertification and drought processes
One of FAO's basic functions is to collect and interpret global information on all aspects of the food, agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors. In zones affected by desertification, these activities are particularly concerned with the natural resources used by the various sectors, their potential and vulnerability and their state of degradation or conservation. Also covered are the social and economic conditions, especially nutrition, linked to the use of these natural resources by the various sectors.
For the 1977 World Conference, FAO and Unesco prepared a world map of desertification to a scale of 1:250 000. Later, in 1979, in response to requests for more precise data on desertification and its evolution, FAO and UNEP developed a methodology for evaluating and mapping desertification which enabled a world map of desertification risk to be drawn up.
In collaboration with UNEP and Unesco, FAO also developed a methodology for mapping land degradation. Regional maps were prepared for sub-Saharan Africa and for the Near East region.
In cooperation with UNEP, FAO has distributed monitoring and evaluation reports on the evolution of pastoral ecosystems and has implemented several ecological monitoring projects in various parts of the world, including the Sahel, eastern Africa, West Africa, the Near East, and the Indian subcontinent.
The Forest Resources Assessment Programme has set up a database on the state of wood resources and is currently producing, using remote sensing techniques, a statistical assessment of deforestation and plant cover degradation, especially in areas affected by drought and desertification.
FAO's Remote Sensing Centre, through its many field projects and its ARTEMIS project (African Real Time Environmental Monitoring using Imaging Satellites), obtains and regularly processes satellite data, providing information on land use and the principal climatic and ecological parameters affecting agriculture. This information, together with the databases of agricultural and agrometeorological statistics and agronomic and socio-economic data gathered in the field, is used by FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System for Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) for crop assessments and harvest forecasts. The maps and geographical databases prepared by the Remote Sensing Centre from satellite pictures are also used by technical services to draw up and assess development projects.
These information-gathering and analysing activities also cover documentation of national policies, legislation and institutions and documentation on food, agriculture, forestry and fishery technologies, including desertification and drought problems. This work is not carried out just at world and regional levels, but also in the context of many technical assistance missions and projects at the national level. The information obtained is used on a regular basis to provide FAO Member Nations with the means to examine the food and agricultural situation and their relevant policies and projects.
Support to action programmes
For several decades, at the request of its Member Nations and with various sources of expertise and financing, FAO has supplied technical advice on and assistance with various aspects of the agricultural improvement and rural development of arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones ravaged by drought and desertification. These activities involved emergency and rehabilitation actions in the event of drought or other agricultural disasters, such as locust invasions; support in the formulation of policies and plans for development in the food, agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors; development of human resources particularly for rural women - and of national institutions and legislation; and the promotion of research and dissemination of appropriate technologies in the various sectors.
These efforts have mostly taken the form of technical assistance projects in answer to specific requests by Member Nations. They are also sometimes undertaken within programmes that group together projects with common priorities, such as the programme to relaunch African agriculture (involving 200 projects in 30 countries); the "fertilizer", "seed", "prevention of postharvest losses" and "food security" programmes; the action plan of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (WCARRD); the Tropical Forestry Action Plan; and many others. Numerous desertification control and drought control activities were implemented under these plans and projects, especially for soil conservation, pasture improvement, livestock improvement, small-scale irrigation, cereal storage, agroforestry, development of fuelwood resources, and also for nutrition improvement.
In all these sectors, FAO has obtained positive technical results and accumulated considerable experience. This experience has been disseminated throughout the world - as much to technicians as to decision-makers - through numerous publications on agriculture, plant production, animal production, forestry, fisheries, land and water improvement, food and nutrition, legislation, and economic and social development. Some of these activities deserve particular mention.
Land and water management. FAO projects are often multidisciplinary in this field, integrating land assessment, agroclimatic and agro-ecological studies, catchment area management, rehabilitation of degraded land, soil conservation, and natural resource assessment.
At the local level, numerous studies have been undertaken on agricultural systems, pasture and rangeland management, subsistence production, shifting cultivation and irrigated agriculture, taking into account the social, economic, legislative and institutional conditions of each country.
At its Twenty-first Session, the FAO Conference approved a World Soil Charter, proposing a set of principles for the optimal sustainable use of world land and water resources, improvement of their productivity, and conservation for future generations.
Soil and water conservation. Few FAO projects approach this problem in an isolated way. They all emphasize the link between the sustainable and optimal use of soils and water and increased agricultural production, improving rural people's living standards and stabilizing the economy. Projects cover a broad range of topics: soil assessment and mapping, management of catchment areas and watersheds, soil rehabilitation and defence, surface water conservation work, training, institutional support, legislation studies and advice to governments.
Although most projects are national in scope, many projects also have a regional importance, such as the Regional Soil Conservation Project in Africa, which finished in 1985, or the project to combat the degradation of the Fouta Djalon massif - the source of most large West African rivers.
Finally, after the publication in 1986 of the study African agriculture: the next 25 years, FAO confronted the serious problem of land degradation in Africa. With the help of African experts, FAO prepared the International Scheme for the Conservation and Rehabilitation of African l ends programme (1990), which has just started to be implemented.
Assessment of soil fertility. Among the many projects conducted by FAO, mention should be made of the study undertaken with the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) on assessing the potential population-supporting capacity of lands in the developing world. The study, which covered 117 developing countries, compared soil and climate data with the requirements of the 15 most important subsistence crops and grassland pasture' and determined the critical thresholds of population density.
Irrigation. FAO has implemented a whole range of projects for the control and prevention of degradation of arid and semi-arid soils as a result of inappropriate irrigation measures. Technical implementation has been accompanied by analyses of the economic efficiency of drainage and salinity control. Furthermore, FAO has regularly worked with the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS) in analysing the problems of salinization and alkalinization of badly drained and irrigated soils, and also in developing prevention and rehabilitation techniques.
In 1980, FAO set up an international programme for the management of irrigation water in order to apply the recommendations of WCARRD from 1979. This programme has helped many countries and organized numerous seminars and training workshops.
Integrated management of rangelands and animal production. FAO and UNEP developed the International Cooperative Programme on the Ecological Management of Arid and Semi-Arid Rangelands in Africa, the Near East and Middle East (EMASAR) in various countries in northern Africa and western Asia. This demonstration programme has supported the training of numerous technicians and the development of water-use techniques and agriculture-livestock associations.
In the Sahelian zone, a regional project covering Burkina Faso, the Niger and Mali also confronted the problem of integrating agriculture and livestock production near forage areas. In other regions, FAO has implemented projects to improve pastoral management to combat erosion and to increase productivity, such as in the Himalayan countries (Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan), and in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
In animal production, FAO helps many countries in arid and semi-arid zones to plan veterinary strategies, by framing legislation and planning infrastructure, financial mechanisms and information services.
Finally, sheep and goats are particularly important in the economy of arid zones for the production of milk, cheese and meat; several FAO studies and projects have developed strategies for the introduction, improvement and management of these animals.
Management of wood resources and reforestation. The various FAO Regional Commissions on Forestry, and the FAO Committee on Forestry have given particular emphasis to the role of forestry in controlling desertification. Various meetings and workshops particularly the Saltillo Expert Consultation in Mexico in 1985 - have studied and assessed the impact of forestry action and enabled the appropriate technologies to be widely distributed. Numerous field projects have allowed the concrete implementation and testing of these techniques relating to: the management and use of existing wood resources (inventories, planning, silviculture, product use) in interaction with agriculture and rangeland (agrosylvipastoral management systems);
* the creation of new wood resources, pasture and different products by either individual or communal reforestation efforts;
* the introduction of trees into agrarian systems, leading to an agroforestry arrangement;
* the management of wildlife and use of game meat;
* the processing of forestry products - oils, resins, tannins, rubber, fibres, timber, leaves, fruit, etc.;
* the use of trees in controlling soil degradation and restoring fertility, and in combating wind and water erosion; and
* the use of wood as an energy source.
Several action programmes have ensured the consistency and integration of these projects into national development strategies. These include the Communal Forestry Development Programmer the Rural Development Forestry Programme; the Special Action Programme for Forestry and Rural Energy; the Forests, Trees, and People Action Programmer and finally the Tropical Forestry Action Plan - a conceptual framework for planning and developing forestry action in the global context of rural, economic and social development.
In addition to this field activity should be noted all the studies and research undertaken in many spheres by the FAO Forestry Department, including forest management, reforestation, breeding, conservation of genetic resources, forestry in arid areas, wildlife management, fuelwood, silviculture of natural forests and plantations, agroforestry, sand dune stabilization, windbreaks, forestry legislation, processing and economics of forest products.
Food security. The seriousness of the world food crisis and the consequences of the 1974 World Food Conference resulted in FAO becoming involved with activities in the realm of food security. FAO set up GIEWS so as to provide both a continuous flow of reliable and updated information on basic food availability and an international system that is able to warn of impending food shortages in good time.
FAO activities in supporting food security also include the Food Security Assistance Scheme (FSAS) cleated in 1976 to help developing countries structure their national food policies, and implement projects to create and manage infrastructure for food storage and improving national early warning systems.
Lastly, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), created in 1974 in the wake of the World Food Conference, drew up an FAO Action Plan for World Food Security in 1979 and subsequently, in 1985, adopted a World Food Security Compact.
The organization by FAO of WCARRD in 1979 is also noteworthy. This conference called for particular efforts to reach poor rural people and promote their participation in the formulation and implementation of rural development programmes. FAO's projects on basic resource development and agriculture aim to involve the smallest-scale producers everywhere by mobilizing them in local organizations, groups, cooperatives, etc.
WCARRD also encouraged the promotion of good land management and at least access to, if not ownership of, available cropland. A guarantee of longterm use or ownership can effectively change the producer's behaviour in managing land and combating its degradation.
It is within this context that FAO is strengthening its operational programme to support the objectives of food security. The principal activities are:
* promoting sustainable food production;
* improving storage and processing at the household level;
* strengthening marketing institutions;
* improving disaster prevention and relief;
* direct support in the field; and
* strengthening food security institutions.
Activities to ensure adequate food supplies tend to promote sustainable food production. They focus on the management and conservation of natural resources, tree cultivation, plant and animal production, fisheries and appropriate technology. Programmes in this field enhance food production while also providing adequate safeguards against soil and environmental degradation.
Energy for sustainable development. One of the major reasons for the degradation of wooded areas in arid zones is their overexploitation for fuelwood, particularly for urban use. Action programmes in the energy sector therefore aim at easing pressure on natural wood resources.
FAO's approach to rural energy problems takes account of the peculiarities of the rural sector, namely energy use on a small scale, lack of systematic management and the institutional infrastructure. FAO's activities aim at developing technologies, formulating strategies and promoting field activities to improve energy management and investment decisions in this sector in order to bring about rational ecological development. FAO has promoted programmes to make more efficient use of wood energy, agricultural waste, biogas and solar energy, and has prompted networks for the exchange of experiences and technology transfer, such as on wood energy, gas production from rice husks, etc. Training activities and publications complement these field programmes.
Nevertheless, as the use of wood as a domestic energy source is dominant, many programmes attempt to reduce its use by promoting improved wood-burning stoves that are more energy-efficient, and by developing new resources, such as individual or communal multipurpose plantations for fuelwood and other uses.
UNCED preparation and FAO follow-up
Preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development gave FAO the opportunity to re-examine its policies and restructure its programmes taking into account experience gained in the field. The high point of this reappraisal was the 1991 FAO/Netherlands Conference on Agriculture and Environment - the Den Bosch Conference. This conference enabled the policy-making bodies of FAO to define the guiding principles and the general activities of an International Cooperative Programme Framework for Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (ICPF/SARD), particularly addressing the priorities of arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid regions affected by desertification and drought.
The programme framework addresses three strategic demands for development in these zones:
* greater efficiency in the use of limited resources in order to fulfil the essential needs of the populations and improve their standard of living;
* reducing the risks of and vulnerability to climatic hazards and other disasters, especially to ensure food security; and
* conserving natural resources and protecting the environment.
ICPF/SARD was developed by FAO during its active involvement in drawing up the chapters of Agenda 21 on the same topics. As a consequence, recommendations from UNCED - on agriculture and sustainable development, forestry, combating desertification, and water and fisheries management coincide to a marked degree with the structure and objectives of the ICPF/SARD programmes.
As ICPF/SARD received the unanimous support of the FAO Council in November 1992, the Organization is therefore ready to contribute actively within its spheres of competence to the UNCED follow-up on combating drought and desertification by sustainable rural development in arid, semi-arid and subhumid dry zones.

International cooperative programme framework for sustainable agriculture and rural development (ICPF/SARD)
Creation of a general policy framework
Action plan: areas for concentrating efforts
Creation of a general policy framework
The general strategy proposed for ICPF/SARD rests on two main points:
* increasing a population's options so that they do not need to undermine their environment; and
* creating the necessary conditions for the market to operate efficiently while anticipating adequate corrective measures if the market is unable to ensure viable management of natural resources.
The strategy comprises three basic objectives:
* food security by ensuring an appropriate and sustainable balance between self-sufficiency and self-reliance;
* employment and income generation in rural areas; and
* natural resource conservation (water, soil and vegetation) and environmental protection.
In arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones, the particular position of farmers at the quasi-subsistence level calls for the following options:
o decentralization by devolving more responsibility to local level and by encouraging communities to take the initiative instead of relying on autocratic administration;
o granting clearly defined rights concerning resource use;
o easing pressure on natural resources by undertaking work to improve, rehabilitate and conserve resources in order to be able to use them more productively, such as:
* encouraging demand for products that can be obtained using viable methods;
* improving the land: population relationship through agrarian reform; and
* encouraging transmigration where it is possible and desirable; and
o applying technologies that meet the need for sustainability, in order to ease pressure in areas where the population is particularly high, by:
* supplying technology packages for the whole farming system instead of tackling each problem separately; and
* searching for solutions based on good practices and expertise rather than external inputs and mechanization.
Action plan: areas for concentrating efforts
The action plan has a number of elements.
Sectorial and subsectorial analysis and policy advice. This is the uppermost level, where the results of the whole agricultural sector or subsector analyses are refined into a set of policy parameters for consideration by national decision-makers. Such advisory work takes into account existing or planned national development strategies, together with available or potential resources, and identifies gaps in these national strategies in order to make them sufficiently comprehensive to deliver the desired benefits.
Planning and programming assistance. Within the whole range of FAO activities in this field, three areas of critical importance are identified:
* food security and nutrition;
* national forestry action programmes; and
* responsible and sustainable fisheries.
Integrated rural development. This has two major levels:
* community level (people's participation and human resources development); and
* household level.
Conservation and rational use of critical natural resources for sustainable development. This includes land, water, and plant and animal genetic resources.
Safe use of key inputs and technologies. This addresses essentially two areas:
* pest control; and
* maintenance of soil fertility.
This action plan, approved by the Hundred-andSecond Session of the FAO Council in November 1992, will be implemented through the activities of Special Action Programmes (SAPs) currently being restructured by FAO.
On first analysis, the SAPs would be the following:
* a sectorial and structural adjustment programme grouping a number of activities in policy analysis and advisory services;
* a food security and improved nutrition programme to cover activities related to nutrition problems;
* the recently revamped Tropical Forestry Action Plan, with a possible extension to other types of forest;
* a fisheries and aquaculture programme based on elements of the strategy developed by the World Conference on Fisheries Management and Development;
* a human resources development programme which would encompass the human resources aspects of the following programmes Plan of Action on People's Participation; Women in Development; Forest, Trees and People; and Artisanal Fisheries;
* a sustainable household farming systems programme, including ongoing projects on farm management and on diversification of farming systems;
* an integrated plant nutrition systems programme, incorporating the Fertilizer Programme and current related projects;
* a pest control programme; and
* the International Action Programme on Water and Sustainable Agricultural Development (IAPWASAD), which includes an important section on managing water resources in drylands.
One of the main objectives in grouping activities under a Special Action Programme is to enable FAO to use its capabilities fully and to attract sufficient funding for maximum impact. Such an arrangement also meets the increased coherence called for by the donor community; donors prefer to work with a programme approach rather than disconnected ad hoc projects. This should catalyse financial support for the programmes.
Finally, the emergence of ICPF/SARD and the related SAPs undoubtedly contributes to giving them a clear identity and will encourage the interagency cooperation and coordination that FAO is actively seeking.

Annex
Chapter 12 of Agenda 21: analysis and comments
MANAGING FRAGILE ECOSYSTEMS: COMBATING DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT
Programme Area A
Strengthening the knowledge base and developing information and monitoring systems for regions prone to desertification and drought, including the economic and social aspects of these ecosystems.
The "basis for action" in this programme area states: "Adequate worldwide systematic observation systems are helpful for the development and implementation of effective anti-desertification programmes.... An integrated and coordinated information and systematic observation system based on appropriate technology and embracing global, regional, national and local levels is essential for understanding the dynamics of desertification and drought processes."
FAO endorses this statement because assessments of the state and evolution of desertification have revealed gaps in the knowledge of the geographical extent of the processes and their evolution. FAO, therefore, considers that strengthening the activities of the international community end governments is necessary without delaying the implementation of concrete action at national and local levels. In most countries, there is enough knowledge concerning the spread of desertification and its mechanisms to operate effectively.
Consequently, FAO believes that improvements should address data acquisition systems as well as analysis and communication methods and the final products, and that it is necessary to strengthen the effectiveness of regional and national centres in responding to genuine user needs.
In this respect, it is useful to consider the basis for action, objectives and actions mentioned in Programme Area D, Chapter 11 of Agenda 21, devoted to forests, which covers:
"Establishing and/or strengthening capacities for the planning, assessment and systematic observations of forests."
The disappearance of forest trees is often one of the most visible consequences of desertification, as well as being one of the determining and exacerbating factors. At the same time, desertification is an evolutionary and complex process. It is the result of several factors, having implications for all areas, including human behaviour, and brings about chain reactions affecting all elements of the ecosystem. Thus, FAO considers that research should be carried out to clarify this complexity and identify its mechanisms.
FAO believes that these information needs are greatest and most urgent at the national and local levels. FAO supports the strengthening and creation of national centres for the study and observation of terrestrial resources such as remote sensing and ecological monitoring centres; these will be able to monitor rainfall and land degradation continuously, and transmit information in map or database format by using remote sensing and GIS technology.
FAO will also support the establishment at subregional and, particularly, national levels of geographic information systems. These systems can coherently standardize, integrate and disseminate the main physical and economic indicators of interest to the managers and decision-makers responsible for sustainable agricultural development.
Programme Area B
Combating land degradation through, inter alia, intensified soil conservation, afforestation and reforestation activities.
The "basis for action" of this programme area includes the statement "In combating desertification on rangeland, rainfed cropland and irrigated land, preventive measures should be launched in areas which are not yet affected or are only slightly affected by desertification; corrective measures should be implemented to sustain the productivity of moderately decertified land; and rehabilitative measures should be taken to recover severely or very severely decertified drylands."
FAO considers that these actions are, in fact, indispensable to maintaining and restoring soil productivity. For sustainable development, it is necessary to conserve water and land and to use technologies that do not threaten the sustainability of natural resources. Unfortunately, efforts to halt land degradation have so far had limited success, especially in developing countries. Land degradation is serious, because low productivity coincides in many countries with a rapid population increase, and hence an increased demand for food, fibre and fuel.
For FAO, combating land degradation should not be limited to technical action. The fight against land degradation can only be successful if development policies are revised and long-term land-use strategies are adopted with strong political support and adequate financial resources.
In this context, it is appropriate to consider the principles, objectives and actions mentioned in Programme Area E, Chapter 14 of Agenda 21, which deals with land conservation and rehabilitation.
The presence of trees is often an essential factor in maintaining soil structure and fertility as well as offering protection from wind and water erosion. Once again it is advisable to consider the "basis for action", objectives and actions stated in the various programme areas of Chapter 11 of Agenda 21 on trees and forests, particularly Programme Area A on sustaining the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests, forest lands and woodlands, and Programme Area B on enhancing the protection, sustainable management and conservation of all forests, and the greening of degraded areas, through forest rehabilitation, afforestation, reforestation and other rehabilitative processes.
The territorial approach (the living area of a rural community being identified - but not exclusively - with a village's land) is necessary for the actual implementation of actions for land and water conservation, rehabilitation and sustainable management of rangeland and reforestation. This geographic, social and economic framework is effectively the best adapted to lead the global action needed on the ground - and not the sectorial activities that have so often been doomed to failure - implying the full participation of local people, both at the project identification and at the implementation phases. However, it is important to note that certain measures for correcting land degradation require equipment, materials and efforts beyond the financial and physical resources of local people. In such cases, the decentralized technical services of the administration and other relevant bodies should be able to intervene to help the local populations.
Programme Area C
Developing and strengthening integrated development programmes for the eradication of poverty and promotion of alternative livelihood systems in areas prone to desertification.
The "basis for action" of this programme area states: "In areas prone to desertification and drought, current livelihood and resource-use systems are not able to maintain living standards.... Poverty is a major factor in accelerating the rate of degradation and desertification. "
FAO considers that this observation - which is applicable to many developing countries - is essential for orienting activities efficiently. The survival mechanisms of the populations living in increasing numbers in zones with hazardous climatic conditions lead to overexploitation of natural resources (soil, water, vegetation) and a deterioration in living conditions. The consequences are therefore extremely serious and often dramatic for the poorest people in developing countries.
For FAO, desertification control can only be successful if the social, economic, cultural and political development policies adopted aim principally at solving problems brought about by poverty in the areas of food supply, accommodation, employment, income, health, education and population pressure. In this respect, it is relevant to bear in mind the "basis for action", objectives and activities mentioned in the numerous Programme Areas of Chapter 14 of Agenda 21, including:
C. Improving farm production and farming systems through diversification of farm and non-farm employment and infrastructure development.
D. Land-resource planning, information and education for agriculture.
F. Water for sustainable food production and sustainable rural development.
G. Conservation and sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for food and sustainable agriculture.
H. Conservation and sustainable utilization of animal genetic resources for sustainable agriculture.
J. Sustainable plant nutrition to increase food production.
K. Rural energy transition to enhance productivity.
Similarly, it is necessary to take into account the "basis for action", objectives and action mentioned in Programme Area C, Chapter 11 of Agenda 21, concerning "promoting efficient utilization and assessment to recover the full valuation of the goods and services provided by forests, forest lands and woodlands".
The development and strengthening of an integrated approach to rural development should therefore be translated into strategic elements aimed at:
* satisfying all the basic nutritional requirements of present and future generations;
* supplying rural peoples with sustainable employment, sufficient income and decent working and living conditions;
* maintaining, if necessary after rehabilitation, the productive capacity of natural resources; and
* reducing the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to hostile natural or socio-economic factors, or other risks.
FAO believes that only a strong political commitment will allow the application of these strategic elements and the implementation of the far-reaching changes and adjustments necessary to place rural people in a judicial, legislative, social and economic context conducive to the implementation of their own development initiatives on a sustainable basis. This political commitment itself must rely on a favourable international environment based on improved international economic relations and improved relations between nations, conducive to increasing and maintaining farmers' incomes, and thus creating incentives for substantial investments in arid zones threatened or affected by desertification.
Programme Area D
Developing comprehensive anti-desertification programmes and integrating them into national development plans and national environmental planning.
The "basis for action" for this programme area states: "The social systems interacting with land resources make the problem much more complex, requiring an integrated approach to the planning and management of land resources. Action plans to combat desertification and drought should include management aspects of the environment and development, thus conforming with the approach of integrating national development plans and national environmental action plans."
FAO considers that this statement is fundamental to the success of any activity. By analysing the underlying causes of desertification it is possible to state that human activities, major reasons for degradation of vulnerable land, are induced by two distinct categories of factors: those resulting from poverty and lack of resources (human, technological, institutional and financial), and those arising from "modern" development that is insufficiently sensitive to the impact of its technologies on land sustainability.
FAO considers, therefore, that it is within the framework of an integrated and sustainable rural development policy that desertification can best be combated. This necessitates a review of agricultural development policies and planning, as suggested in Programme Area A, Chapter 14 of Agenda 21, on promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development, and on agricultural policy review, planning and integrated programmes in the light of the multifunctional aspect of agriculture, particularly with regard to food security and sustainable development.
The integration of anti-desertification programmes should therefore be implemented at the national level in the framework of policy formulation and strategic planning for integrated and sustainable rural development.
FAO believes that the required strengthening of institutional capacities should take account of this integration and aim at strengthening existing structures and institutions in the rural sector (agriculture, forestry, animal production, etc.) rather than supporting the establishment of new institutions and structures.
These structures and institutions should be coordinated at the national level through a single, integrated and sustainable rural development plan. To facilitate dialogue and collaboration with people at the local level, it may be advisable in many instances to install generalist development workers, relying on the various specialized technical services that are decentralized to the administrative areas.
Programme Area E
Developing comprehensive drought preparedness and drought-relief schemes, including self-help arrangements, for drought-prone areas and designing programmes to cope with environmental refugees.
The "basis for action" states that: "Early-warning systems to forecast drought will make possible the implementation of drought-preparedness schemes. Integrated packages at the farm and watershed level, such as alternative cropping strategies, soil and water conservation and promotion of water harvesting techniques, could enhance the capacity of land to cope with drought and provide basic necessities, thereby minimizing the number of environmental refugees and the need for emergency drought relief."
FAO endorses this double response to famine. Desertification and drought are responsible for the loss of many human lives and for dire economic consequences in countries directly affected. Emergency action, which is a duty of assistance and of national and international solidarity, cannot be improvised; it should be designed not just to be immediately effective, but also not to jeopardize long-term self-subsistence efforts by the populations affected. Such efforts should be encouraged and supported so that production systems are less exposed to climatic hazards and are more diversified and productive.
For FAO, food security is one of the basic objectives of sustainable rural and agricultural development policy, especially in the arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones.
The need to solve urgent problems should not obscure the need to implement a whole series of measures to guarantee medium- and long-term food security for rural and urban people in these zones. These measures do not affect agricultural and livestock production alone, but also affect other food-producing sectors such as fisheries and aquaculture, or sources of monetary income such as the artisanal industries and on-site processing of agricultural, animal and forestry products for manufacturing marketable goods (flour, oil, butter, cheese, fruit, charcoal, etc.).
The access to land, or at least to the availability of agricultural land, should also be encouraged. Guaranteeing long-term use or ownership actually enhances short- and long-term food security, as it may alter the producer's approach to managing the lands being worked and encourage the combating of land degradation.
Programme Area F
Encouraging and promoting popular participation and environmental education, focusing on desertification control and management of the effects of drought.
The "basis for action" for this programme area states: "But it is necessary to go beyond the theoretical idea of popular participation and to focus on obtaining actual active popular involvement, rooted in the concept of partnership. This implies the sharing of responsibilities and the mutual involvement of all parties. In this context, this programme area should be considered an essential supporting component of all desertification control and drought-related activities."
FAO believes that this basis for action is vitally important because the desertification problem centres around the rural population, either as protagonists or victims. Desertification control and development activities aim at implementing technical proposals to help prevent or correct environmental degradation and increase and diversify production. The term "proposal" suggests that they are subject to popular approval: first, during programme formulation, in which the people will need to take part; and, second, during implementation, where their agreement will be demonstrated by the people themselves using the suggested techniques. The people are a partner whose actions will determine the success or failure of the work.
For FAO, the main guiding principle in sustainable development and combating desertification is the promotion of voluntary and responsible popular participation through measures that are:
* legislative (rights and duties linked to the use of land, water and trees; access to property and usufruct, association and organizational rights);
* economic (workings of the markets, price, access to credit and the means of production, transport and storage infrastructure);
* social (access to education and training, improved public health, support for strengthening the internal management capacity of rural organizations, sensitizing the population to the potential role of popular organizations, particularly peasant groups, livestock groups, women, young people, the indigenous populations, and local communities);
* institutional (decentralization, creation of support centres for rural services).
In this context, it is useful to review the basis for action, objectives and activities of Programme Area B. Chapter 14 of Agenda 21, on ensuring people's participation and promoting human resource development for sustainable agriculture.
FAO believes that the aim of popular organization should be to structure and widen its potential for community development.
To achieve this goal, the people should ensure that there is:
* internal distribution of information and self-training;
* self-management of collective activities and work; and
* socio-political promotion of the community by assuming responsibility for managing its area.
FAO considers that differing social and cultural situations require each rural organization to be built upon the community's established socio-cultural base. This does not exclude introducing new elements to satisfy evolving needs.
The main task of governments is to give power to the people in charge of such organizations so that they can represent their organization as full partners of those wishing to assist them.
There is an obvious functional and political connection between the voluntary and responsible participation of the population in combating desertification and the national institutions that are responsible for regulation and encouragement. The concrete result of this impetus is assistance services to development as they are the implementational arm of institutions and the main support of the people. These institutions should be decentralized and devolved to work in partnership with the people.

Glossary of phytosanitary terms
Introduction
Phytosanitary terms and definitions
Introduction
Scope
This reference standard presents a list of terms and definitions with specific meaning to plant quarantine personnel worldwide. It has been developed to provide an internationally recognized vocabulary for construction and implementation of phytosanitary measures so as to facilitate communication between trading parties.

Outline of reference
This first revision of the Glossary supersedes the list originated as the "FAO Glossary of Phytosanitary Terms" published in English, French and Spanish (FAO, 1990). It includes phytosanitary terminology compiled and periodically reviewed by an international group of plant quarantine experts, with assistance provided by the Regional Plant Protection Organizations. This list has been prepared to assist National Plant Protection Organizations in information exchange on phytosanitary issues and in their harmonization of wording in official plant quarantine documents.
The new Glossary has been expanded to include the list in Arabic and Chinese as well, and is accompanied by a multilingual index cross-referencing all terms. A number of terms have been revised to improve technical and language clarity. Terms not found in this list may have been deleted as no longer needing a specialized description, or may still lack agreement internationally over their general meaning. Others may be so new that common definitions have yet to be developed.
Every attempt has been made to keep definitions simple and ensure consistency of language usage within the Glossary. Many words are already well accepted in agricultural trade. Core vocabulary terms are printed in bold and defined in relation to one another to avoid unnecessary repetition of elements described elsewhere. For example, "plants" includes "parts of so "parts of is not repeated. "Area" is "officially" defined, so it is not specified as such again.
It is hoped that new terms introduced in this revision will receive equivalent wide acceptance. As phytosanitary science develops further, additional terminology will be adopted and incorporated into future editions of the Glossary.

Glossaire des termes phytosanitaires
Introduction
Termes et définitions phytosanitaires
Introduction
Champ d'application
Cette norme de référence présente un répertoire de termes et leurs définitions qui ont une signification particulière dans le domaine de la quarantaine végétale au niveau mondial. Elle a pour objectif, en établissant un vocabulaire reconnu sur le plan international, de faciliter la rédaction et la mise en application des mesures phytosanitaires, ainsi que la communication entre les partenaires commerciaux.

Résumé de référence
Cette première révision du glossaire remplace le texte déjà publié sous le titre "Glossaire FAO des termes phytosanitaires", en anglais, français et espagnol (FAO, 1990). Elle rassemble la terminologie périodiquement révisée par un groupe international d'experts, assisté par les Organisations régionales de la protection des végétaux. L'objectif du glossaire est de faciliter les échanges d'informations dans le domaine de la quarantaine végétale, ainsi que l'harmonisation des termes utilisés dans les documents phytosanitaires officiels.
Le nouveau glossaire a également été rédigé en arabe et en chinois; il est accompagné d'un index multilingue permettant la référence croisée entre tous les termes. Certains termes, ou leurs définitions, ont été révisés pour des raisons techniques ou pour une plus grande clarté. D'autres sont absents, soit parce qu'aucune définition n'a pour le moment été acceptée, soit parce qu'aucune définition spéciale n'a été jugée nécessaire pour les besoins phytosanitaires, ou soit parce qu'aucun accord n'a été trouvé pour la modification d'une définition.
En principe, les définitions sont aussi simples que possible et doivent être cohérentes avec l'ensemble du glossaire. De nombreux termes sont déjà bien acceptés dans le cadre du commerce international agricole. Chaque mot en caractères gras est un terme dont la définition est donnée dans le glossaire. Les termes sont définis les uns par rapport aux autres; une seule fois pour éviter les répétitions inutiles d'éléments définis ailleurs. Par exemple, le terme "végétaux" inclut "parties de plantes vivantes". De même, une "zone" est définie "officiellement", etc.
Souhaitons que les termes nouvellement introduits dans cette révision du glossaire soient aussi largement acceptés que leurs prédécesseurs. L'évolution à venir des techniques et de la recherche dans le domaine phytosanitaire devrait conduire à l'utilisation de nouveaux termes qu'il faudra introduire dans les révisions du glossaire.

Glosario de términos fitosanitarios
Introducción
Términos y definiciones fitosanitarios
Introducción
Alcance
Esta norma de referencia presenta una lista de términos y definiciones con significado específico para el personal de cuarentena vegetal a nivel mundial. Ha sido desarrollado para proporcionar un vocabulario reconocido internacionalmente para la elaboración y aplicación de medidas fítosanitarias, así como para facilitar la comunicación entre las partes que mantienen comercio entre sí.
Referencias
Acuerdo Sobre la Aplicación de Medidas Sanitarias y Fitosanitarias, 1994.

Resumen de referencia
Esta primera revisión del Glosario reemplaza a la lista denominada "Glosario de Términos Fitosanitarios de la FAO" publicado en inglés, francés y español (FAO, 1990). Se incluye la terminología fitosanitaria acordada y revisada periódicamente por un grupo internacional de expertos en cuarentena vegetal, con el apoyo de las Organizaciones Regionales de Protección Fitosanitaria. Esta lista ha sido preparada para apoyar a las Organizaciones Nacionales de Protección Fitosanitaria, en el intercambio de información en materias fitosanitarias y su armonización, para el establecimiento de documentos oficiales en cuarentena vegetal.
El nuevo Glosario ha sido ampliado para incluir las listas en los idiomas árabe y chino, y acompañado de un índice en varios idiomas de consulta cruzada de todos los términos. Algunos de estos se han revisado a fin de mejorar la claridad y el lenguaje técnico. Términos no considerados en esta lista pueden ser eliminados por no requerir descripción especializada o no haber de alcanzado todavía el consenso internacional respecto a su significado general. Otros pueden ser tan nuevos, que aún no se han desarrollado definiciones comunes.
Se han hecho todo lo posible para mantener definiciones simples, asegurando la consistencia del lenguaje empleado en el Glosario. Muchas palabras han sido ya aceptadas en el comercio agrícola. Los términos básicos del vocabulario están impresos en "negrita" y definidos e interrelacionados, para evitar repeticiones innecesarias de los elementos descritos en otras partes. Por ejemplo, "plantas" incluye "partes de", así "partes de" no es repetida. "Area" está definida "oficialmente", por lo tanto, no está especificada como tal nuevamente.
Se espera que los nuevos términos incluidos en esta revisión recibirán una aceptación amplia. A medida que la ciencia fítosanitaria se progrese, la terminología adicional será adoptada e incorporada en las futuras ediciones del Glosario.

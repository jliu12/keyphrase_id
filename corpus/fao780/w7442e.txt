Foreword^1
^1 This paper was presented at the International Seminar: "Food Policies within the Context of Central America: the Case of Staple Grains", organized by the Government of Costa Rica, FAO and IICA Even though it was already published one year ago, we have decided to publish it again in order to assure a wider diffusion.
World food security and the struggle against hunger are some of the most important priorities that have been repeatedly emphasized by the international community. More recently, the Heads of State and Government gathered at the World Food Summit organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations, reaffirming their commitment and determination to achieve food security for all and in the context of an on-going effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015.
However, experience has shown that there is not an easy way to escape from chronic hunger and the constant threat of famine. Therefore, additional efforts are needed to understand the factors that cause widespread hunger and vulnerability to famines, and to design appropriate measures conducive towards creating an enabling environment for private and group initiatives to devote their skills and resources towards the common goal of food for all.
With the objective of contributing to this effort, we are pleased to share with you an important analysis that Professor C. Timmer developed in his paper "Food Security Strategies: The Asian Experience". In fact, in this paper, Professor Timmer reviews the recent literature on food systems and economic development and underlines their limitations. Simultaneously, he analyses the Asian approach to food security and concludes that, the lesson from East and Southeast Asia for achieving and maintaining food security can be summed up in this way: a growth process stimulated by a dynamic rural economy leads to rapid poverty alleviation, which, in the context of public action to stabilize food prices, ensures food security.
We consider that Professor Timmer's paper will be useful to both policy makers and economists working on policy issues.

Summary
Famine and food security are at opposite ends of a spectrum. It is only in modem times that entire societies, as opposed to privileged members of those societies, have been able to escape from chronic hunger and the constant threat of famine. Many countries in the developing world, especially in Africa and South Asia, have not managed to achieve this objective. In these countries, understanding the factors that cause widespread hunger and vulnerability to famines, and the mechanisms available to alleviate their impact, remain important intellectual challenges.
However, the present study underlines that there is a different way to pose the question. Rather than asking how to cope with hunger and famine, the question might be how to escape from their threat altogether. The main premise of this essay is that an early escape from hunger is not primarily the result of private decisions in response to free-market forces. Improved food security stems directly from a set of government policies that integrate the food economy into a development strategy that seeks rapid economic growth with improved income distribution. With such policies, countries in East and Southeast Asia offer evidence that poor countries can escape from hunger in two decades or less, that is, in the space of a single generation.
To achieve and sustain food security through rapid economic growth, the Asian experience suggests that the agricultural sector must be linked through three elements to food security: poverty alleviation, stability of the food economy, and growth itself. The effectiveness of these links depends critically on the initial conditions at the start of the process of rapid growth. In particular, agriculture can contribute little to equity if it is based on a "bi-modal" distribution of production or to stability if it is concentrated on a single export crop subject to substantial price fluctuations. Even in these circumstances, however, agriculture can be a significant contributor to economic growth.
Furthermore, the lesson from East and Southeast Asia for achieving and maintaining food security indicates that a growth process stimulated by a dynamic rural economy leads to rapid poverty alleviation, which in the context of public action to stabilize food prices, ensures food security.
This approach might not work in other settings, for example, where the staple foodgrain is traded in more stable world markets, or where land holdings are highly skewed, or where technologies are not available to raise agricultural productivity. In searching for appropriate food security strategies in these other environments, however, it is important not to misread the successful experience of East and Southeast Asia. In particular, free trade in rice and the full and immediate transmission of international price signals to domestic producers, traders, and consumers were not an element of food security in any of the successful Asian societies. Free trade is appropriate for most goods and services but the historical lesson from the countries of East and Southeast Asia that have emerged from hunger is that free trade in basic foodgrains overly constrains the public actions needed for governments to intervene on behalf of food security. In different circumstances, free trade
might well be a fast and efficient route to food security, but the role of governments in ensuring this security would be radically different than the role played by governments in Asia.

Food Security Strategies: The Asian Experience
Famine and food security are at opposite ends of a spectrum. It is only in modern times that entire societies, as opposed to privileged members of those societies, have been able to escape from chronic hunger and the constant threat of famine (Fogel, 1989, 1991). Many countries in the developing world, especially in Africa and South Asia, have not managed this escape. In these countries, understanding the factors that cause widespread hunger and vulnerability to famines, and the mechanisms available to alleviate their impact, remain important intellectual challenges (Ravallion, 1987, forthcoming; Sen, 1981; Dreze and Sen, 1989). Participants at the World Food Conference in Rome in November, 1996, will focus much of their attention on these challenges of coping with hunger (USDA, 1996).
There is a different way to pose the question, however. Rather than asking how to cope with hunger and famine, the question might be how to escape from their threat altogether. As Fogel has emphasized, this is a modern question that is only partly answered by the institutional and technological innovations that are at the heart of modern economic growth (Kuznets, 1966) Without these innovations, to be sure, the modern escape from hunger to food security would not have been possible. But the record of economic growth for the Third World since the 1950s shows that even in countries with relatively low levels of per capita income, government interventions to enhance food security can lift the threat of hunger and famine. The countries most successful at this task are in East and Southeast Asia, although the experience in South Asia has been instructive as well.

Food Security and the Escape from Hunger
Food Security and Economic Analysis
The Asian Approach to Food Security
That rich countries have little to fear from hunger is a simple consequence of Engel's Law; consumers have a substantial buffer of nonfood expenditures to rely on, even if food prices rise sharply. In a market economy, the rich do not starve. Wars, riots, hurricanes, and floods, for example, can disrupt the smooth functioning of markets, and all in their wake can perish. But rich societies usually have the means to prevent or alleviate such catastrophes, social or natural. Food security in such societies is simply part of a broader net of social securities.
Without the buffer of Engel's Law, consumers in poor countries are exposed to routine hunger and vulnerability to shocks that set off famines (Anderson and Roumasset, 1996). And yet, several poor countries have used public action to improve their food security.^1 The typical approach reduces the numbers of the population facing daily hunger by raising the incomes of the poor, while simultaneously managing the food economy in ways that minimize the shocks that might trigger a famine. These countries, some of them quite poor, have managed the same "escape from hunger" that Fogel documents for Europe.
^1 Defining food security is an exercise in itself, especially when both macro and micro dimensions are included in the definition In a recent review, Simon Maxwell (1996) listed 32 (!) different definitions of the term used by various authors between 1975 and 1991 Each definition is sensible in some context The goal of this essay is to understand the economic context in which food security is no longer a personal or a policy concern Almost any definition that is intuitively plausible will do for that purpose.
The main premise of this essay is that an early escape from hunger is not primarily the result of private decisions in response to free-market forces. Improved food security stems directly from a set of government policies that integrates the food economy into a development strategy that seeks rapid economic growth with improved income distribution (Timmer, et al., 1983). With such policies, countries in East and Southeast Asia offer evidence that poor countries can escape from hunger in two decades or less - that is, in the space of a single generation. Although two decades may seem an eternity to the hungry and those vulnerable to famine, it is roughly the same as the time between the first World Food Summit Conference in 1974 and the second one in 1996. Despite much well-meaning rhetoric at the earlier summit, including Henry Kissinger's pledge that no child would go to bed hungry by 1985, the failure to place food security in a framework of rural-oriented economic
growth, in combination with policies to stabilize domestic food economies, meant that two decades have been wasted in many countries.
Food Security and Economic Analysis
The focus here is on food security as an objective of national policy. The emphasis is on food security at the "macro" level. At that level, policymakers have an opportunity to create the aggregate conditions in which households at the "micro" level can gain access to food on a reliable basis through self-motivated interactions with local markets and home resources. The perspective taken is, thus, primarily an economic one.
Surprisingly, however, recent literature on food systems and economic development makes such an economic assessment of food security a difficult task. Three bodies of literature are potentially relevant to an analysis of how countries can escape from hunger and provide food security for their citizens, and yet none addresses the topic directly.
First, there is a substantial literature on the achievement of rapid economic growth (World Bank, 1993; Lucas, 1988; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1994; Taylor, 1996). Export orientation and openness to trade tend to be the dominant policy issues in this literature. In none of this literature is food security even mentioned, and agriculture receives only passing notice. Both omissions are surprising in view of the historical links between agriculture and economic growth and the fact that no country has sustained rapid economic growth without first achieving food security at the macro level (Timmer, 1996b);
Second, agriculture is treated in the literature on rapid poverty alleviation through rural-oriented economic growth (Timmer, 1991, 1995, 1996a; Birdsall, Ross, and Sabot, 1995; Ravallion and Datt, 1996; Lipton, 1977; Mellor, 1976). But even though the agricultural sector and the rural economy are the focus of this literature, no connections are made to price stability or other dimensions of food security, and trade issues are largely ignored.
Third, there is a growing literature on stabilization of domestic food economies and the contribution of stability to economic growth (Bigman, 1985; Chisholm, 1982; Sarris, 1982; Newbery and Stiglitz, 1981; Morduch, 1995; Timmer, 1989, 1996c; Dawe, 1996; Ramey and Ramey, 1995). But the stabilization literature is badly bifurcated into micro-based analyses of decision-maker response to risk (both consumers and producers) and macro-based assessments of the impact of instability, usually measured by rates of inflation, on economic growth. Virtually no analysis has been done to connect these two topics, which is surprising in view of the macroeconomic significance of the food sector in most developing countries. A further connection links food security to political stability, which is increasingly important as a factor influencing investment, including foreign direct investments and portfolio investments in these countries.
The Asian Approach to Food Security
Not surprisingly, food security strategies in Asia have been little influenced by this economic literature. The lack of influence stems from at least two factors. First, the dominance of rice in the diets of most Asians, coupled to the extreme price instability in the world market for rice, forced all Asian countries to buffer their domestic rice price from the world price. This clear violation of the border price paradigm and the accompanying restrictions on openness to trade seem to have escaped many advocates of the East Asian miracle, who see the region's rapid growth as evidence in support of free trade (World Bank, 1993).
Second, most Asian governments have paid little attention to formal efforts to define food security as a prelude to government interventions that would be seen as their approach to "food security." Instead, the food security strategies of most countries in East and Southeast Asia have had two basic components, neither of which is specifically linked to any of the standard definitions of food security used by international agencies. The United States position paper for the 1996 World Food Conference, for example, uses one version of these standard definitions:
Food security exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient food to meet their dietary needs for a productive and healthy life. Food security has three dimensions:
AVAILABILITY of sufficient quantities of food of appropriate quality, supplied through domestic production or imports;
ACCESS by households and individuals to adequate resources to acquire appropriate foods for a nutritious diet; and
UTILIZATION of food through adequate diet, water, sanitation, and health care.
(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 1996)
This definition is obviously an ideal that no country could hope to reach in fact. By contrast, the Asian countries that have been most successful at providing food security to their citizens have based their strategies on two elements of their domestic food system over which they have some degree of policy control: income growth and food prices.
The rate and distribution of economic growth are primarily matters of macroeconomic and trade policy (once asset distributions are given as an initial condition). Although there is continued controversy over what role Asian governments played in stimulating growth and channelling its distribution, there is no disagreement that high rates of savings and investment, coupled to high and sustained levels of capital productivity, in combination with massive investments in human capital, explain most of the rapid growth (World Bank, 1993). Therefore, growth that reached the poor was one component of the food security strategy.
In the second element of the strategy, Asian governments sought to stabilize food prices, in general, and rice prices, in particular. Engel's Law ensures that success in generating rapid economic growth that includes the poor is the long-run solution to food security. In the language of Dreze and Sen (1989), such economic growth provides "growth-mediated security." In the meantime, stabilization of food prices in Asia ensured that short-run fluctuations and shocks did not make the poor even more vulnerable to inadequate food intake than their low incomes required.
Economists are highly dubious that such stability is economically feasible or desirable It is not a key element of the "support-led security measures outlined by Dreze and Sen (1989) In a recent review of food security and the stochastic aspects of poverty, Anderson and Roumasset (1996) essentially dismiss efforts to stabilize food prices using government interventions:
Given the high costs of national price stabilization schemes (Newbery and Stiglitz, 1979, 1981, Behrman 1984, Williams and Wright, 1991) and their effectiveness in stabilizing prices in rural areas, alternative policies decreasing local price instability need to be considered The most cost-effective method for increasing price stability probably is to remove destabilizing government distortions Government efforts to nationalize grain markets and to regulate prices across both space and time have the effect of eliminating the private marketing and storage sector Rather than replacing private marketing, government efforts should be aimed at enhancing private markets through improving transportation, enforcing standards and measures in grain transactions, and implementing small-scale storage technology (Anderson and Roumasset, 1996).
Although this condemnation of national price stabilization schemes might well be appropriate for much of the developing world, it badly misinterprets both the design and implementation of interventions to stabilize rice prices in East and Southeast Asia (Timmer, 1993, 1996c)
For food security in this region, the stabilization of domestic rice prices was in fact feasible in the context of an expanding role for an efficient private marketing sector The resulting stability was not an impediment, but was probably conducive to economic growth In addition, the stabilization scheme and economic growth had to work in tandem to achieve food security as quickly as possible
Both elements of the Asian strategic approach to food security-rapid economic growth and food price stability-address the "macro" dimensions of food security, not the micro' dimensions found at and within the household Governments can do many things to improve food security at the household and individual level, and most countries in East and Southeast Asia have programs to do so Rural education accessible to females and the poor, family planning and child-care clinics in rural areas, nutrition education, and extension specialists helping to improve home gardens are just a few of the possibilities Most of the literature on food security deals with approaches at this level, but problems of definition, measurement, project design, and management vastly complicate strategies that rely on household interventions (D Maxwell, 1996)
The complications, in turn, sharply limit the number of households that can be reached with a micro approach Without dismissing the potential effectiveness of these approaches to enhance food security in particular circumstances, it is still important to realize the scale of the problem Hundreds of millions of people still do not have food security in Asia (although the number is shrinking rapidly in East and Southeast Asia), and programs directed at households will not bring it Only food security at the macro level can provide the appropriate facilitative environment for households to ensure their own food security That is the East Asian miracle
<section>5</section>
Conceptualizing the Strategic Approach
Achieving food security through a "macro" strategic approach involves active development of the agricultural and rural economy to link and stimulate rapid economic growth, poverty alleviation, and stability (see Figure 1). In turn, each of these three elements is a primary input into food security at both the macro and micro levels.
The mechanisms behind this strategic approach to food security are not well understood analytically or quantified empirically. The basic arguments, however, are straightforward. Improvements in agricultural productivity that are stimulated by government investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension, irrigation, and appropriate price incentives contribute directly to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and stability (Timmer, 1992, 1995).
For the large countries of Asia, investments to raise the productivity of domestic rice producers brought greater stability to the rice economy at the macro level, mostly because reliance on the world market was destabilizing in relation to domestic production. Expanded rice production and greater purchasing power in rural areas, stimulated by the profitable rice economy, improved the stability of food intake of rural households.
The dynamic rural economy helped to reduce poverty quickly by inducing higher real wages. The combination of government investment, stable prices at incentive levels, and higher wages helped reduce the substantial degree of urban bias found in most development strategies (Lipton, 1977, 1993). Equity is nearly always enhanced when urban and rural areas compete equally for policy attention and resources.
Once the process of rapid growth is under way, political tensions are inevitably induced by a structural transformation that takes place too rapidly for resources to move smoothly from the rural to the urban sector (Anderson and Hayami, 1986; Timmer, 1993). The agricultural sector is less prone to these tensions if the gap between rural and urban incomes does not widen too much. All successfully growing countries have had to find ways to keep this gap from widening so much that it destabilizes the political economy and jeopardizes continued investment.
A third set of mechanisms connects growth in agricultural productivity with more rapid economic growth in the rest of the economy. An entire body of literature exists that analyzes the role of agriculture in economic growth (Johnston and Mellor, 1961; Eicher and Staatz, 1990; Timmer, 1992, 1995). Specific linkages that have been identified in this literature work through the capital and labor markets, as analyzed by Lewis (1955); through product markets, as specified by Johnston and Mellor (1961); and through a variety of non-market connections that involve market failures and endogenous growth models (Timmer, 1995).
In turn, economic growth, poverty alleviation, and stability are linked to each other through the "virtuous circles" reviewed by Birdsall, Ross and Sabot (1995). Greater stability of the food economy contributes to faster economic growth by reducing signal extraction problems, lengthening the investment horizon, and reducing political instability (Ramey and Ramey, 1995; Dawe, 1996). In the other direction, stability contributes to equity and poverty alleviation by reducing the vulnerability of the poor to sudden shocks in food prices or availability. Greater equity also stimulates investment in human capital, especially in rural areas (Williamson, 1993; Birdsall, et al., 1995), thus speeding up economic growth.
Figure 1 The "Development Trilogy" and the Rural Economy
One important outcome of the strategic approach illustrated in Figure 1 is the achievement of food security. This occurs when economic growth has raised the poor above a meaningful poverty line and when stabilization of the food economy prevents exogenous shocks from threatening their food intake. In this approach, food security is sustained by the productivity of the poor themselves, but this security continues to depend on public action to maintain a stable macro environment, including the food economy, as the precursor to that productivity.

Modelling the Strategic Approach
From Individual Behavior to National Aggregates
What is Feasible?
"Trickle-Down Growth"
Growth With Redistribution
This strategic approach to food security can be understood more clearly if it is developed into a simple model of economic development. A framework borrowed from Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976) is used here to organize the discussion (see Figure 2). A calorie-income relationship, illustrated in Panel A, is used to identify a "poverty line" and a "famine line" (World Bank, 1986, Annex A). The standard Engel relationship in panel A portrays a representative consumer or household whose income (Y) determines calorie intake (C) according to a semi-logarithmic function, conditional on food prices (P). When food prices are held at their "average" level (P^A), the relationship shows that individual i will be below the poverty line C* when Y[i] is below Y*. A further reduction in income to Y^F would make the individual vulnerable to severe hunger. Famine would be widespread if individual i is representative of a broad class of individuals.^2
^2 There is an entire body of literature devoted to estimating the calorie-income relationship illustrated in Panel A of Figure 2 and to examining the significance of any relationship between calorie intake and severe health consequences, such as infant mortality or shortened life expectancy (Srinivasan, 1981, Poleman, 1981, Behrman and Deolalikar, 1988). The perspective here draws on Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976), Alderman (1986), and Alderman and Paxson (1992).
Panel A illustrates what happens to individual i when there are exogenous shocks to the food system, shown as equally likely "good" shocks, when food prices are low (P^L), and "bad" shocks, when food prices are high (P^H). When prices are high, more income is required to stay above the poverty line or the famine line. Obviously, factors other than food prices might affect similar vulnerabilities in particular households: illness, death of a wage earner, an additional child, and so on. The framework here abstracts from such idiosyncratic shocks to focus on individual income (or household income, where unitary decision making makes that a sensible approach) or economy-wide shocks.
From Individual Behavior to National Aggregates
The translation from individual behavior to national indicators of poverty or vulnerability to famine is shown in Panel B of Figure 1, which displays the distribution of income for the society. The starting point for the discussion is Y[0]|D[0], where average per capita income Y^A is distributed in a log linear fashion, with each income quintile having double the per capita income of the quintile below (see Table 1 for illustrative data). Such a distribution means the top quintile has a per capita income that is 16 times higher than the bottom quintile, a "poor" but not "bad" distribution of income. For comparison, Indonesia started its modern growth process in the late 1960s with a top 20/bottom 20 ratio of 7.5:1, whereas, in the 1970s, it was 15:1 in the Philippines and more than 30:1 in Brazil.
Table 1 offers a concrete idea of income levels that might be appropriate for this discussion. To start, the society has an average income per capita of $310 per year (about the level of India in the mid-1990s), distributed in such a way that the lowest quintile has an income per capita of $50 and the top quintile $800. The poverty line is drawn such that Y* = $200 and C* would be on the order of 2,100 kilocalories per capita per day.^3 Panels A and B can be read in combination to indicate the national degree of poverty and vulnerability to famine. To start, 60 percent of the population has incomes at or below the poverty line, and 30 percent is vulnerable to famine. This is a very poor, famine-prone society. The question is, how does such a society achieve food security?
^3 For convenience, all individuals in each income quintile are assumed to have the average income of that quintile However, income distribution in Panel B is drawn continuously after the first quintile to reflect the smooth distribution likely after incomes rise above a subsistence floor.

Define food security as an environment in which the lowest income quintile has a near-zero probability of being vulnerable to famine. The "escape from hunger" has a more challenging definition; it requires a similar near-zero probability of falling below the poverty line (defined strictly in calorie terms). Within the framework presented here, the escape from hunger and famine can be accomplished through one or a combination of three approaches. First, incomes can grow with no change in income distribution. Second, income distribution can improve with no change in average incomes per capita. Third, the domestic food economy can be stabilized to eliminate shocks that result in P^H as the prevailing price environment. The argument here, following Figure 1, is that the East and Southeast Asian approach of "growth with redistribution," relying heavily on stimulation of the rural economy, in combination with a policy to stabilize domestic food prices, is the fastest approach to
managing this escape (Chenery, et al., 1974; Timmer, et al., 1983; Dasgupta, 1993; Timmer, 1995; Birdsall, et al., 1995).
What is Feasible?
Both theory and the empirical record of economic growth during the second half of the twentieth century argue that only certain combinations of growth, redistribution, and price policy are feasible as long-run strategies. In particular, two appealing strategies for overcoming hunger in the short run must be ruled out. The first, a strategy of keeping food prices low (P^L) through direct subsidies and macroeconomic distortions, such as overvalued domestic currencies, eliminates all probability of famine in our illustrative society (see the bottom line in Table 1), and it ends poverty with either doubled incomes per capita (Y[1]) or a sharp redistribution of income (D[1]). The problem with this strategy, unfortunately, is one of incentive compatibility. The strategy is not sustainable because it fails to provide incentives to the rural sector and, consequently, it is unable to maintain levels of agricultural productivity (Timmer, et al., 1983; Nerlove, 1994; Taylor, 1996).
Without this productivity, the entire growth process is threatened.
The second strategy that fails is an immediate redistribution of income, from D[0] to D[1]. In Figure 2 and Table 1, this redistribution is shown as a change in the top 20/bottom 20 ratio from 16:1 to 6.4:1. These particular numbers result from doubling the income per capita of the bottom quintile, holding average income per capita at the initial level, and then maintaining a log linear distribution for the remaining income quintiles. This doubling accomplishes immediately what economic growth takes years to accomplish - the elimination of vulnerability to famines in an environment of price stability. Unfortunately, such revolutionary redistributions of income have carried powerful, negative consequences for economic growth because they disrupt property rights and incentives for investment. Without such investment, economic output cannot be maintained (Barrett, 1995; Levine and Renelt, 1992; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1994; Taylor, 1996).^4
^4 The extensive land reforms carried out in East Asia after World War II can be considered as a strategy of immediate income distribution They were carried out in revolutionary circumstances or at the instigation of foreign powers, and the reforms established a distribution of assets from which equitable growth was possible The conditions for similar reforms in other countries do not seem widely applicable in the 1990s (Tomich, et al, 1995).
"Trickle-Down Growth"
Two other strategies offer more hope. The first is economic growth with unchanging income distribution (Y[1]|D[0]). On the face of it, this strategy would seem to require a very long time to eliminate vulnerability to famine and hunger (World Bank, 1986). In the event of an adverse price shock, for example, even a doubling of income per capita in the lowest quintile leaves 30 percent of the population vulnerable to famine and more than half the population below the poverty line. In addition, with such an adverse income distribution and price instability, doubling of incomes per capita is likely to be slow, requiring 20 to 30 years (growth rates of income per capita of 2.4 to 3.6 percent per year) (Williamson, 1993; Birdsall, et al., 1995). It is not surprising that such "trickle-down growth" strategies have a poor reputation among most development specialists.
However, if the probability of P^H is reduced to near zero through public action to stabilize the food economy, even such a modest growth performance benefits the poor quite quickly by eliminating their vulnerability to famine. Many remain below the poverty line, 40 percent in the illustration, but they are protected from falling to the famine line because adverse price shocks are eliminated by the stabilization policy. This approach, in conjunction with urban food distributions to holders of ration cards, is a rough characterization of the Indian experience with food security.
The Indian experience is particularly interesting because the country started with a relatively egalitarian distribution of income. Because the country was so poor, however, absolute poverty was widespread, thus presenting a difficult dilemma. If substantial resources were used to subsidize food intake of the poor, sufficient funds would be diverted from productive investments to slow the rate of economic growth. Thus the strategic choice in much of South Asia-to opt for food security through distribution mechanisms that were built during British colonial rule to alleviate famines-may have sacrificed some of the potential for economic growth in order to provide "support-led" poverty alleviation (Dreze and Sen, 1989).
Growth With Redistribution
An alternative strategy of bringing the poor more directly into the process of economic growth offers considerably greater hope than trickle-down policies, even with effective stabilization of food prices. The alternative is, however, much more complicated to implement. Here, redistribution with growth is attempted, in order to shift from Y[0]|D[0] to Y[1]|D[1] in a relatively short period of time. In this strategy, incomes per capita double on average, as before, but redistribution of the increased output doubles the incomes of the poorest quintile yet again. Such a strategy, if it is possible, eliminates all vulnerability to famine, even in the face of a price shock, and nearly eliminates poverty when the growth strategy is implemented in conjunction with a policy of price stabilization. This is the Indonesian approach.
What are the barriers to such a strategy? It is clearly difficult to find a way to structure the growth process so that the poor gain in relation to the rich. Historically, the only way to do that has been a rural-oriented development strategy that raises productivity and incomes of the broad population of small farmers and other rural workers (Mellor, 1976; Tomich, et al., 1995; Timmer, et al., 1983).
Such a strategy, however, requires significant price incentives to create the rural purchasing power that, in turn, stimulates the rural growth needed to make the strategy consistent with overall macroeconomic performance. This consistency is crucial to maintaining internal economic balance (World Bank, 1993; Timmer, 1995, 1996b). Thus a growth strategy that aims at Y[1]|D[1] is probably not feasible without a price policy that approaches P^H as an average rather than as an extreme shock.
This "food price dilemma," in which poor consumers have their food intake threatened in the short run in order to fuel a long-run growth process that removes them from poverty, has been emphasized before (Ravallion, 1989; Timmer, et al., 1983; Sah and Stiglitz, 1992). But experience in East and Southeast Asia since the 1970s shows that such a strategy, when implemented in the context of large-scale investments in rural infrastructure, human capital, and agricultural research, can lead to economic growth and an increase in average incomes per capita of 5 percent per year or more, with the rate of growth in the bottom two quintiles faster than that in the top (World Bank, 1993; Huppi and Ravallion, 1991; Timmer, 1995).
With doubling times of 10 to 15 years for incomes per capita and redistribution in favor of the poor, the "rural-oriented, price-led" strategy has the potential to reach outcome Y[2]|D[1], illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 1, and shown for the 1970-1995 experience of Indonesia in Figure 3. With this strategy, the escape from hunger and famine is as complete as in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. At the rates of growth experienced by Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia since the mid-1960s, the escape has been managed in less than two decades.^5
^5 It should be noted that the income gap between "rich" and "poor" continued to widen in Indonesia between 1970 and 1995, despite the faster growth rate of the incomes of the poor during that period. In the bottom quintile, for example, per capita incomes increased by $336 (in 1995 US$) in the 25-year period, whereas incomes of the top quintile increased by $1,374. Even highly successful poverty alleviation does not necessarily solve the problems of income distribution, especially in the political arena.

Lessons from Asia
To achieve and sustain food security through rapid economic growth, the Asian experience suggests that the agricultural sector must be linked through three elements to food security: poverty alleviation, stability of the food economy, and growth itself. The effectiveness of these links depends critically on the initial conditions at the start of the process of rapid growth. In particular, agriculture can contribute little to equity if it is based on a "bi-modal" distribution of production or to stability if it is concentrated on a single export crop subject to substantial price fluctuations. Even in these circumstances, however, agriculture can be a significant contributor to economic growth.
Because of the dominance of rice in Asian diets, the prevalence of smallholder cultivators, the large size of many Asian countries, and the instability of the world rice market, the most successful countries in achieving food security developed effective programs and policies to raise the productivity of their own rice farmers. Many of these programs were explicitly motivated by the objective of self-sufficiency in rice, especially after the world food crisis in 1974, when the "world rice market" in Bangkok disappeared for nearly half a year. When long-run costs of production are less than the costs of importing, such programs make economic sense, and the "self-sufficiency" slogan can be used effectively to mobilize political and bureaucratic support.
But self-sufficiency campaigns can do much mischief. Many countries have a deep aversion to international trade, an aversion seen since well before the Corn Laws debate in England in the early nineteenth century. Lindert (1991) has documented an "anti-trade bias" in agricultural pricing and trade policy that has deep historical roots. In the face of this clear political preference for self-sufficiency, Asian countries have had a difficult time distinguishing legitimate concerns for food security from a simple desire not to import anything that could be produced domestically, whatever the costs.

Cumulative Distribution of Income
Even in Indonesia, which has an admirable record on stabilization of rice prices, higher productivity of rice farmers, and food security for nearly the entire population, self-sufficiency for a broad array of staple foods has become a policy objective (Timmer, 1994). An assessment of the steps needed to reach this objective concluded as follows:
If economic considerations should play a significant (but not complete) role in determining appropriate policy for rice and its contribution to Indonesia's food security, the economic arguments are even stronger for all non-rice commodities. There is simply no nutritional, political, or logistical rationale to override the long-run signals from the world market on which foods Indonesia should produce domestically and which it will be more economic to import, because these economic signals are the surest indicators of where to allocate resources for increased productivity and incomes (Timmer, 1994, p. 39).
Such openness to short-run price signals from world markets for all but the most important staple food, and for all commodities in the long run, will require more open and stable markets in the future than have existed in the past. One major attraction to developing countries of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations was the promise that liberalized agricultural trade would result in more stable prices on world grain markets. However, this promise may have been premature (Greenfield, et al., 1996; Islam, 1996). The shortages that caused high grain prices in world markets in 1995 and 1996 have renewed anxieties about future food supplies, and policy-induced reductions in grain stocks seem destined to cause greater, not less, instability in grain prices. Asia, with nearly half the world's population to feed, is understandably concerned about how much to respond with new investments in domestic production and how much to rely on privately-held stocks available in
international markets for supplies of basic grains.
However the balance is struck on domestic versus imported supplies, the striking improvement in food security in Asia since the mid-1960s, especially in East and Southeast Asia, is not likely to be threatened. That is the advantage of "growth-mediated" food security. From this perspective, the lesson from East and Southeast Asia for achieving and maintaining food security can be summed up in this way: a growth process stimulated by a dynamic rural economy leads to rapid poverty alleviation, which, in the context of public action to stabilize food prices, ensures food security.
This approach might not work in other settings - for example, where the staple foodgrain is traded in more stable world markets, or where land holdings are highly skewed, or where technologies are not available to raise agricultural productivity. In searching for appropriate food security strategies in these other environments, however, it is important not to misread the successful experience of East and Southeast Asia. In particular, free trade in rice and the full and immediate transmission of international price signals to domestic producers, traders, and consumers, was not an element of food security in any of the successful Asian societies. Free trade is appropriate for most goods and services, but the historical lesson from the countries of East and Southeast Asia that have emerged from hunger is that free trade in basic foodgrains overly constrains the public actions needed for governments to intervene on behalf of food security. In different circumstances, free trade
might well be a fast and efficient route to food security, but the role of government in ensuring this security would be radically different than the role played by governments in Asia.

Famine and food security are at opposite ends of a spectrum. It is only in modern times that entire societies, as opposed to privileged members of those societies, have been able to escape from chronic hunger and the constant threat of famine. Many countries in the developing world, especially in Africa and South Asia, have not managed to achieve this objective. In these countries, the challenge of understanding the factors that cause widespread hunger and vulnerability to famines, and the mechanisms available to alleviate their impact, has remained important. The present study emphasizes that there is a different way to approach the problem, however. Rather than asking how to cope with hunger and famine, the question might be how to escape from their threat altogether. The main premise of this essay is that an early escape from hunger is not primarily the result of private decisions in response to free-market forces. Improved food security stems directly from a set of
government policies that integrate the food economy into a development strategy that seeks rapid economic growth with improved income distribution. Countries in East and Southeast Asia offer evidence that with such policies, poor countries can escape from hunger in two decades or less, that is, in the space of a single generation.

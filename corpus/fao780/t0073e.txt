<title>Prevention of post-harvest food losses fruits, vegetables and root crops a training manual</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
Despite the remarkable progress made in increasing food production at the global level, approximately half of the population in the Third World does not have access to adequate food supplies. There are many reasons for this, one of which is food losses occurring in the post-harvest and marketing system. Evidence suggests that these losses tend to be highest in those countries where the need for food is greatest.
Both quantitative and qualitative food losses of extremely variable magnitude occur at all stages in the post-harvest system from harvesting, through handling, storage, processing and marketing to final delivery to the consumer. Although the subject of food losses had been on the agenda of many meetings, it was not until the 1974 World Food Conference and the 7th Special Session of the UN General Assembly that special attention was given to it. In response, the 1977 FAO Conference approved the establishment of a Special Action Programme for the Prevention of Food Losses. Initially, this programme focused on staple food grains but, since 1983, at the request of the FAO Conference, additional attention has been given to perishable food commodities: roots and tuber crops, fruits and vegetables.
As part of this programme, FAO has organized numerous regional, subregional and national workshops and training sessions to help technical officers to recognize and reduce post-harvest losses and enhance the efficiency of marketing operations. In 1985, a training manual (FAO Training Series No. 10, to be revised and reissued as FAO Training Series No. 17/1) on the prevention of post-harvest food losses in grain crops was published. The present manual, on the prevention of post-harvest food losses in fruits, vegetables and root crops, is based on material previously developed during FAO's training programmes and is now being published as a companion to the volume on grain crops in the FAO Training Series. This manual also complements and updates FAO's Marketing Guide No. 2, Marketing Fruits and Vegetables.
I trust that this manual will be of assistance to all those providing practical training for the prevention of post-harvest food losses in perishable crops.

Preface
This manual, Volume II of the training manual on the prevention of post-harvest food losses, presents material from a wide variety of disciplines associated with the prevention of food losses and development of marketing operations, particularly those in fruit, vegetables and roots and tubers. It is directed to field staff, project supervisors, teachers at agricultural schools and at training institutions, and extension personnel connected with the handling and marketing of those commodities.
This manual should serve as a reference work on the prevention of post-harvest food losses. For specific training purposes, the manual takes up a number of crops and techniques from which the trainer can select according to local conditions. Trainers are encouraged to supplement the material by practical work and by detailed worksheets or handouts covering special topics of local interest.
1. Introduction
1.1 The importance of post-harvest losses
Time and money are required to cultivate food products, and unless the farmer is providing food only for his own household, he automatically becomes part of the market economy: he must sell his produce, he must recover his costs, and he must make a profit.
Estimates of the post-harvest losses of food grains in the developing world from mishandling, spoilage and pest infestation are put at 25 percent; this means that one-quarter of what is produced never reaches the consumer for whom it was grown, and the effort and money required to produce it are lost-forever. Fruit, vegetables and root crops are much less hardy and are mostly quickly perishable, and if care is not taken in their harvesting, handling and transport, they will soon decay and become unfit for human consumption. Estimates of production losses in developing countries are hard to judge, but some authorities put losses of sweet potatoes, plantain, tomatoes, bananas and citrus fruit sometimes as high as SO percent, or half of what is grown. Reduction in this wastage, particularly if it can economically be avoided, would be of great significance to growers and consumers alike.
1.2 Causes of losses vary widely
Factors affecting post-harvest food losses of perishables vary widely from place to place and become more and more complex as systems of marketing become more complex. A farmer who is growing fruit for his family's consumption probably doesn't mind if his produce has a few blemishes and bruises. If he is producing for a market at any distance from his own locality, however, he and his workers, if he has any, must have a different attitude if he hopes to get the best money return on his work.
Figure 1. Principal marketing and distribution channels for fresh fruit, vegetables and root crops
By knowing his market, the grower can and must judge how important are the requirements of appearance, maturity and flavour for his produce. Furthermore, the grower must decide whether the investment in packaging will in fact pay for itself in increased value of the crop. It will be of no value to buy expensive containers for his produce if the field hands pitch them around and damage the contents. It is more important for the grower to change the attitude of himself and his workers toward reducing post-harvest losses than it is for him to think that buying fancy packaging will automatically solve his problems and improve his income. The farmer must give careful attention to:
* Market demand for the products he will grow; he must know the market and his buyers
* Cultivation
* Harvesting and field handling
* Packing or packaging
* Transport
* Market handling; possibly storage or refrigeration
* Sales to consumers, wholesalers or agents
* Perishability of the produce.
The following sections will discuss these among other factors. The grower must recognize that small changes in attitudes toward the prevention of post-harvest food losses may profit him more than changes in the techniques of the marketing chain, whether containers or transport improvements, and may cost him less in the long run. He must instruct his family, field workers, and others in the methods of reducing his losses.
2. Nutrition and fresh produce
2.1 The contribution of fresh produce to human nutrition
Most people eat a mixed diet of foods from plants and animals. In most societies, starchy staple foods, particularly cereal grains, are the main source of energy in the human diet. In certain areas, especially in the humid tropics, root and tuber crops, together with plantains and similar plants, are either the staple food or a supplement to cereal staples.
Fruit and vegetables are important sources of essential minerals and vitamins in the human diet. When eaten together with some root (potato, sweet potato) and leguminous (pigeon peas, beans, lentils) crops, they provide a proportion of protein requirements as well as variety in flavour and colour.
2.2 Energy requirements
* Starches and sugars, formed within the plant for its own use, are used as energy foods. Starch is the main component of root and tuber crops and also of plantains and green bananas.
* Oils and fats are also energy foods. Fresh produce contains only small amounts except for avocados, which contain 15-25 percent oil.
2.3 Food for body growth and repair
* Proteins are essential to the building and repair of muscles and organs. They are needed in large amounts by growing children. Fresh produce is low in protein content, although on a dry-weight basis some root crops such as sweet potato and potato as well as leaves of several crops have protein contents approaching that of animal products. Cassava has very low protein content.
* Minerals are required for health but only in small amounts as compared with energy foods and proteins. Sodium, potassium, iron, calcium, phosphorus and many trace elements are essential. Vegetables contain significant amounts of calcium, iron and some other minerals.
* Vitamins are essential for the control of chemical reactions in the body. Fruit and vegetables, and to a lesser extent root crops, are important sources of vitamin C and other essentials. Table 1 lists the important vitamins derived from fresh produce.
* Fibre or "roughage" is found in large amounts in fresh produce. Though indigestible, it plays an important part in the function of digestion, and a diet containing high fibre content is shown by medical studies to reduce susceptibility to disease.
2.4 Loss of food value in fresh produce
The keeping and the preparation of fresh produce after harvest affects its nutritional value in several ways, for example:
* Dry-matter content (the energy supply) is reduced with time as the continuation of living processes within the produce uses up stored food reserves.
* Vitamin C content decreases with time after harvest, and little may remain after two or three days.
* Cooking partially destroys vitamins C and B1. Raw fruit and vegetables are particularly valuable provided they are grown and handled hygienically.
* Peeling may cause significant loss of food value, especially in potatoes, where the protein content is just beneath the skin.
* Water used in cooking vegetables or fruit contains the dissolved minerals and trace elements of the food and should not be thrown out but used in soups or in preparing other foods.
Further information on the food value of fresh produce can usually be obtained at national nutritional councils or departments of health.

3. Pre-harvest factors in produce marketing
3.1 Pre-harvest influences on post-harvest performance
The overall quality and condition of fresh produce cannot be improved after harvest. The final potential market value of his produce depends on the grower's decisions on what and when to plant and on the subsequent cultivating and harvesting practices. The adoption of good post-harvest practices described in the later sections of this manual can extend the useful post-harvest life of fruits and vegetables but only to the extent that their quality and condition at harvest permit.
Growers in general rely on their own experience and local traditions in selecting crops and in cultivation practices, but if they want or need assistance they may need to be referred to agricultural extension officers or possibly to research and development specialists of their national department of agriculture or its equivalent.
3.2 Market factors for the produce
Market factors affecting farmers' decisions on the growing of specific crops are:
* potential purchasers for the produce: neighbours, townspeople, retailers, jobbers or middlemen, commission agents?
* quality requirements of the buyer: size, shape, maturity, appearance, perishability of the produce;
* pricing limitations of the buyer.
A commodity can be "too good" as well as "too bad": one that greatly exceeds market requirements may not bring higher prices and thus be a waste of labour and resources.
An important limitation of most markets is that only certain varieties of a commodity are traded and others are unacceptable. In Indonesia, for example, 242 varieties of mango have been recorded by the Agricultural Seed Experiment Station in East Java, but only seven have any commercial potential beyond certain villages. The non-marketable mangos, however, constitute about 70 percent of the total production, and the local grower can effectively increase his market share only by replacing existing trees with those of the desirable varieties.
In international trade, this specification of variety is of critical importance. Countries wishing to export have little choice but to offer what will be bought by importing countries. This holds true among developing countries. For example, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has consciously promoted trade in fruit and vegetables, many of which are common in the various countries, but there are still distinct preferences for different cultivars between countries.
New varieties are not easily introduced into developing countries and established as profitable crops. Apart from physical conditions and cultivation practices, problems may include the overcoming of traditional human conservatism unless there are compelling economic incentives.
3.3 Influence of production practices
Pre-harvest production practices may seriously affect post-harvest returns in quality and quantity and result in the rejection or downgrading of produce at the time of sale. Some of them are:
3.3.1 Water supply (Irrigation). Growing plants need a continuous water supply for both photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert light to chemical energy and produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water) and transpiration (the giving off by a plant of vapour containing waste products). Bad effects can be caused by:
* too much rain or irrigation, which can lead to brittle and easily damaged leafy vegetables and to increased tendency to decay;
* lack of rain or irrigation, which can lead to low juice content and thick skin in citrus fruit;
* dry conditions followed by rain or irrigation, which can give rise to growth cracks or secondary growth in potatoes or to growth cracks in tomatoes (see colour section, Figure 3).
3.3.2 Soil fertility, use of fertilizers. Lack of plant foods in the soil can seriously affect the quality of fresh produce at harvest. On the other hand, too much fertilizer can harm the development and post-harvest condition of produce. Some of the effects are:
* lack of nitrogen can lead to stunted growth or to the yellow-red discoloration of leaves in green vegetables, e.g. cabbage;
* lack of potash can bring about poor fruit development and abnormal ripening;
* calcium-moisture imbalance can cause blossom-end rot in tomatoes and bitter pit in apples;
* boron deficiency can lead to lumpiness in papaya (see colour section, Figure 4); hollow stem in cabbage and cauliflower; the cracking of outer skin in beets.
These are a few of the commoner soil-nutrition problems that can be readily identified at harvest. The problem of fertilizer balance in soils and its effect on crops is complex and depends also on other conditions such as temperature, moisture, acidity of the soil and reactions among different fertilizer chemicals. Severe soil-nutrition problems need reference to specialist advice, if available.
3.3.3 Cultivation practices. Good crop husbandry is important in achieving good yields and quality of fresh produce. Certain aspects are particularly important, such as:
* weed control-weeds are commonly alternate or alternative hosts for crop diseases and pests, and those growing in fallow land near crops are as important as those growing among the crop. Weeds also compete with crops for nutrients and soil moisture;
* crop hygiene-decaying plant residues, dead wood, and decaying or mummified fruit are all reservoirs of infection causing post-harvest decay. Their collection and removal are crucial factors in the reduction of post-harvest losses.
3.3.4 Agricultural chemicals. These are of two types:
* Pesticides and herbicides are used as sprays or soil applications to control weeds, disease and insect pests. They are dangerous because they can damage produce by producing spray burns if used incorrectly, and they can leave poisonous residues on produce after harvest. In most countries there are laws to control the use of pesticides, which should be used only in recommended concentrations. Strict observance of the recommended delay between the last spraying and the harvesting is required in order to keep poisonous spray residues from reaching the consumer. Advice on regulations should come from extension or other agricultural department officers.
* Growth-regulating chemicals are used in the field mainly to improve the marketability of fruit in order to control the time of fruit set and to promote uniform ripening. They are of little importance to small-scale production. Their effective use requires specialist knowledge, and they are mainly applicable to large-scale commercial production.
3.4 When is fresh produce to harvest?
A critical time for growers of fruit and vegetables is the period of decision on when to harvest a crop. Normally any type of fresh produce is ready for harvest when it has developed to the ideal condition for consumption. This condition is usually referred to as harvest maturity. Confusion may arise because of the word maturity since, in the botanical sense, this refers to the time when the plant has completed its active growth (vegetative growth) and arrived at the stage of flowering and seed production (physiological maturity) as shown in Figure 3.1. Harvest maturity thus refers to the time when the "fruit" is ready to harvest and must take into account the time required to reach market and how it will be managed en route. This time lag usually means that it is harvested earlier than its ideal maturity.
3.4.1 How is harvest maturity identified? Most growers decide when to harvest by looking and sampling. Judgements are based on:
* Sight-colour, size and shape
* Touch-texture, hardness or softness
* Smell-odour or aroma
* Taste-sweetness, sourness, bitterness
* Resonance-sound when tapped.
Experience is the best guide for this kind of assessment. Newcomers to fresh produce-growing may find that learning takes time. Harvest maturity can readily be observed in some crops: bulb onions when their green tops collapse and potatoes when the green tops die off. Other crops can be more difficult: avocados remain unripe off the tree after maturity.
Figure 3.1 The comparison of physiological and harvesting maturity is shown here. In the various crops. harvesting maturity may be at a very different stage of the plant's development from that of physiological maturity. (Source: Improvement of post-harvest fresh fruits and vegetables handling, FAO(RAPA)/AFMA, Bangkok, 1986)
Large-scale commercial growers combine observation with more sophisticated measurement:
* time-recording, from flowering to harvest;
* environmental conditions, measuring accumulated heat units during the growth period;
* physical properties, including shape, size, specific gravity, weight, skin thickness, hardness, etc.;
* chemical properties (important in fruit processing, less so in vegetables), sugar/acid ratio, soluble solids content, starch and oil content;
* physiological characteristics, including respiration rate, acidity or alkalinity (pH).
The final decision on harvesting will take account of the current market value of the expected yield, and also the time during which the crop will remain in marketable condition. With seasonal crops, growers are often tempted to harvest too early or too late in order to benefit from higher prices at the beginning and end of the season.
4. Perishability and produce losses
4.1 What are the principal causes of losses?
All fruits, vegetables and root crops are living plant parts containing 65 to 95 percent water, and they continue their living processes after harvest. Their post-harvest life depends on the rate at which they use up their stored food reserves and their rate of water loss. When food and water reserves are exhausted, the produce dies and decays. Anything that increases the rate of this process may make the produce inedible before it can be used. The principal causes of loss are discussed below, but in the marketing of fresh produce they all interact, and the effects of all are influenced by external conditions such as temperature and relative humidity.
4.2 Physiological deterioration
An increase in the rate of loss because of normal physiological changes is caused by conditions that increase the rate of natural deterioration, such as high temperature, low atmospheric humidity and physical injury. Abnormal physiological deterioration occurs when fresh produce is subjected to extremes of temperature, of atmospheric modification or of contamination. This may cause unpalatable flavours, failure to ripen or other changes in the living processes of the produce, making it unfit for use.
4.3 Mechanical damage (physical injury)
Careless handling of fresh produce causes internal bruising, which results in abnormal physiological damage or splitting and skin breaks, thus rapidly increasing water loss and the rate of normal physiological breakdown. Skin breaks also provide sites for infection by disease organisms causing decay.
4.4 Diseases and pests
All living material is subject to attack by parasites. Fresh produce can become infected before or after harvest by diseases widespread in the air, soil and water. Some diseases are able to penetrate the unbroken skin of produce; others require an injury in order to cause infection. Damage so produced is probably the major cause of loss of fresh produce.
The influences of all three causes are strongly affected by the various stages of post-harvest operations, discussed below. Furthermore, they all have great effect on the marketability of the produce and the price paid for it.
4.5 Types of fresh produce
Commodities entering the trade in fresh produce include a wide variety of plant parts from a large number of plant families and species. The words fruit, vegetables and root crops have no real botanical meaning but are terms of convenience used for horticultural and domestic purposes. As commodities, however, they may be conveniently grouped in relation to the type of edible plant parts, their response to post-harvest handling and their storage characteristics.
4.5.1 Roots and tubers. These are underground parts of plants, adapted for the storage of food materials. They are the means by which the crop survives unfavourable seasonal conditions, and they provide the food reserve enabling the plant to make rapid growth when conditions are favourable. They include:
Edible part Crop
Swollen stem tuber Irish or white potato (Figure 4.1a)
Compressed stem tuber (corm) Dasheen, tannia, eddoe (Figure 4.1b)
Root tuber (from fibrous root) Sweet potato (Figure 4.1c)
Root tuber (from main tap-root) Carrot, turnip (Figure 4.1d)
In most of these, the stored food material is starch, but in some tap-root tubers, such as carrots, it is mostly sugars.
Figure 4.1 Roots and tubers
4.5.2 Edible flowers. Plant breeders have produced various vegetables with dense massed flower heads that can be eaten when the flowers are immature buds. These have long been popular in temperate countries but in recent years have become well-known in the tropics, where cultivars that can be grown in warm conditions or at higher altitudes have been developed. In contrast to the massed flower head, the pineapple, one of the most widely produced tropical fruits, is formed by the fusion of a mass of immature and unfertilized flowers clustered around the plant's main stalk, which becomes the core of the fruit. Examples of such flowers are:
Edible part Crop
Massed flower heads Broccoli, cauliflower (Figure 4.2a)
Fused mass comprising unfertilized flower parts and main flower stalk Pineapple (Figure 4.2b)
4.5.3 Vegetative growth (leaves, stems, shoots). These common green vegetables are important sources of minerals, vitamins and fibre (roughage) in the diet. They vary greatly, but typical examples are:
Edible part Crop
Whole above-ground vegetative growth (before flowering) Cabbage, lettuce (Figure 4.3a)
Leaves only Dasheen (callaloo), spinach (Figure 4.3b)
Swollen leaf base Onions (including dry bulb onions), leeks (Figure 4.3c)
4.5.4 Reproductive structures. These are fleshy, seed-bearing structures eaten principally for their fleshy parts. They are mostly well-known fruits having a high sugar content when ripe and are normally eaten at that stage. Some, such as tomatoes and peppers, are used as salads or vegetables. In addition, some vegetables, such as immature green seed pods of some crops, are eaten before the seeds harden.
Figure 4.2 Edible flower structures
In a few crops the immature seeds only are eaten:
Edible part Crop
Fleshy fruits with single seed (drupe) Mango, avocado, plum (Figure 4.4a)
Fleshy fruits with several seeds Tomato, citrus (orange, grapefruit, mandarin, lime), cucumber, pepper, aubergine, banana (Figure 4.4b)
Immature green pods with partly developed seed Green beans, yard-long beans (asparagus bean, bodi), okra (Figure 4.4c)
Immature seed only Pigeon pea, green pea (Figure 4.4d)
Most of these examples are indigenous to the tropics and subtropics and are chilling-sensitive when held in storage.
4.6 The post-harvest physiology of fresh produce
Growing green plants use the energy provided by the sunlight falling on their leaves to make sugars by combining carbon dioxide gas from the air with water absorbed from the soil through the roots. This process is known as photosynthesis. The plant either stores these sugars as they are or combines the sugar units into long chains so that they form starch. The sugars and starches, known as carbohydrates, are stored in various parts of the plant and are used later to provide the energy for its further growth and reproduction. Starches are stored by root crops over the dormant period to supply the energy for renewed growth when dormancy ends. The energy for growth in both cases is released by the process of respiration, which occurs in all plant parts before and after harvest.
What is the normal pattern of activity of fresh produce after harvest? How is this activity affected by conditions after harvest, and what effect does this have on losses?
Figure 4.3 Vegetative structures
We referred earlier to physiological deterioration as one of the causes of post-harvest loss in fresh produce. The word physiology means the study of processes that go on within living things. When fresh produce is harvested, these processes of living continue, but in modified form. Because the crop can no longer replace food materials or water, it must draw on its stored reserves, and as these are used up, the produce undergoes an ageing process that is then followed by breakdown and decay. Even if produce is not damaged or attacked by decay organisms, it will eventually become unacceptable as food because of this natural rot. The principal normal physiological processes leading to ageing are respiration and transpiration (Figure 4.5).
Figure 4.4 Reproductive structures (fruits)
<section>2</section>
4.7 Respiration
Respiration is the process by which plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. As shown in Figure 4.5, oxygen from the air breaks down carbohydrates in the plant into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction produces energy in the form of heat.
Respiration is a basic reaction of all plant material, both in the field and after harvest. It is a continuing process in the growing plant as long as the leaves continue to make carbohydrates, and cannot be stopped without damage to the growing plant or harvested produce.
Fresh produce cannot replace carbohydrates or water after harvest. Respiration uses stored starch or sugar and will stop when reserves of these are exhausted; ageing follows and the produce dies and decays.
4.7.1 Effect of air supply on respiration. Respiration depends on a good air supply. Air contains about 20 percent of the oxygen essential to normal plant respiration, during which starch and sugars are converted to carbon dioxide and water vapour. When the air supply is restricted and the amount of available oxygen in the environment falls to about 2 percent or less, fermentation instead of respiration occurs. Fermentation breaks down sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the alcohol produced causes unpleasant flavours in produce and promotes premature ageing.
4.7.2 The effect of carbon dioxide on respiration. Poor ventilation of produce because of restricted air supply leads also to the accumulation of carbon dioxide around the produce. When the concentration of this gas rises to between I and 5 percent in the atmosphere, it will quickly ruin produce by causing bad flavours, internal breakdown, failure of fruit to ripen and other abnormal physiological conditions. Thus, the proper ventilation of produce is essential.
4.8 Transpiration, or the loss of water
Most fresh produce contains from 65 to 95 percent water when harvested. Within growing plants there is a constant flow of water. Liquid water is absorbed from the soil by the roots, then passed up through the stems and finally is lost from the aerial parts, especially leaves, as water vapour.
Figure 4.5 Photosynthesis and respiration
The passage of water through the plants is called the transpiration stream. It maintains the high water content of the plant, and the pressure inside the plant helps to support it. A lack of water will cause plants to wilt and perhaps to die.
The surfaces of all plant parts are covered by a waxy or corky layer of skin or bark limiting water loss. Natural water loss from the plant occurs only through tiny pores, which are most numerous on the leaves. The pores on the plant surfaces can open or close with changing atmospheric conditions to give a controlled rate of loss of water and to keep the growing parts in a firm condition.
Fresh produce continues to lose water after harvest, but unlike the growing plant it can no longer replace lost water from the soil and so must use up its water content remaining at harvest. This loss of water from fresh produce after harvest is a serious problem, causing shrinkage and loss of weight.
When the harvested produce loses 5 or 10 percent of its fresh weight, it begins to wilt and soon becomes unusable. To extend the usable life of produce, its rate of water loss must be as low as possible.
4.8.1 The effect of moisture content of the air on water loss. Air spaces are present inside all plants so that water and gases can pass in and out to all their parts. The air in these spaces contains water vapour, a combination of water from the transpiration stream and that produced by respiration. Water vapour inside the plant develops pressure causing it to pass out through the pores of the plant surface. The rate at which water is lost from plant parts depends on the difference between the water vapour pressure inside the plant and the pressure of water vapour in the air. To keep water loss from fresh produce as low as possible, it must be kept in a moist atmosphere.
4.8.2 The effect of air movement on water loss. The faster the surrounding air moves over fresh produce the quicker water is lost. Air movement through produce is essential to remove the heat of respiration, but the rate of movement must be kept as low as possible. Well-designed packaging materials and suitable stacking patterns for crates and boxes can contribute to controlled air flow through produce.
4.8.3 The Influence of the type of produce on water loss. The rate at which water is lost varies with the type of produce. Leafy green vegetables, especially spinach, lose water quickly because they have a thin waxy skin with many pores. Others, such as potatoes, which have a thick corky skin with few pores, have a much lower rate of water loss.
The significant factor in water loss is the ratio of the surface area of the type of plant part to its volume. The greater the surface area in relation to the volume the more rapid will be the loss of water.
4.9 Ripening of fruits
Fleshy fruits undergo a natural stage of development known as ripening. This occurs when the fruit has ceased growing and is said to be mature. Ripeness is followed by ageing (often called senescence) and breakdown of the fruit. The fruit referred to here includes those used as vegetables or salads, such as aubergine, sweet pepper, tomato, breadfruit and avocado.
There are two characteristic types of fruit ripening that show different patterns of respiration:
* Non-climacteric fruit ripening-refers to those fruits which ripen only while still attached to the parent plant. Their eating quality suffers if they are harvested before they are fully ripe because their sugar and acid content does not increase further. Respiration rate slows gradually during growth and after harvest. Maturation and ripening are a gradual process. Examples are: cherry, cucumber, grape, lemon, pineapple.
* Climacteric fruit ripening-refers to fruits that can be harvested when mature but before ripening has begun. These fruits may be ripened naturally or artificially. The start of ripening is accompanied by a rapid rise in respiration rate, called the respiratory climacteric. After the climacteric, the respiration slows down as the fruit ripens and develops good eating quality. Examples are: apple, banana, melon, papaya, tomato.
In commercial fruit production and marketing, artificial ripening is used to control the rate of ripening, thus enabling transport and distribution to be carefully planned.
4.9.1 The effect of ethylene on post-harvest fresh produce. Ethylene gas is produced in most plant tissues and is known to be an important factor in starting off the ripening of fruits. Ethylene is important in fresh produce marketing because:
* it can be used commercially for the artificial ripening of the climacteric fruits. This has made it possible for tropical fruits such as mangoes and bananas to be harvested green and shipped to distant markets, where they are ripened under controlled conditions;
* natural ethylene production by fruits can cause problems in storage facilities. Flowers, in particular, are easily damaged by very small amounts of the gas. Ethylene destroys the green colour of plants, so lettuce and other vegetables marketed in the mature green but unripe state will be damaged if put into storage with ripening fruit;
* ethylene production is increased when fruits are injured or attacked by moulds causing decay. This can start the ripening process and result in early ripening of climacteric fruit during transport. All produce should be handled with care to avoid injuries leading to decay. Damaged or decaying produce should not be stored;
* citrus fruit grown in tropical areas remains green after becoming fully ripe on the tree. It develops full colour after harvest only if "degreened" by the use of (manufactured) ethylene gas. The gas concentration, temperature, humidity and ventilation have to be carefully controlled in specialized rooms, so degreening is economically viable only for high-value export or domestic markets. In most tropical countries fully ripe green citrus fruit is acceptable to local populations.
4.10 Post-harvest damage to fresh produce
Physical damage to fresh produce can come from a variety of causes, the most common being:
4.10.1 Mechanical injury. The high moisture content and soft texture of fruit, vegetables and root crops make them susceptible to mechanical injury, which can occur at any stage from production to retail marketing because of:
* poor harvesting practices;
* unsuitable field or marketing containers and crates, which may have splintered wood, sharp edges, poor nailing or stapling;
* overpacking or underpacking of field or marketing containers;
* careless handling, such as dropping or throwing or walking on produce and packed containers during the process of grading, transport or marketing.
Injuries caused can take many forms:
* splitting of fruits or roots and tubers from the impact when they are dropped;
* internal bruising, not visible externally, caused by impact;
* superficial grazing or scratches affecting the skins and outer layer of cells;
* crushing of leafy vegetables and other soft produce.
Injuries cutting through or scraping away the outer skin of produce will:
* provide entry points for moulds and bacteria causing decay;
* increase water loss from the damaged area;
* cause an increase in respiration rate and thus heat production.
Bruising injuries, which leave the skin intact and may not be visible externally cause:
* increased respiration rate and heat production;
* internal discoloration because of damaged tissues;
* off-flavours because of abnormal physiological reactions in damaged parts.
4.10.2 Injuries from temperature effects. All fresh produce is subject to damage when exposed to extremes of temperature. Commodities vary considerably in their temperature tolerance. Their levels of tolerance to low temperatures are of great importance where cool storage is concerned:
* Freezing injury-all produce is subject to freezing at temperatures between 0 and -2 degrees Celsius. Frozen produce has a water-soaked or glassy appearance. Although a few commodities are tolerant of slight freezing, it is advisable to avoid such temperatures because subsequent storage life is short. Produce which has recovered from freezing is highly susceptible to decay.
* Chilling injury- some types of fresh produce are susceptible to injury at low but non-freezing temperatures. Such crops are mostly of tropical or subtropical origin, but a few temperate crops may be affected (Table 2).

Discoloration Internal or external or both, usually brown or black
Skin piking Sunken spots, especially under dry conditions
Abnormal ripening (fruits) Ripening is uneven or fails; off-flavours

Sensitivity varies with the commodity, but with each there is a temperature below which injury occurs: the lowest safe temperature (LST). Within a single commodity type, the LST may vary between varieties (Table 2). Fruit is generally less sensitive when ripe.
Symptoms of chilling injury may not develop until the produce is removed from cold storage to normal market (i.e. ambient) temperatures. When susceptible produce has to be held for some time in storage, it must be kept at a temperature just above its LST. This means that such crops will have a shorter marketing life than non-sensitive crops because respiration has continued at a relatively fast rate during storage at higher than normal cold-storage temperatures.
* High temperature injury - if fresh produce is exposed to high temperatures caused by solar radiation, it will deteriorate rapidly. Produce left in the sun after harvest may reach temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius. It will achieve a high rate of respiration and, if packed and transported without cooling or adequate ventilation, will become unusable. Long exposure to tropical sun will cause severe water loss from thin-skinned root crops such as carrots and turnips and from leafy vegetables.
4.10.3 Diseases and pests. Diseases caused by fungi and bacteria commonly result in losses of fresh produce. Virus diseases, which can cause severe losses in growing crops, are not a serious post-harvest problem.
Insect pests that are mainly responsible for wastage in cereals and grain legumes are rarely a cause of post-harvest loss in fresh produce. Where they do appear, they are often locally serious, e.g. the potato tuber moth.
Diseases. Losses from post-harvest disease in fresh produce fall into two main categories.
Loss in quantity, the more serious, occurs where deep penetration of decay makes the infected produce unusable. This is often the result of infection of the produce in the field before harvest.
Loss in quality occurs when the disease affects only the surface of produce. It may cause skin blemishes that can lower the value of a commercial crop. In crops grown for local consumption, the result is less serious since the affected skin can often be removed and the undamaged interior can be used.
Fungal and bacterial diseases are spread for the most part by microscopic spores, which are widely distributed in the air and soil and on dead and decaying plant material. Produce can become infected:
* through injuries caused by careless handling, by insect or other animal damage, or through growth cracks (see colour section, Figure 1);
* through natural pores in the above- and below-ground parts of plants, which allow the movement of air, carbon dioxide and water vapour into and out of the plant;
* by direct penetration of the intact skin of the plant (see colour section, Figure 2). The time of infection varies with the crop and with different diseases. It can occur in the field before harvest or at any time afterwards.
Field infections before harvest may not become visible until after harvest. For example, decay of root crops caused by soil moulds will develop during storage. Similarly, tropical fruits infected at any time during their development may show decay only during ripening.
Infection after harvest can occur at any time between the field and the final consumer. It is for the most part the result of invasion of harvesting or handling injuries by moulds or bacteria.
Post-harvest diseases may be spread in the field before harvest by the use of infected seed or other planting material. Many diseases can survive by using weed plants or other crops as alternate or alternative hosts. They are also spread by means of infected soil carried on farm implements, vehicles, boots, etc. and from crop residues or rejected produce left decaying in the field.
Post-harvest diseases can also be spread by:
* field boxes contaminated by soil or decaying produce or both;
* contaminated water used to wash produce before packing;
* decaying rejected produce left lying around packing houses;
* contaminating healthy produce in packages.
Pests. Although relatively few post-harvest losses of fresh produce are caused by attacks of insects or other animals, localized attacks by these pests may be serious.
* Insect damage is usually caused by insect larvae burrowing through produce, e.g. fruit fly, sweet potato weevil, potato tuber moth. Infestation usually occurs before harvest. Post-harvest spread is a problem where produce is held in store or is exposed to lengthy periods of transport.
* Rats, mice and other animal pests again are sometimes a problem when produce is stored on the farm.
4.11 Loss assessment
There are no generally accepted methods for evaluating post-harvest losses of fresh produce. Whatever evaluation method may be used, the result can refer only to the described situation.
In the appraisal of an existing marketing operation, the accurate evaluation of losses occurring is a problem. It may be suspected that losses are too great, but there may be no figures to support this view because:
* records do not exist;
* records if available do not cover a long enough period of time;
* the figures available are only estimates made by several observers;
* records may not truly represent a continuing situation; for example, losses may have been calculated only when unusually high or low;
* loss figures may be deliberately over- or understated for commercial or other reasons in order to gain benefits or to avoid embarrassment.
Consequently, if accurate records of losses at various stages of the marketing operation have not been kept over a period of time, a reliable assessment of the potential cost-effectiveness of ways to improve handling methods is virtually impossible, and the marketing position of the grower is difficult to strengthen. It is evident that the grower who wants to reduce his post-harvest losses must maintain reliable records.

5. Harvesting and field handling
5.1 Handle with care
The quality and condition of produce sent to market and its subsequent selling price are directly affected by the care taken during harvesting and field handling. Whatever the scale of operations or the resources of labour and equipment available, the planning and carrying out of harvesting operations must observe basic principles.
5.2 Objectives
The objective of the grower should be:
* to harvest a good quality crop in good condition;
* to keep the harvested produce in good condition until it is consumed or sold;
* to dispose of the crop to a buyer or through a market as soon as possible after harvest.
5.3 Planning
To meet these objectives, success in harvesting and marketing must depend on planning from the earliest stages of production, particularly in regard to:
* crop selection and timing to meet expected market requirements;
* contacts with buyers so that the crop can be sold at a good price when ready for harvest;
* planning harvest operations in good time; arranging for labour, equipment and transport;
* providing full supervision at all stages of harvesting and field handling.
5.4 Labour
With small-scale family production for local markets, the labour supply will probably not be a problem. As the scale of commercial production and the distances between the rural producer and urban consumer increase, more exacting requirements will have to be met in regard to training and supervising labour. It is economically sound in terms of return to invest more in proper packing and handling of the produce before it leaves the farm. Growers will have to train their own field labour, accepting whatever support local extension workers are able to provide.
5.4.1 Training workers. This training should cover general aspects of produce-handling for all workers and specific training for those engaged in tasks requiring greater skill.
General training. For everyone concerned with harvesting and field handling, general training should include:
* Demonstrations of the causes and effects of damage to produce, emphasizing the need for careful handling at all times to avoid mechanical injuries from such causes as:
1. Wooden containers with rough edges, splinters, protruding nails or staples;
2. Overpacking containers which are to be stacked;
3. Damaging produce with long fingernails or jewellery;
4. Dropping or throwing into containers at a distance;
5. Throwing, dropping or rough handling of field containers.
* An explanation of the need to avoid the contamination of harvested produce from such causes as:
1. Placing the produce directly on to the soil, especially wet soil;
2. Using dirty harvesting or field containers contaminated with soil, crop residues or decaying produce: containers must be kept clean;
3. Contact with oil, gasoline, or any chemicals other than those used specifically for authorized post-harvest treatments.
Specific training. Workers allocated to specialized tasks, such as crop selection and harvesting, and the post-harvest selection, grading and packing (if applicable) of the crop should be given specific training. This will include demonstration and explanation of:
* the methods of evaluating the readiness of the crop for harvest, and the rejection of unsuitable produce at harvest, according to market requirements;
* the actual technique to be employed in harvesting produce, e.g. breaking the stem or plucking, clipping, cutting or digging;
* the use of harvest containers, and the transfer of produce to field or marketing containers;
* the selection of marketable produce at the field assembly point and (if applicable) grading for size and quality;
* the correct application of post-harvest treatment (where produce is to be packed on the farm directly into marketing packages), e.g. fungicides, wax coating;
* the method of packing market packages or other containers.
5.5 When are conditions right for harvesting a crop?
When the crop is ready for harvest, labour and transport are available, and operations organized, the decision as to when to start harvesting will depend largely on:
* weather conditions;
* the state of the market.
The flexibility of the marketing date will depend on the crops. Some, such as root crops, can be harvested and sold over a long period, or stored on the farm to await favourable prices. Others, such as soft berry fruits, must be marketed as soon as they are ready or they will spoil.
When the decision to harvest has been made, the best time of day must be considered. The aim is to dispatch the produce to market in the best possible condition, that is, as cool as possible, properly packed and free from damage.
The basic rules to observe are:
* harvest during the coolest part of the day: early morning or late afternoon;
* do not harvest produce when it is wet from dew or rain. Wet produce will overheat if not well ventilated, and it will be more likely to decay. Some produce may be more subject to damage when wet, e.g. oil spotting and rind breakdown in some citrus fruits;
* protect harvested produce in the field by putting it under open-sided shade when transport is not immediately available. Produce left exposed to direct sunlight will get very hot. For example, aubergine and potatoes left exposed to tropical sunlight for four hours can reach temperatures of almost 50 degrees Celsius.
Produce for local markets can be harvested early in the morning. For more distant markets it may be an advantage-if suitable transport can be arranged-to harvest in the late afternoon and transport to market at night or early the next morning.
5.6 Harvesting technique
5.6.1. By hand. In developing countries, most produce for internal rural and urban markets is harvested by hand. Larger commercial producers may find a degree of mechanization an advantage, but the use of sophisticated harvesting machinery will be limited for the most part to agro-industrial production of cash crops for processing or export or both. In most circumstances, harvesting by hand, if done properly, will result in less damage to produce than will machine-harvesting.
Hand-harvesting is usual where fruit or other produce is at various stages of maturity within the crop, that is, where there is need for repeated visits to harvest the crop over a period of time. Machine-harvesting is usually viable only when an entire crop is harvested at one time.
Root and tuber crops. Most staple roots and tubers that grow beneath the soil are likely to suffer mechanical injury at harvest because of digging tools, which may be wooden sticks, machetes (or cutlasses, pangas or bolos), hoes or forks.
Harvesting of these crops is easier if they are grown on raised beds or mounds, or "earthed up" as is common in potato-growing. This enables the digging tool to be pushed into the soil under the roots or tubers, which then can be levered upwards, loosening the soil and decreasing the possibility of damage to the crop (Figure 5.1).
Other root crops, such as taro, carrots, turnips, radishes, etc. can be loosened from the soil in a similar manner by inserting the tool into the soil at an angle and levering the roots upwards. This method can also be used for celery if it has been earthed up or buried to blanch the stems.
Figure 5.1 Damage in harvesting roots' tubers and other underground crops is more easily avoided if crops are grown in mounds or raised beds.
Vegetables. Either the whole or a part of vegetative growth can be harvested by hands only or sharp knives. Knives must be kept sharp and clean at all times or they may spread virus diseases from plant to plant. Harvesting methods vary with plant parts harvested:
* leaves only (spinach, rape, etc.) and lateral buds (Brussels sprouts): the stem is snapped off by hand;
* above-ground part of the plant (cabbage, lettuce): the main stem is cut through with a heavy knife, and trimming is done in the field (the cut stem must not be placed on the soil);
* bulbs (green onions, leeks, mature bulb onions): immature green onions can usually be pulled from the soil by hand; leeks, garlic and mature bulb onions are loosened by using a digging fork as for root crops (such as carrots) and lifted by hand (Figure 5.1). Simple tractor implements are available for undermining bulbs and bringing them to the surface.
Flower structures. Immature flower heads (cauliflower, broccoli) can be cut with a sharp knife and trimmed in the field; broccoli can be snapped off by hand and subsequently trimmed;
Mature flowers (squash, chayote, pumpkin): flowers are plucked individually by hand, or whole shoot-bearing flowers are harvested as a vegetable.
Fruits. Many ripe fruits and some immature seed-bearing structures such as legume pods have a natural break-point of the fruit stalk, which can easily be broken at harvest. Fruit and other seed-bearing structures harvested in the immature or unripe green state are more difficult to pick without causing damage to either the produce or the plant. These are best harvested by cutting them from the plant, using clippers, secateurs or sharp knives. The clippers may be mounted on long poles for tree fruits, with a bag attached to the pole to catch the fruit (Figure 5.2).
Plucking methods vary according to the kind of produce being harvested:
* ripe fruits with a natural break-point, which leaves the stalk attached to the fruit, are best removed by a "lift, twist and pull" series of movements, e.g. apple, passion fruit, tomato (Figure 5.3);
* mature green or ripe fruits with woody stalks which break at the junction of the fruit and the stalk are best clipped from the tree, leaving up to a centimetre of fruit stalk attached. If the stems are broken off at the fruit itself. disease may enter the stem scar and give rise to stem end rot, e.g. mango, citrus, avocado (see colour section, Figure l);
* immature fruits with fleshy stems can be cut with a sharp knife, e.g. zucchini, okra, papaya, capsicum; these can also be harvested by breaking the stem by hand, but this method may damage the plant or fruit and the rough break will be more susceptible to decay than would a clean cut.
5.6.2 Mechanical aids. Because the supply of fresh produce to domestic markets in developing countries comes mainly from relatively small-scale producers with limited resources, mechanical systems for "once over" crop harvesting are likely to be rare. There is scope, however, for the use of mechanical aids in modest commercial operations, especially where tractors are available.
Figure 5.2 Picking poles are used to harvest tree fruit which cannot be reached from the ground or a ladder. Both the factory-made (a) and home-made (b) types have a cutting device and a catching bag (Figure 5.2a is adapted from A manual of post-harvest handling systems for perishable food crops. No. 001 Mango, Ministry of Agriculture. Lands and Food Production. and UCA. Trinidad and Tobago, 1986.)
The jobs where such aids are likely to be of use are:
* in harvesting potatoes, onions and possibly some other root crops, simple tractor-drawn harvesters to lift up the crops and leave them on the soil surface;
* in transporting produce from the harvesting point to the assembly area to await transport, tractors to draw trailers of laden containers or to carry either containers on pallets or bins.
5.7 Harvesting and field containers
The packing of produce directly into marketing packages in the field at harvest reduces the damage caused by multiple handling and is used increasingly by commercial growers. It is not a common practice in rural areas, where produce is sent to nearby markets and elaborate packaging cannot be justified, but commercial growers can view it as cost-effective if the packaging takes produce in better condition to market, where it can command a higher price.
Figure 5.3 A natural break-point occurs on many mature fruits at the junction of stem and stalk. At harvest time. thumb pressure applied there should be accompanied by lifting, pulling and turning the fruit
At all stages of harvesting and handling, methods should aim at avoiding damage to produce and providing ventilation to prevent temperature rises.
5.7.1 Selecting field containers for harvesting. These must be of a size that can be conveniently carried by the harvest worker while moving through the field:
* harvesting bags with shoulder or waist slings can be used for fruits with firm skins like citrus and avocados. They are easy to carry and leave both hands free. They should be designed for opening at the base to allow produce to be emptied through the bottom into a field container without tipping the bag;
* plastic buckets or other containers are suitable for harvesting fruits that are more easily crushed, such as tomatoes. The containers should be smooth, with no sharp edges or projections to damage the produce;
* baskets are often used for harvesting but may have sharp edges or splinters that can injure produce. If they are not sturdy, they may bend out of shape when lifted or tipped-especially if they are large-and crush or otherwise damage the contents;
* bulk bins, usually of 250 to 500 kg capacity, are used by commercial growers, where crops such as apples or cabbages are sent to large-scale packing houses for selection, grading and packing. Bins can be carried by a fork-lift attachment on a tractor to move the produce from harvesting points to assembly areas.
When unventilated bulk bins are used in the field, produce should be left in them only briefly, and protected from sun or rain. Produce held in bulk for long will overheat and be more subject to decay. Bulk bins transported over long distances must be perforated to minimize heat build-up in the contents.
5.8 Post-harvest hauling
5.8.1 Field and farm transport. Routes for the movement of produce within farm fields should be planned before crops are planted. Farm roads should be kept in good condition because great damage can be inflicted on produce carried over rough roads in unsuitable vehicles.
Containers must be loaded on vehicles carefully and stacked in such a way that they cannot shift or collapse, damaging their contents (Figure 8.1). Vehicles need good shock absorbers and low-pressure tyres and must move with care. Jolting of laden containers can aggravate damage to produce on rough roads, even at low vehicle speeds.
5.8.2 Transport from the farm. The destination of the produce leaving the farm will usually be one of the following:
* A local market - produce is usually in small containers carried sometimes by animals or in animal-drawn carts, but mostly by vehicles owned or hired by growers; public transport is sometimes used.
* A commercial packing house or processing plant-produce carried by trucks may be in palletized field containers, in bulk bins or in hand-loaded sacks or wooden or plastic boxes; where vehicles wait in the sun or rain for long periods before unloading, only the top part of the load should be protected by a covering; grass or leaves are not recommended for this purpose because they restrict ventilation and may be a source of disease; complete enclosing of the load with a tarpaulin is disastrous because it restricts ventilation and the temperature of the produce rises rapidly.
* A city market - this applies only where produce is packed in marketing containers on the farm; the conditions under which these should be carried are discussed in the section on transport.
6. Packaging of fruit, vegetables and root crops
6.1 Why packaging is necessary
Most fresh produce ready for market is composed of large numbers of small units of similar size which must be moved in amounts conveniently handled by one person. This is best achieved by using containers of capacities from 3 to 25 kg, up to dimensions of about 60 per 40 per 30 cm. Some commodities (e.g. potatoes) may be marketed in 25 or 50 kg sacks, and other large items, such as whole bunches of bananas, are moved without packaging. Leafy vegetables can be sold loose or tied in bundles and not packaged.
Most developing countries use traditional baskets, sacks and trays to carry produce to markets. These are usually of low cost, made from readily available materials such as dried grass, palm leaves or bamboo. They serve the purpose for fresh produce carried over short distances, but they have many disadvantages in big loads carried long distances.
Large commercial quantities of produce need better packaging in order to minimize losses and achieve the most economical use of transport. The aim is to protect the produce from damage in handling, transport and storage and to provide easily handled and counted containers of uniform size.
Packages of standard size can reduce the need for repeated weighing and can facilitate handling, stacking and loading. A wide variety of package types is fabricated from paper and paper products (compressed cardboard and corrugated cardboard, called fibreboard in some areas), wood and wood products (sawn timber and compressed chips) and plastics, both pliable and rigid. Each type must be considered in terms of its utility, cost and capacity to enhance the value of the produce.
Economy in packaging is always a desirable goal. A study in Thailand showed that a plastic crate, while costing five times as much as a traditional bamboo basket of similar capacity, was still useful after 20 times the number of journeys, putting the cost per journey of the plastic crate at about one-quarter of that of the bamboo basket. The crate also provided better protection of produce, easier handling and better stowing, and was easier to clean.
Perhaps improvements in the design and construction of indigenous containers might, in the context of the small-scale grower, prove to be a better solution than buying plastic crates.
6.2 Damage suffered by packaged produce
6.2.1 From injuries
* Cuts or punctures
Cause: sharp objects piercing package; splinters in bamboo or wooden containers; staples or nails protruding in containers;
Effect: deep punctures or cuts in produce, leading to water loss and rapid decay
* Impact (shock)
Cause: throwing or dropping of packages; sudden starting or stopping of vehicle, causing load movement; speeding vehicle on rough road;
Effect: bursting of packaging, bruising of contents
* Compression (squeezing or squashing)
Cause: flimsy or oversized containers; containers overfilled or stacked too high or both; collapse of stacked containers during transport;
Effect: bruising or crushing of contents (Figure 6.1)
* Vibration (shaking)
Cause: vibration of the vehicle itself and from rough roads;
Effect: wooden boxes come apart, damaging produce
6.2.2 From the environment
* Heat damage
Cause: exposure of packages to external heat, e.g. direct sunlight, or storage near heating system; natural buildup of internal heat of produce owing to poor ventilation within package, in storage or vehicle;
Effect: fruit becomes overripe or softens; produce wilts and develops off-flavours; decay develops rapidly; cardboard cartons may become dry and brittle, easily damaged on impact;
* Chilling or freezing damage
Cause: low or subzero ambient temperatures; exposure of sensitive produce to temperatures below chilling or freezing tolerance level during storage;
Effect: damage to chilling-sensitive produce; breakdown of frozen produce on thawing; plastic containers become brittle and may crack;
* Moisture and free-water damage
Cause: exposure to rain or high humidity; condensation on packages and produce moved from cold store to damp atmosphere at ambient temperature; packing wet produce in cardboard containers;
Effect: softening and collapse of stacked cardboard containers; squashing of produce in collapsed containers; decay promoted in damaged produce;
* Damage from light
Cause: plastic sacks and crates not treated with an ultraviolet inhibitor eventually break up when exposed to direct sunlight;
Effect: disintegration of plastic sacks damages produce when it is moved; fracturing of plastic crates can cut or bruise produce;
6.2.3 From other causes
* Chemical contamination
Cause: contamination of containers stored near chemicals; damage to produce by containers treated with preservatives, e.g. boxes made from wood treated with pentachlorphenate (PCP) (see colour section, Figure 5); contamination of produce from boxes affected by mould growth;
Effect: flavour contamination or surface damage and discoloration of produce in contact with container; decay of produce owing to contaminating moulds; wood-rotting moulds cause collapse of boxes;
* Insect damage
Cause: insects present in packed produce; wood-boring insects in wooden boxes;
Effect: consumer resistance and legal problems from presence of insects (e.g. spiders, cockroaches) in packed produce; spread of wood-destroying insects in infected boxes;
* Human and animal damage
Cause: contamination and eating by rodents and birds; pilfering by humans;
Effect: rejection of damaged produce by buyers or inspectors; loss of income through loss of produce.
6.3 The cost-effectiveness of packaging
The use of packaging represents an added cost in marketing and the price of the marketed product must take account of the capital outlay and unit-packaging cost as well as expected profit. To make an exact assessment of the added value is difficult because many factors may offset the cost of packaging, for example:
* losses should be significantly reduced;
* presentation and quality of the product may make it more desirable, a competitive advantage;
* marketable life of the produce may be extended.
It is clear, however, that packaging must not exceed the willingness of the market to accept the added value of the product, i.e. the extra cost involved.
6.3.1 Prevention of injuries to produce. Suitable packages and handling techniques can reduce the amount of damage to which fresh produce is exposed during marketing:
* to keep the packaging itself from damaging produce during handling and transport, wooden boxes or cardboard cartons must be properly assembled; nails, staples and splinters are always a danger in wooden boxes;
* individual items of produce should be packed to avoid rubbing against each other during handling and transport; loose-fill packs are particularly susceptible to vibration damage;
* bruising results from overfilling containers or from the collapse of boxes; collapse may be caused by weak walls of boxes, by the softening of cardboard walls because of moisture or by the failure to stack boxes so that the side and end walls support those above; stacks of boxes should never exceed the height that has been recommended by the maker;
* produce in woven jute sacks or nets is especially susceptible to shock damage; sacks of 25 or 50 kg capacity are normally used for relatively low-value produce, such as root and tuber crops, and are often roughly handled on account of their weight; where possible, handling of bagged produce should be minimized by stacking sacks in unit loads on pallets or in pallet boxes.
6.3.2 Effect of packaging on other types damage
* Heat, chilling or freezing
Packaging in general has poor insulating qualities and will have little effect on preventing damage from heat or cold. Lack of ventilation in packaging delays cooling and may contribute to high-temperature damage arising from heat generated by the produce itself. Recently developed expanded polystyrene packages have good insulating properties and are used, topped with ice, to transport vegetables with high respiration rates.
The availability and cost of such packages make them inappropriate in most developing countries.
* Moisture and free water damage
High humidity and free water (e.g. rain) quickly weaken cardboard boxes, which get soggy and collapse when wet. This problem can be overcome in manufacture only by waxing the cardboard or by facing it with moisture resistant plastic.
Decay of produce packed in wet sacks or in wet wooden or cardboard boxes will be accelerated.
6.3.3 Chemical contamination. Packaging will not protect produce from contamination by outside sources of chemicals. The containers themselves become impregnated and contribute to the contamination.
Sacks and "knocked down" wooden or cardboard boxes awaiting assembly should not be stored in the same area as chemicals.
6.4 Selection of packaging for fresh produce
Packaging can be a major item of expense in produce marketing, so the selection of suitable containers for commercial-scale marketing requires careful consideration.
Besides providing a uniform-size package to protect the produce, there are other requirements for a container:
* it should be easily transported when empty and occupy less space than when full, e.g. plastic boxes which nest in each other when empty, collapsible cardboard boxes, fibre or paper or plastic sacks;
* it must be easy to assemble, fill and close either by hand or by use of a simple machine;
* it must provide adequate ventilation for contents during transport and storage;
* its capacity should be suited to market demands;
* its dimensions and design must be suited to the available transport in order to load neatly and firmly;
* it must be cost-effective in relation to the market value of the commodity for which used;
* it must be readily available, preferably from more than one supplier.
6.4.1 Size and shape of packages. Packages should be of a size which can be easily handled and which is appropriate to the particular marketing system. The size should be no larger than is compatible with these requirements, especially with wooden boxes. The ratio of weight of the container to that of the produce it contains is important. Where transport charges are calculated on a weight basis, heavy packaging can contribute significantly to the final cost of the saleable product.
The shape of packages is also significant because of the loading factor: the way the load is positioned on the transport vehicle for maximum capacity and stability. Round baskets, whether cylindrical or tapered, hold considerably less produce than do boxes occupying the same space. A cylindrical basket contains only 78.5 percent by volume compared with a rectangular box occupying the same space.
6.4.2 The need for ventilation in packages. Suitable packaging for any product will consider the need to keep the contents well ventilated to prevent the buildup of heat and carbon dioxide. The ventilation of produce in containers is a requirement at all stages of marketing, but particularly during transport and storage. Ventilation is necessary for each package, but there must also be an adequate air flow through stacked packages. A tight stack pattern is acceptable only if packages are designed to allow air to circulate through each package and throughout the stack. Sacks and net bags must be stacked so that air can circulate through the contents.
The effectiveness of ventilation during transport also depends upon the air passing through the load.
6.5 Packaging materials
Packaging for fresh produce is of several types:
6.5.1 Natural materials. Baskets and other traditional containers are made from bamboo, rattan, straw, palm leaves, etc. throughout the developing world. Both raw materials and labour costs are normally low, and if the containers are well made, they can be reused.
Disadvantages are:
* they are difficult to clean when contaminated with decay organisms;
* they lack rigidity and bend out of shape when stacked for long-distance transport;
* they load badly because of their shape;
* they cause pressure damage when tightly filled;
* they often have sharp edges or splinters causing cut and puncture damage.
6.5.2 Wood. Sawn wood is often used to make reusable boxes or crates, but less so recently because of cost. Veneers of various thicknesses are used to make lighter boxes and trays (Figure 6.2). Wooden boxes are rigid and reusable and, if made to a standard size, stack well on trucks.
Disadvantages are:
* they are difficult to clean adequately for multiple use;
* they are heavy and costly to transport;
* they often have sharp edges, splinters and protruding nails, requiring some form of liner to protect the contents.
6.5.3 Cardboard (sometimes called fibreboard). Containers are made from solid or corrugated cardboard. The types closing with either foldover or telescopic (i.e. separate) tops are called boxes or cases. Shallower and opentopped ones are called trays. Boxes are supplied in collapsed fore, (that is, flat) and are set up by the user. The setting-up and closing of boxes requires taping, glueing, stapling or the fixing of interlocking tabs (Figure 6.3).
Cardboard boxes are lightweight and clean, and can readily be printed with publicity and information on contents, amounts and weights. They are available in a wide range of sizes, designs and strengths.
Disadvantages are:
* they may, if used only once, prove an expensive recurring cost (if multiple use is intended, the boxes may be easily collapsed when empty);
* they are easily damaged by careless handling and stacking;
* they are seriously weakened if exposed to moisture;
* they can be ordered economically only in large quantities; small quantities can be prohibitively expensive.
6.5.4 Moulded plastics. Reusable boxes moulded from high-density polythene are widely used for transporting produce in many countries. They can be made to almost any specifications. They are strong, rigid, smooth, easily cleaned and can be made to stack when full of produce and nest when empty in order to conserve space.
Disadvantages are:
* they can be produced economically only in large numbers but are still costly;
* they have to be imported into most developing countries, adding to the cost and usually requiring foreign currency for their acquisition;
* they often have many alternative uses (as washtubs, etc.) and are subject to high pilferage rates;
* they require a tight organization and control for use in a regular go-and-return service;
* they deteriorate rapidly when exposed to sunlight (especially in the tropics) unless treated with an ultraviolet inhibitor, a factor adding to the cost.
Figure 6.3 Fresh produce is carried in a variety of cardboard containers
Despite their cost, however, their capacity for reuse can make them an economical investment. The Thailand study mentioned above showed plastic containers still usable after more than 100 journeys.
6.5.5 Natural and synthetic fibres. Sacks or bags for fresh produce can be made from natural fibres like jute or sisal or from synthetic polypropylene or polyethylene fibres or tapes. "Bags" usually refers to small containers of up to about 5 kg capacity. They may be woven to a close texture or made in net form. Nets usually have a capacity of about 15 kg. Bags or sacks are mostly used for less easily damaged produce such as potatoes and onions, but even these crops should have careful handling to prevent injury.
Disadvantages are:
* they lack rigidity, and handling can damage contents;
* they are often too large for careful handling; sacks dropped or thrown will result in severe damage to the contents;
* they impair ventilation when stacked if they are finely woven;
* they may be so smooth in texture that stacks are unstable and collapse; they are difficult to stack on pallets.
6.5.6 Paper or plastic film. Paper or plastic film is often used to line packing boxes in order to reduce water loss of the contents or to prevent friction damage.
Paper sacks can have walls of up to six layers of kraft (heavy wrapping) paper. They can have a capacity of about 25 kg and are mostly used for produce of relatively low value. Closure can be done by machine-stitching across the top (recommended only for large-scale crop production) or in the field by twisting wire ties around the top by means of a simple tool (Figure 6.4).
Disadvantages are:
* walls of paper are permeable by water or vapour and gases (walls may be waterproofed by incorporating plastic film or foil, but sacks then retain gases and vapour);
* heat can be slow to disperse from stacks of sacked produce, thus damaging fruit or leafy vegetables;
* limited protection to contents if sacks are mishandled.
Plastic-film bags or wraps are, because of their low cost, widely used in fruit and vegetable marketing, especially in consumer-size packs. In many developing countries, however, large polythene bags are and should not be used to carry produce, especially to market.
Disadvantages are:
* they offer almost no protection from injury caused by careless handling;
* they retain water vapour thus reducing water loss from the contents; but where temperature changes occur, they cause a heavy buildup of condensation leading to decay;
* they cause a rapid buildup of heat if bags are exposed to sunlight;
* they permit only slow gas exchange; this combined with vapour and heat leads to very rapid deterioration;
* they should not be used for carrying produce; even with perforations for ventilation, plastic bags should not be used unless the package can be refrigerated.
Consumer packs wrapped in plastic are not recommended under tropical conditions except perhaps in stores with refrigerated display cabinets.

6.6 Deciding on packaging for fresh produce
Before deciding on what packaging to use, the grower or packing-house operator has to consider many factors to ensure that the cost does not exceed the benefits. The decision should be made after consultation with market operators, packaging suppliers, transport operators and post-harvest extension advisers. Factors to consider are:
* the type of produce;
* the present level of produce losses that occur during the marketing process;
* the comparative costs of the present and improved packaging;
* expected reduction of losses if packaging is improved (based on research results);
* expected increase in income from reduction of losses;
* is a standard type of package available? Cost-per-unit of packages declines considerably when they are bought on a large scale; specially designed packaging is costly;
* will there be a regular supply of the new packaging?
* is adequate storage and assembly space available for the protection of packaging materials before use?
* is the change in packaging acceptable to the market?
If the introduction of new packaging does not result in increased returns, it cannot be economically feasible. Most experience shows that good produce well packaged has an advantage over produce poorly packaged, and the profits from it can cover the investment. Good packaging can therefore be held to be cost-effective in marketing.
There is no assurance that new packaging will by itself eliminate or greatly reduce post-harvest losses of fresh produce. Packaging is only one factor in the effort to improve handling at every step in the marketing process.
7. Packing houses and equipment
7.1 The need
Fresh produce sold through markets or by direct sales to users or agents must undergo some form of sorting and packaging. For the most part, the preparation of produce for market is carried out in a packing house, which may range from a simple, on-the-farm thatched shed to an automated regional packaging line handling large tonnages of a single commercial crop like citrus fruit or apples.
Whether it is simple or complex, the packing house provides a sheltered environment whose purpose is the assembly, sorting, selection and packaging of produce in an orderly manner with a minimum of delay and waste.
The size and design of the packing house, and the equipment and facilities required for it, will depend on the type and volume of produce, the market requirements, local infrastructure, its expected life span and its projected cost. In the planning stages, the factors to consider include:
* operations to be carried out;
* location of a suitable site;
* design of the structure and building materials available;
* equipment to be used;
* management.
7.2 Operations
Depending on the crop or crops being handled and the market being served, some or all of the following operations will be undertaken:
* reception: off-loading, checking, recording;
* sorting;
* special treatments, if required (cleaning or washing, fungicide spraying, selection, size-grading);
* packing;
* post-packaging treatments, if required (fumigation, cooling, storage);
* assembly and dispatch.
To be avoided at all costs is the all too common state of confusion where, in a confined space on a floor covered in plant trash, produce is being received, sorted, cleaned, dipped in fungicide, packed and stacked for dispatch (see colour section, Figure 6).
Where several producers supply the packing house, each delivery should be:
* labelled to identify its source and date of arrival;
* checked for quantity or weight delivered;
* sampled for quality, if necessary;
* acknowledged by a receipt to the supplier.
The reception area should be organized so that produce moves through the packing operation in the order it is received: first in, first out.
7.2.1 Sorting. A preliminary sorting of produce should remove unmarketable pieces and foreign matter (plant debris, soil or stones) before the produce passes on to further operations. All discarded material should be quickly hauled away from the packing house or placed in closeable bins for later removal. This is because accumulations of decaying or infested waste in or near the packing house will contaminate produce destined for market.
7.2.2 Cleaning and washing. The removal of soil and stones mentioned above can be done by hand-picking or by sieving. Some types of produce can be washed, brushed, or cleaned with a soft cloth.
Cleaning produce by hand-polishing or machine-brushing can remove light soil contamination or dust from produce, especially fruit. This should be done with care since damage to the skin of fresh produce will promote early decay.
Washing is required to clean produce which has acquired latex stains from injuries caused during harvesting, notably in mangoes and bananas. It is important to note that washing should be carried out only when absolutely essential. If it is necessary to wash produce, a fungicide should normally be applied immediately afterwards.
Use only clean, running water for washing. The washing of produce in recirculated or stagnant water should be avoided because it can quickly become heavily contaminated with decay organisms, leading to heavy rotting of the washed produce.
There are no acceptable or effective antibacterial agents available for treating water used to wash fresh produce. Hypochlorites or chlorine gas may be added to washing water used for commercial treatment of some products, but its use in recirculated or stagnant water cannot be recommended for small-scale washing operations because it is quickly inactivated by organic material such as plant debris in the water. The monitoring of the chlorine concentration in the wash water and its replenishment are difficult to achieve and, in any case, chlorine is of only limited effectiveness against decay.
Washed produce which is to be treated with fungicide should first be drained after washing in order to reduce the danger that residual wash water will dilute the fungicide below its effective concentration. When washing is not to be followed by fungicide treatment, the washed produce should be spread out in a single layer on raised racks of mesh or slats, in the shade but exposed to good ventilation to aid rapid drying (Figure 7.1).
7.2.3 Fungicide treatment. Decay caused by moulds or bacteria is a major cause of loss of fresh produce during marketing. Infection may occur before or after harvest, either through injuries or by direct penetration of the intact skin of produce. Pre-harvest infections often lie dormant until after harvest, especially in fruit, where they may develop only as the fruit ripens. Mangoes, bananas, avocados and sweet peppers are subject to latent anthracnose infections (see colour section, Figure 2).
Post-harvest application of fungicide is usual on crops such as apples, bananas and citrus fruit which are to be stored for a long period or those which undergo long periods of transport to distant markets. As stated above, fungicides are normally applied only after the produce has been washed and drained.
Most fungicides used for post-harvest decay control are in the form of wettable powders or emulsifiable concentrations. They form suspensions in water, not solutions; this means that they settle out of suspension if the mixture is not constantly agitated during its application. Thus the concentration of fungicide applied to the crop will fall below the effective level if the suspension is not continuously stirred.
In small-scale packing operations, fungicide can be applied by:
Dipping. Treatment is carried out by hand, using a suspension of fungicide agitated by hand (Figure 7.2); wire-mesh baskets can be used to dip several small pieces at one time; after dipping, produce should be drained and dried in a shaded, airy place.
Spraying. This can be accomplished with a hand-operated knapsack sprayer while produce is still in trays or racks after washing and drying produce should be sprayed completely and to the point of runoff (Figure 7.3).
Larger spraying operations may require a simple mechanized spray or drenching arrangement with a mechanical mixer for the fungicide. Produce passes through the spray or drenching in perforated trays perhaps while moving on a belt or roller conveyor (Figure 7.4).
Other methods of application, such as smokes, dusts or vapour, are used only by large-scale operations where produce is to be stored.
7.2.4 Ouality selection and size grading. Although produce will have been sorted on the farm or on its arrival at the packing house (Figure
7.5), there may be a further selection for quality and size immediately before it is packed. The scope of these operations depends on the market: will buyers be prepared to pay premium prices for quality-graded produce? Many urban customers are more demanding of quality than are rural customers.
Selection and grading in a small packing house are best done by human eye and by hand, assisted by sizing rings or gauges (Figure 7.6).
7.2.5 Waxing. The application of wax or similar coating to enhance appearance and limit water loss from produce requires specialized equipment and has little relevance to small-scale packing.
Figure 7.3 Spraying produce using hand-operated knapsack pump must continue to stage of run-off These bananas will dry in perforated tray
7.2.6 Packaging. Packaging in small-scale operations means the filling of marketing containers by hand (Chapter 6). Machines are used to pack durable produce like potatoes and apples in big packing houses, but they are expensive and not suitable for small volumes of different products. There are various methods of packing:
* loose-fill jumble pack is used where there is no advantage to size-grading; weighing is necessary (Figure 7.7);
* multilayer pattern pack has size-graded produce sold by count of the produce: citrus, apples, etc. (Figure 7.8);
* multilayer size-graded pack used in mechanical packing has separator trays between layers; sold on per-box basis;
* single-layer packs for high-value produce may have each piece wrapped in tissue or placed in a divider holding it alone (Figure 7.9); sold on per-box basis.
7.2.7 Special treatments after packing. Special post-packing treatments are applied to certain crops, but this is more common in large-scale operations for urban and export markets. The principal treatments are:
* Fumigation
The treatment is to control insect pests, such as fruit fly. It is a compulsory requirement for the importation of produce into many countries and requires specialized equipment and skilled operators.
* Initiation of fruit ripening
This takes several days and requires treatment of the packed fruit with ethylene gas in insulated, temperature-controlled stores. The costs are high and thus limited to large operations.
* Degreening of citrus fruit
Citrus fruits grown in the tropics will remain green when ripe unless subjected to low night temperatures. They will, however, develop their normal natural colour if artificially degreened by an ethylene treatment like that initiating ripening; it is not often done in small packing houses.
Figure 7.5 Sorting and packing stand is simply made for small-scale operations and gets work off the floor Incoming produce goes into the sorting bin, then into the packing bin and finally into containers held on shelf (Adapted from Improvement of post-harvest fresh fruits and vegetables handling, FAO/AFMA, 1986)
Figure 7.6 Sizing rings are used for grading round produce. The hand-held model (a) comes in various sizes. The multi-size model (b) can be fixed to a packing stand
7.2.8 Assembly of packed produce for dispatch. Time is an important factor in the marketing of fresh produce; delays add to losses. Once produce has been packed, it should be dispatched to market as soon as possible. Therefore the packing-house management should give high priority to transportation arrangements.
In small-scale operations, however, it may take time to assemble a full load; so when packed produce takes time to accumulate, every effort must be made to prevent its deterioration. Attention must be given to the following:
* packed containers must be protected from the sun and rain; heat and water cause rapid deterioration of produce and seriously weaken cardboard boxes;
* packed boxes must be handled carefully during stacking in order to avoid damaging the contents; damage to produce promotes water loss and decay;
* packed containers awaiting transport must be stacked so as to get ventilation; overheating leads to rapid deterioration.
Losses of fresh produce during packing operations can be minimized if produce is:
* kept as cool as possible;
* kept dry;
* protected from injury;
* kept moving quickly to market.
7.3 Planning a packing house
When seeking a location for a packing house, the following must be considered:
* is it accessible to the production areas, the proposed markets and transport routes?
* is labour available?
* are services available, e.g. electricity, water, telephone, etc.?
Before the location is decided upon, the water to be used for washing produce should be checked for quality, especially if drawn from rivers, streams or standing bodies, to ensure that it is not polluted by sewage, factory effluents, pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers.
7.3.1 Site characteristics. When the general location has been chosen, the following should be observed:
* the site should be level and, if possible, sheltered from exposure to strong winds;
* if it is to be a permanent packing operation, the site should have room for expansion.
* there must be room for the movement and parking of the largest number and size of vehicles expected to use the site; roadways must be at least 3.5 m wide;
* drainage must be adequate to cope with rain runoff and the water used in packing operations;
* the site should lend itself to security arrangements: fencing, watchmen, etc.
7.4 Layout, construction and equipment
Small-scale packing houses are likely to be handling a variety of crops at any one time and over a period of time. Where the volumes handled are relatively small, the layout of buildings and equipment should be simple and flexible.
7.4.1 Layout. The design will be influenced by the space available. In general, a single-level building with a receiving area at one end and a dispatching area at the other will be the most convenient arrangement. This plan separates the reception area, which will be dirty, from the packing and dispatching activities, thus reducing the risk of contamination of sorted and packed produce. It should also avoid congestion and confusion between arriving and departing vehicles (Figure 7.10). If the dimensions and shape of the site are restricted, a U-shaped layout with reception and dispatch areas beside each other is possible, but it cannot be recommended as it will certainly lead to problems of contamination and congestion, let alone problems of any future expansion.
The area of the packing house should be adequate for the easy movement of produce through three stages.
Reception. This area controls the receiving, sorting and cleaning of produce, including washing, when necessary. It is likely to be dirty with soil, dust and decaying plant material.
Ideally it should be separated (by doors, for example) from the other activities in order to limit the contamination of cleaned, sorted and packed produce.
Preparation and packing. This section will include facilities for special treatments, including drying facilities for produce washed or treated or both. The main activity will be the packing of the cleaned produce, with selection and grading facilities, if needed.
There should also be space for the storage and assembly of packing materials in dry conditions.
The whole area should be protected from the weather, but with good ventilation and lighting. The selection, grading and packing areas should be kept clean and dry.
Figure 7.10 A small-scale packing house handling a variety of produce could look like this plan
Dispatch. This activity should be located next to the packing operation but should be kept completely clear of permanent equipment. It must be large enough to provide temporary storage of packed produce and still permit unrestricted movement of workers and produce being shifted.
The dispatch area must be clean and well ventilated.
Any separate office or quality-control activity would probably be located here.
7.4.2 Construction. The building materials and type of construction will be governed by the crops to be handled, expected volume, the market to be catered for and the financing available. Small-scale operations can be successful in relatively simple and inexpensive structures. The principal requirements are:
* adequate overhead protection from sun and rain. This will be helped by a wide roof overhang of at least one metre all around;
* good ventilation but protection from wind-blown rain and dust. This can usually be provided by walls which leave a wide ventilation space beneath the overhanging roof;
* hard, level flooring for safe and easy movement of people and produce.
For small-scale, on-the-farm packing, a simple structure made from cheap local materials (such as bamboo, bush poles, dried grass or other thatch) may be adequate. Such a structure may have a relatively short life, but this factor will be offset by its cost and ease of repair or replacement. If sufficient water is available, walls and roof made of dried plant materials can be periodically soaked to cool the interior of the structure.
A more durable small packing house can be built of a wooden frame with roof and walls of corrugated sheet metal over a concrete floor. In areas of strong sunlight, the heat generated in sheet-metal buildings is extreme, affecting workers and produce. If sheet metal must be used, a wide ventilation gap should be left between walls and roof, the roof itself having a wide overhang. Building walls may not be necessary if the roof is sufficiently extensive to protect produce and workers from sun and rain, and if windblown dust and rain are not problems.
Permanent packing houses should have non-slip concrete floors laid with a fall to drainage channels for easy cleaning. An antidusting surface treatment of concrete is an advantage.
Packing houses, except for those built for big commercial operations, should be free from fixed equipment installations. This allows the maximum flexibility for changing the layout as demanded by varying volumes of produce and a variety of crops.
7.4.3 Equipment. The equipment needed will be specific to each packing house, according to the scale of operations and crops handled. It will be simple and much of it can be made locally. It should be movable, and this means that concrete washing tanks should be avoided.
* Bins or trays manageable by one person are a convenient means of moving produce up to the point of packing. They can be of wood or of plastic, ideally of high-density polythene. Plastic containers are more expensive than wood, but they are easier to keep clean and should last longer (Figure 7.11). Several containers can be moved at one time.
* Push-carts can be any sort of two- or four-wheeled trucks like those used in markets or factories.
* Roller conveyors, supported on stands about 75 cm high, are ideal for the movement of bins or trays through the various stages; they can also be used for loading and unloading vehicles where containers have to be handled individually.
* Mechanized moving-belt conveyors can be used but are expensive and better suited to large operations.
* Hand-pushed lift trucks (Figure 7.12) are valuable in larger packing houses where mechanized means are required for handling unit loads on pallets (Figure 7.13); these cannot, however, be used for lifting loaded pallets on to vehicles; to do so, requires that the loading bay be raised to the height of truck beds or that a mechanical hoist be available for loading.
* Motorized forklift trucks (Figure 7.14) are used in large packing houses for moving palletized loads.
Figure 7.11 Polythene crates are costly but durable
When empty (a), they nest and save space in storage or transit. When filled, they stack neatly and firmly (b) if every other crate is turned in the direction opposite to that below so that crates do not nest and cannot crush contents
7.4.4 Selection, grading and packing. A final selection of produce immediately before it is packed should remove any unmarketable pieces which may have passed earlier sorting. Where small volumes of produce are dealt with by hand, a simple stand is adequate for selection, grading and packing (Figure 7.5). The stand illustrated can be made to any convenient length or duplicated if larger volumes of produce are handled.
Experienced workers can select produce and often size-grade it by eye or by simple gauges, hand-held or fixed (Figure 7.6).
Selected and graded produce is placed in the packing bin, then packed into containers placed on the shelf. Packed containers then move to the dispatch assembly area.
7.4.5 Additional equipment
Weighing. Much produce is still bought and sold by weight, so most packing houses will require some means of weighing produce. Many types of scales are made, and it is best to study the need and the types of scales available before deciding which is most suitable.
Figure 7.12 Hand-operated pallet truck can be used on level concrete floors
Figure 7.13 Wooden pallets of standard size can support several boxes or sacks of produce
Figure 7.14 Mechanized forklift truck can carry palletized produce in packing house and load transport vehicles
Figures 7.12, 1.13 and 7.14 reproduced from Wholesale fruit and vegetable warehouses: guides for layout and design. USDA Marketing Research Report No. 467. 1966.
Washing. Washing of produce can be done in fresh running water using a galvanized tank of the kind shown in Figure 7.15. Produce that floats can be moved along the tank by water flowing from the inlet pipe, perforated on one side, across the end of the tank. The vertical baffle near the outlet end will help to ensure that all produce in the tank is properly washed.
Drying. Produce washed or treated with fungicide needs to be dried before packing. In a small packing house this can be done on a drying rack or table made of wooden slats or plastic-covered wire mesh (Figure 21). Where on-the-farm packing is done, the drying table can readily be made from bamboo or bush poles.
Where a fungicide is applied from a knapsack sprayer after washing, this can be done on the drying rack, and the produce then left to dry before packing.
Figure 7.15 Tank for washing produce can be made of galvanized sheet steel
Water entering under pressure through perforated pipe will move floating produce along tank. The baffle near drain pipe helps to circulate water through the produce
7.5 Packing-house management
The effective management of packing houses requires a high level of efficiency in coordinating the technical, organizational and commercial aspects of operations. Errors and delays affecting any part of the operations will be reflected in growers' returns. Operations should continue throughout the year if it is economic to do so.
7.5.1 Meeting market requirements. Management should be able to advise and instruct both growers and packing-house staff in order to achieve the most efficient operations and high-quality output for the best possible returns.
7.5.2 Procurement and control. A reliable knowledge of the size and arrival times of produce crops to the packing house is essential to its efficient operation. Pickup of harvested produce may be arranged by the packing house. Growers sending produce to a central packing house should be aware of the control of quality and the standards observed. The quality of packed produce must also be controlled in order to reduce the possibility of disputes during marketing.
7.5.3 Supplies of packing materials. Estimates of the coming year's needs must be made in advance. Early arrangements should be made with suppliers to obtain the most advantageous prices and delivery dates.
Accurate stock control must be observed so that supplies do not run out during packing operations.
7.5.4 Disposal of low-grade produce. The selection and grading of produce for market will always result in some substandard pieces. They may have a certain value but should be disposed of to the best advantage of the packing house. The management must also know how much produce is a total loss. The disposal of both the low-grade produce and the total-loss produce must be accounted for.
7.5.5 Staffing. The staffing of the packing house must be adequate for its efficient operation but with attention to labour costs. This means the efficient deployment of labour and the need for adequate supervision.
Permanent staff may include a manager, clerks, mechanics and maintenance workers, drivers and some skilled packers. Peak periods will require temporary workers.
7.5.6 Staff training. The manager's responsibility for all packing-house activities requires that he be technically qualified and able to train his foremen. He must also ensure that in-service training is provided for the packing workers.
7 5.7 Grower training. When a packing house is supplied by several growers, management should ensure that they are informed as to how they can achieve the quality standards set by the market. Cooperation with post-harvest extension workers is desirable. This may include formal training out of season but will be most effective if farm visits are made when harvesting and packing-house activities are in progress.
7.5.8 Accounting and costing of operations. Agreements must be made with growers as to payments for produce, taking into account the quality control requirements. The cost of running the packing house must be estimated per kg of produce throughput to enable costs to be minimized and growers' returns maximized.
7.5.9 Documentation and accounting. The manager is responsible for seeing that accurate records are maintained and proper accounts prepared. This is fundamental to the success of the packing house as a business.
8. Transport
8.1 Importance to marketing
Transportation is a big and often the most important factor in the marketing of fresh produce. Ideally, transport would take produce from the grower directly to the consumer, as in many developing countries. In more complex marketing systems (those serving towns, cities or distant countries)' the cost of transport contributes significantly to the price paid by the consumer, and sometimes exceeds the value of the raw product.
Losses directly attributed to transport conditions can be high. The goal of every person concerned with transport should be that the produce be kept in the best possible condition during transport and that the haulage of produce be quick and efficient. To this end, produce should be properly packaged and properly loaded on a suitable vehicle.
8.2 Causes of loss
The damage and loss incurred during non-refrigerated transport are caused primarily by mechanical damage and by overheating.
8.2.1 Mechanical damage. Damage of this type occurs for many reasons, including:
* careless handling of packed produce during loading and unloading;
* vibration (shaking) of the vehicle, especially on bad roads;
* fast driving and poor condition of the vehicle;
* poor stowage, which allows packages in transit to sway; the stow may collapse (Figure 8.1);
* packages stacked too high; the movement of produce within a package increases in relation to its height in the stack.
8.2.2 Overheating. This can occur not only from external sources but also from heat generated by the produce within the package itself.
Overheating promotes natural breakdown and decay, and increases the rate of water loss from produce.
The causes of overheating include:
* the use of closed vehicles without ventilation;
* close-stow stacking patterns blocking the movement of air between and through packages, thus hindering the dispersal of heat;
* the lack of adequate ventilation of the packages themselves;
* exposure of the packages to the sun while awaiting transport or while trucks are queuing to unload at their destination.
<section>5</section>
8.3 Reduction of losses during transport
The risk of deterioration of produce during transport can be reduced in several ways.
8.3.1 Trucks used to transport fresh produce. Most fresh produce is now moved in road vehicles, with lesser amounts by sea, air or inland waterways. The vehicles in most common use are open pick-ups or bigger trucks, either open or enclosed. The use of road vehicles is likely to increase, so users should give attention to the following:
* closed vehicles without refrigeration should not be used to carry fresh produce except on very short journeys, such as local deliveries from farmers or wholesalers to nearby retailers;
* open-sided or half-boarded trucks can be fitted with a roof on a frame. The open sides can be fitted with canvas curtains which can be rolled up or moved aside in sections to allow loading or unloading at any point around the vehicle. Such curtains can protect the produce from the elements but still allow for ventilation. Where pilfering is a problem, the sides and rear of the truck must be enclosed in wire mesh;
* a second, white-painted roof can be fixed as a radiation shield 8 or 10 cm above the main roof; this will reflect the sun's heat and help to keep produce cool;
* for the ventilation of long-distance vehicles, more elaborate air intakes can be fitted in conjunction with louvres, to ensure a positive air flow through the load;
* refrigerated trucks or road, rail or sea containers may be used for long journeys, but the cost of such transport makes it uneconomical for small-scale operations.
8.3.2 Handling and stowage practices. Although the shape and condition of trucks are important factors in fresh produce transportation, the loading and stowing methods in vehicles are pertinent to damage and loss:
* the best loading factor must be achieved, that is the maximum load that can be carried economically under satisfactory technical conditions: a stable and well-ventilated load;
* the size and design of packages should give adequate levels of ventilation of contents with the minimum of wasted space, and the packages should be strong enough to protect the contents (Figure 8.2);
* loading and unloading of vehicles should be properly supervised to prevent careless handling of packages; loading aids such as trolleys, roller conveyors, pallet or forklift trucks should be used where possible to reduce the handling of individual packages;
* stowage should be carefully done to avoid collapse of the stow during transport; packages should not be stacked higher than the maximum recommended by the maker, otherwise the bottom layers may collapse under the weight of those above
* packed produce should be protected from sun and rain at all times including during loading and unloading (Figure 8.3);
* packages should be loaded on dunnage (pieces of lumber or slatted racks) on the beds of vehicles, or on pallets in order to allow the circulation of air around stacks during transport;
* if the load is to be distributed to several locations, packages should be loaded in reverse order to that in which they will be unloaded, i.e. last on, first off; at the same time the load should be distributed evenly on the vehicle.
Although every care may be taken to observe all the above precautions, the standards of driving remain a difficult problem to overcome. In many cases, drivers are induced to speed in order to make more money for themselves or their employers. Whenever possible, only experienced and responsible drivers should be employed.
8.3.3 Other modes of transport. Fresh produce is transported by many other means, from head-loads to air-freighting. In all cases, the same conditions should be observed. Produce must be:
* kept as cool as possible;
* kept dry;
* moved to market as quickly as possible.
8.3.4 Rail transport. In some countries a large amount of produce is carried by rail.
The advantages are:
* transport damage to produce while moving is slight as compared with that from haulage over rough roads;
* costs are lower than transport by road.
Rail transport, however, requires extra handling since road transport is needed to and from the rail journey; transport by road alone usually is a door-to-door service.
8.3.5 Water transport
Inland. Waterway transport is used in some countries to move produce to markets. Much of the produce carried in this way is packed in locally made crates or sacks. The vessels employed are often mixed passenger-cargo craft, and no special handling is provided for fresh produce.
Sea. Short-distance transport of fresh produce in small ships without refrigeration is common in countries of island communities (e.g. the Philippines). Ships often accommodate passengers and general cargo, and no special provision is made for fresh produce, which may be stowed in unventilated holds. Losses are high, owing to rough handling by porters, inadequate packaging and overheating in unventilated holds or near engine rooms.
There is much room for improvement in this mode of transport. A model for organized and efficient sea transport is the refrigerated shipment of commercial crops such as bananas, although a modest investment by the small-scale shipper could greatly improve performance.
8.3.6 Air freight. As with shipping, the international trade in the air-freighting of high-value exotic crops is generally well organized. In some countries where road links are poor (e.g. Papua New Guinea), produce is carried by air from production areas to urban markets. Costs are high and losses often heavy because of:
* poor, non-standard packages;
* careless handling and exposure to the elements at airports;
* consignments left behind in favour of passengers;
* flight delays owing to bad weather or breakdowns;
* intermittent refrigeration followed by exposure to high temperatures;
* relatively small produce shipments.
Even though changes are made in packaging and handling, it is unlikely that the overall situation will improve much until road links are established between producers and consumers.
9. Post-harvest treatments
9.1 Special uses
The routine packing operations, such as cleaning, selection, grading and packing of produce are discussed in Section 7. Apart from these, some crops which are seasonal and subject to long-term storage, or are highly perishable and transported over long distances to market, require special treatments in order to slow deterioration and minimize losses.
These treatments may be applied before, during or after packing and are supplementary to the routine measures, such as temperature and moisture control, which aim to reduce losses in all fresh produce.
9.2 Curing
The term "curing" is applied to the measures used to prepare starchy staple root crops and onions for long-term storage. The method of curing root crops is, however, quite different from that used on onions.
9.2.1 Root crop curing. The curing of root and tuber crops replaces and strengthens damaged areas of corky skin, restoring protection against water loss and infection by decay organisms. The principal crop subjected to curing is the Irish potato, but curing is also effective in some tropical root crops.
Although details vary from crop to crop (Table 3), the following conditions must always be observed:
* the roots and tubers must be kept at an appropriate temperature, normally somewhat higher than ambient, in order to stimulate new skin growth;
* the atmosphere must be kept moist but without free water on the surface of the roots or tubers; no new skin will be formed in dry air on injured surfaces;
* some ventilation is needed for new skin growth, but an excessive air flow will dry the atmosphere and cause a drop in temperature;
* the temperature must be kept steady; if it falls, water will condense on the surface of the roots and tubers and will encourage bacterial soft rot.
TABLE 3. Conditions suggested for the curing of roots and tubers
Crop Temperature (°C) Relative humidity (%) Curing time (days*)
Irish potato 13-17 above 85 7-15
Sweet potato 27-33 above 90 5-7
Yam** 32-40 above 90 1-4
Taro (dasheen) 30 35 above 95 4-7
Cassava 30 35 above 80 4-7
* In practice, at least sewn days should be allowed for wring.
** Dioscorea alata and D. rotundata
Because all root and tuber crops are damaged to some extent during harvest and handling, curing must be carried out as soon as possible. This can be done by limiting ventilation, thus allowing the temperature to rise enough to promote curing. At the same time the air will become moist owing to the normal production of water by the roots and high rate of evaporation from injuries (Figure 9.1).
The conditions for Irish potato storage are we!! established; but those for tropical root crops are mostly based on experimental data. The storage life of sweet potatoes and of aroids like taro and cocoyam is usually rather short owing to their susceptibility to post-harvest decay. Cassava is subject to rapid internal discoloration and decay.
9.2.2 Curing dry bulb onions. The curing of dry bulb onions, carried out immediately after harvest, is a drying-out process. Under dry, warm conditions harvested onions are left in the field for a few days until the green tops, outer skins and roots are fully dried. Under wet conditions, it may be necessary to dry onions on racks or trays under cover.
The curing of onions is necessary because:
* the necks of onions are very sensitive to decay if they remain wet, especially if the green tops are cut off before harvest;
* drying the outer skins of the bulbs reduces decay and water loss;
* roots damaged during harvesting are a common entry point for decay unless they are dried quickly.
Figure. 9.1 This simple method of curing yams damaged in harvesting or handling has been used in West Africa
If properly carried out, this technique will provide the necessary warm and moist atmosphere to aid in healing skin damage. It can be adapted for other root crops (Reproduced from Careful storage of yams: some basic principles to reduce losses. Commonwealth Secretariat, London)
Cutting off the green tops of bulb onions is not recommended for small-scale producers because it greatly increases the risk of losses from decay if the bulbs cannot be dried quickly under controlled conditions.
In large-scale commercial production, where the green tops are cut off mechanically before harvest, drying is often carried out using artificial heat with forced ventilation. This technique is not economical for small-scale production.
Field-dried onions can be stored up to two months under ambient conditions in well-ventilated trays on pallets or in a field windbreak. Dried onions should never be allowed to come into contact with damp soil.
9.3 Inhibition of sprouting
Sprouting of both potatoes and onions is a problem in temperate countries, where they are stored for up to eight months. Long-term storage may not be necessary in warmer climates where growers may produce more than one crop a year.
Two methods are employed to reduce sprouting:
* the selection of varieties with long dormancy periods; suppliers of seed and planting material can be asked to provide information on storage characteristics of varieties produced under local conditions;
* the use of chemical sprout suppressants for potatoes and onions to be stored. Some suppressants have to be applied to the growing crop before harvest (e.g. maleic hydrazide). Others such as tecnazene (which has both suppressant and fungicidal properties) are mixed as a dust or granules with potatoes as they are loaded into store. Suppressants are rarely used except in large-scale production and storage; they should be used only after consultation with extension workers. Little is known about the effectiveness of sprout suppressants when used on tropical root and tuber crops.
9.4 Fungicide application
Post-harvest application of fungicides to control decay is used on several major crops which are either stored or undergo long periods of transport to distant markets (citrus, bananas, apples, etc.). Fungicides are normally used only on produce which is washed and drained dry before packing (see Chapter 7).
9.4.1. Application method
Spray or mist. For small-scale operations application is by hand-held knapsack sprayer (Figure 7.3) or for large-scale commercial operations by a mechanized spray rig in conjunction with a moving belt or roller conveyor. Produce is sprayed to runoff to ensure complete coverage.
Drenching. A simple mechanized recirculating system pumps fungicide in a cascade over produce passing beneath it on a belt or roller conveyor (Figure 7.4). This system has no spray nozzles to wear out or become blocked, and the high flow rate through the pump keeps the mixture agitated. It may be necessary to add a non-foaming wetting agent in the suspension to counteract possible drag-out of the fungicide if foaming occurs.
Dipping. Where small quantities of produce are to be treated, the fungicide mixture is made up in a small container and produce is dipped by hand. Excess fungicide is allowed to drain back into the bath (Figure 7.2). The fungicide suspension must be agitated constantly. Workers dipping by hand may develop skin reaction to some fungicides, and they should be supplied with rubber gloves for their protection.
Smoke or fumigant. Fungicide can be applied in the form of dust or vapour in closed containers (e.g. diphenyl wraps or pads in citrus boxes), or in sealed bulk stores (e.g. tecnazene in potato stores). Such treatments are relatively rare. Bulk-store fumigation requires skilled operation and is normally carried out by contractors.
Hot water (fungicide treatment). Although hot-water dips have known to be effective for the control of post-harvest decay of some tropical fruits, the treatment has not been widely adopted because of the difficulty of applying it on a commercial scale. A heated fungicide dip has been shown to control anthracnose and has been used commercially in Australia. The operation requires close technical management and allows very little margin for error. It is not generally applicable to small-scale production.
9.4.2 Controls on fungicide treatment. The use of fungicides after harvest is normally subject to more stringent regulation than would be applied to their use on growing crops. The range of chemicals available for post-harvest treatment of fresh produce is small, with strict limitations on both the concentrations used and the permitted levels of residues on treated produce at the retail or processing stage.
Users of post-harvest fungicides must observe that the fungicide for any crop is:
* permissible (i.e. not prohibited) for use on the crop after harvest;
* effective in controlling the post-harvest diseases of that crop;
* used in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions and at their recommended concentrations (excessive residues on produce may lead to its rejection);
* agitated continuously during use to prevent its settling out.
Those in charge of operations must make sure that employees using fungicides observe all the precautions applicable to their use and that they wear the necessary protective clothing.
10. Storage
10.1 Controlled conditions
The term "storage", as now applied to fresh produce, is almost automatically assumed to mean the holding of fresh fruit and vegetables under controlled conditions. Although this includes the large-scale storage of some major crops, such as potatoes, to meet a regular continuous demand and provide a degree of price stabilization, it also meets the demands of populations of developed countries and of the richer inhabitants of developing countries, providing year-round availability of various local and exotic fruits and vegetables.
In many developing countries, however, where seasonally produced plant foods are held back from sale and released gradually, storage in a controlled environment is not possible because of the cost and the lack of infrastructural development and of maintenance and managerial skills. Even in developed countries, however, there are still many people who, for their own consumption, preserve and store fresh produce by traditional methods.
10.2 Storage potential
Much fresh produce (i.e. that which is most perishable) cannot be stored without refrigeration, but the possibilities for extending the storage life of even the most durable fresh produce under ambient conditions are limited.
10.2.1 Organs of survival. The organs of survival which form the edible parts of many crops such as Irish potatoes, yams, beets, carrots and onions have a definite period of dormancy after harvest and before they resume growth, at which time their food value declines. This period of dormancy can usually be extended to give the longest possible storage if appropriate conditions are provided. This factor is called the storage potential.
It is important to recognize the variation in the storage potential of different cultivars of the same crop. Experienced local growers and seed suppliers can usually provide information on this subject.
10.2.2 Edible reproductive parts. These are largely confined to the fruits or seeds of leguminous plants (peas and beans). In their fresh condition these products have a brief storage life which can be only slightly extended by refrigeration. They can also be dried, and then are called pulses. Pulses have a long storage life, provided they are kept dry, and do not present a storage problem of the sort affecting fresh produce.
10.2.3 Fresh fruit and vegetables. These include the leafy green vegetables, fleshy fruits and modified flower parts (e.g. cauliflower, pineapple). The storage potential of these is very limited under ambient conditions. They quickly deteriorate because of their fast respiration rates, which cause rapid heat buildup and the depletion of their high moisture content.
Traditional methods of preservation are sun-drying or simple domestic processing into conserves (with sugar) and pickles (with brine or vinegar). Most fresh fruit and vegetables have a storage life of only a few days under even the best environmental conditions.
10.3 Factors affecting storage life
The natural limits to the post-harvest life of all types of fresh produce are severely affected by other biological and environmental conditions:
10.3.1 Temperature. An increase in temperature causes an increase in the rate of natural breakdown of all produce as food reserves and water content become depleted. The cooling of produce will extend its life by slowing the rate of breakdown.
10.3.2 Water loss. High temperature and injuries to produce can greatly increase the loss of water from stored produce beyond that unavoidably lost from natural causes. Maximum storage life can be achieved by storing only undamaged produce at the lowest temperature tolerable by the crop.
10.3.3 Mechanical damage. Damage caused during harvesting and subsequent handling increases the rate of deterioration of produce and renders it liable to attacks by decay organisms. Mechanical damage to root crops will cause heavy losses owing to bacterial decay and must be remedied by curing the roots or tubers before storage. Curing is a wound-healing process discussed in Chapter 9.
10.3.4 Decay in storage. Decay of fresh produce during storage is mostly caused by the infection of mechanical injuries. Furthermore, many fruits and vegetables are attacked by decay organisms which penetrate through natural openings or even through the intact skin. These infections may be established during the growth of the plant in the field but lie dormant until after harvest, often becoming visible only during storage or ripening.
10.4 Storage structures
10.4.1 Ventilated stores. Naturally ventilated structures can be used for the storage of produce with a long storage potential, such as roots and tubers, pumpkins, onions and hard white cabbage. Such stores must be designed and built specifically for each intended location. Any type of building can be used provided that it allows the free circulation of air through the structure and its contents.
The following essentials must be observed:
* the building should be located at a site where low night temperatures occur over the required storage period;
* it must be oriented to take maximum use of the prevailing wind for ventilation;
* the material covering the roof and walls should provide insulation from the heat of the sun; grass thatch on a bush-pole frame can be very effective, particularly if it is wetted to provide evaporative cooling;
* double-skinned walls will provide better insulation, if cost allows;
* white paint applied to surfaces of man-made materials will help to reflect the heat of the sun;
* the structure should be built in the shade of trees if they do not interfere with the prevailing air flow; beware of bush fires and of trees falling during storms;
* provide ventilation spaces below the floor and between walls and roof to give good air flow;
* if the store is subject to cold night temperatures, fit movable louvres and adjust them to limit the flow of warm air into the store during the day.
These are the basic requirements of a ventilated store. Such stores may be constructed to various levels of sophistication, using, where it is economically acceptable, fan-assisted ventilation controlled by differential thermostats. This type of store is in common use in Europe for the bulk storage of Irish potatoes and onions in locations where external winter conditions make possible the accurate control of the storage temperature.
Simple open-sided, naturally ventilated structures may be used to store seed potatoes at high altitudes in warm climates. They cannot be used for table potatoes, which will turn green, develop a bitter taste, or even become toxic if exposed to light for more than a few hours (Figure 10. 1).
10.4.2 Clamps. These are simple, inexpensive structures used to store root crops, particularly potatoes in Europe and Latin America (Figure 10.2).
The potatoes are placed on a bed of straw I to 3 m wide, but not more than 1.5 m wide in warm climates. A ventilating duct should be placed along the bottom. The piled potatoes are covered with about 20 cm of compacted straw which can subsequently be encased in soil, applied without compaction up to 30 cm deep.
The clamp system can be modified for different climatic conditions. In warm climates extra straw casing may be used instead of soil in order to give added ventilation.
Figure 10.2 This structure. called a clamp, is commonly used for storage of potatoes and other root crops. It is used mostly in temperate regions but is also effective at high elevations m warmer climates
(Reproduced from Principles of potato storage, International Potato Centre, Lima, 1981)
10.4.3 Other simple storage methods. Windbreaks are narrow, wire-mesh, basket-like structures about I m wide and 2 m high, of any convenient length, on a raised wooden base, and are used for short-term storage of dried onions in the field. The onions are covered on top with a 30 cm layer of straw, which is in turn held down by a polythene sheet fastened to the wire mesh. The windbreak is built at right angles to the prevailing wind to obtain maximum drying and ventilation.
Onions can also be woven into plaits on twine and hung in a cool dry place, where they will keep for several months (Figure 10.3).
10.4.4 Refrigerated and controlled-atmosphere storage. For large-scale commercial operations, refrigerated storage may be used in a cold-chain operation to carry regular consignments from production areas to urban markets and retailers. This can be a highly complex operation requiring expert organization and management.
Cold storage can also be used for long-term storage of seasonal crops such as potatoes and onions. The storage life of some fruits, such as apples, can be extended by combining refrigeration with a controlled environment consisting of a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
These last are expensive operations with high maintenance and running costs, and demand skilled and experienced management. They have relatively little application to small-scale production in developing countries.
11. Preservation methods for fruit, vegetables and root crops
11.1 Processing avoids waste
In most countries, the production of many perishable food crops is seasonal, making them available only during short periods of the year. During this short time, they are produced in greater quantity than the market can absorb, so the surplus of many of these crops must be processed and preserved to avoid wastage of the food and loss of income to the grower.
Modern methods of food storage and preservation, such as refrigeration and freezing, are now widely used in developed countries. These methods are, however, rare in many of the developing countries, but surpluses of many seasonal local crops can be preserved for later use by various processing methods requiring only simple and inexpensive equipment.
11.2 Principles of fresh-produce processing
Chapter 4 describes how fresh produce deteriorates and decays after harvest owing to the activities of:
Enzymes. These complex chemicals are present in very small amounts in all living material. All living activities are under their control; they continue to function after harvest, causing a natural breakdown of fresh produce. Enzymes in fresh produce must be destroyed if the processed product is to be stored.
Micro-organisms. These are the moulds, yeasts and bacteria which can attack and decompose both living and dead plants and animals. They are active spoilage agents of preserved produce; if they are not destroyed or inactivated, they can even render it poisonous by their activities.
<section>6</section>
11.3 Processing and preserving methods
To process and preserve fresh produce successfully, the spoilage agents must be destroyed without ruining the nutritional value or palatability of the produce itself.
Unfortunately, fruit, vegetables and root crops are the only natural source of the essential vitamin C in our food. This vitamin is easily destroyed, especially where processing makes use of heat. In order to retain the maximum amount of vitamin C in processed food, it:
* should be used when freshly harvested;
* must not be subjected to long soaking or washing;
* must be processed immediately after preparation;
* should not be treated in copper, iron or chipped pans.
The best methods for small-scale processing are: drying, chemical preservation and heat processing.
11.3.1 Drying. All living materials require water for survival. Fresh produce contains up to 95 percent water and thus is sufficiently moist to support both enzyme activity and growth of micro-organisms. The aim in drying is to reduce the water content of the produce to a level insufficient for enzyme activity or the growth of micro-organisms. The critical level is about 10-15 percent moisture, depending on the commodity. If too much water is removed, the product becomes brittle and is easily shattered.
Produce can be dried by using solar or artificial heat. Solar (sun) drying is cheap but is not so easily controlled as dehydration by more sophisticated means. In some countries, heat from burning agricultural waste is used for drying, as in copra driers, which have also been used for drying root crops.
Drying by direct exposure to the sun has a number of disadvantages:
* Exposure of produce to dust and atmospheric contamination
* Interference from animals and humans
* Insect infestation
* No control of conditions.
Recently much research has gone into the design of solar driers for fresh produce in order to overcome these problems. Solar driers can be:
* direct exposure driers, in which the prepared produce is exposed to the sun in a ventilated cabinet with transparent sides and cover, on an insulated, heat-absorbing base; there is little control of temperature or air flow;
* indirect exposure driers, in which an inclined, insulated heat trap directs a flow of sun-heated air up a tower where produce is exposed on mesh trays; the air flow and temperature con be controlled by louvres at the air inlet and outlet;
* a combination of direct and indirect drying is employed when the walls of the tower of an indirect drier are covered with transparent material so that there is some direct exposure of the drying material to the sun's heat.
The rate of loss of vitamin C from the produce is reduced when the indirect solar drying method is used.
Drying should be as rapid as possible in order to maintain quality and minimize vitamin loss. The rate of drying depends on:
* the exposure of a large surface area of the produce, which speeds drying; most produce should be cut into strips not more than 5 mm thick;
* the temperature should be high enough (50-70 degrees Celsius) to give rapid moisture removal; temperatures over 70 degrees cause discoloration of the product;
* the warm air current must be dry; if it is humid, it cannot absorb moisture from the drying product;
* special treatments may be given to certain types of produce before drying; for example:
1. Fruit and vegetables may be treated with sulphur dioxide before drying in order to prevent enzymatic browning; it also slows breakdown of vitamin C and kills some micro-organisms;
2. Most vegetables except onions and garlic are blanched by dipping them in hot water for a few minutes before drying; this stops the action of enzymes which may not be killed by the sun-drying process;
3. Green vegetables retain their colour better during drying if about 0.25 percent of bicarbonate of soda is added to the blanching water, but this will speed up the loss of vitamin C;
4. Dried cassava forms an important part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Latin America; the dried product may be in the form of chips, granules or flour; in some areas the grated cassava root is fermented for a short time before being dried by artificial heat or sunlight;
5. Dried vegetable products are subject to severe insect infestation, and some may be affected by exposure to light during storage; dried produce must be stored in a very dry atmosphere, in insect-proof containers and away from light. ·
11.3.2 Processing using chemicals. Chemicals used in processing include sugar, salt, vinegar and chemical preservatives such as sodium meta-bisulphite. The principal products are:
Preserves with sugar. This is based on using a high concentration of sugar with fruit pulp or juice to create a product in which it is difficult for moulds and yeasts to grow. It includes:
* Jams and jellies. In these products acidified fruit pulp is boiled with sugar until the cell wall pectins of the fruit form a gel. The final product should contain at least 60 percent sugar. The hot preserve is sealed in sterilized jars to prevent contamination during storage.
* Fruit cheeses. Pulped fruit is sieved and mixed with an equal weight of sugar. The mixture is heated to remove most of the water. It is then spread on trays to cool and dry; then it can be cut into cubes and stored under very dry conditions.
* Fruit drink concentrates. The juice is extracted from heated fruit pulp and made into a syrup with a high sugar concentration. The squash or syrup is put into sterilized bottles, which are heated in a bath at 88 degrees Celsius (simmering) for 20 minutes. The bottles are closed with sterile caps for storage. Drinks are prepared by diluting the concentrate with water.
Pickled vegetables. Young fresh vegetables of many types as well as some fruits can be preserved by pickling in vinegar. The prepared vegetables or fruit are first soaked for a few days in a strong salt solution (brine) and then packed into jars which are then filled with cold vinegar. The vinegar is usually flavoured by steeping the desired spices in it for one or two months. The jars should be closed with plastic-lined covers.
Preservation with salt. This method is usually used for preserving green beans. Young green beans and salt are placed in alternate layers in large glass or earthenware jars, the top layer being of salt. The jars are closed with moisture-proof covers and then they are stored on stands.
Fermented products. In several countries vegetables are subjected to lactic acid fermentation in brine, such as sauerkraut in Germany, made from shredded cabbage, and takuwan in Korea, using radishes. In the Pacific islands, a fermented product is made by burying peeled starchy produce in pits lined with Heliconia or banana leaves. The product, known as masi or ma, is mostly made from breadfruit, but green bananas, cassava roots or taro may also be used.
11.3.3 Heat treatments. For many years fruit and vegetables have been preserved by heat, using canning or bottling methods. The object is to kill the enzymes and micro-organisms by heating the produce in liquid in cans or jars. The containers are then sealed while still hot to prevent contamination of the sterilized contents. Although moist heat inactivates enzymes and kills most micro-organisms, some bacteria, such as Clostridium and Staphylococcus are heat-resistant and are capable of growing and producing poisons in canned or bottled foods. Clostridium produces a toxin which causes botulism, a fatal food poison.
Acid foods, such as fruit, inhibit the growth of Clostridium and prevent the formation of the poison.
Non-acid foods such as peas and beans and almost all vegetables can be preserved only by heat at the high temperatures achieved in steam-pressure vessels. For this reason, heat-processing methods are not recommended for processing any vegetables under small-scale local conditions.
11.3.4 Information about processing. Detailed information on the methods used in fresh-produce processing is normally available from national departments of agriculture or of food technology, through local department advisers or extension officers.
12. Marketing systems
12.1 Operators in the market
There can be many participants in any given marketing system. Here are the main ones.
12.1.1 Farmers. Most small farmers are mainly concerned with the growing of crops, and their awareness of marketing as a tool to increase income is non-existent or is limited to what they learn from other small farmers or from villagers nearby.
To many small farmers, marketing may mean the sale of produce to a trader or its consignment to a commission agent. They would sell directly to consumers or to a wholesale market only if the farm is close to such outlets. As their production increases, farmers acquire other sources and information about marketing systems, but in developing countries very few growers have either sufficient production or sufficient knowledge to take advantage of the marketing choices available.
12.1.2 Traders. The role of traders is essentially to act as the link producer and distributor. They are mostly entrepreneurs whose income depends on matching the supply of produce with the demand of the market. They range from small family groups on a local level to large international companies dealing with export and import of produce in many countries.
The marketing of fruit and vegetables in developing countries is marked by a large number of small traders. They play an indispensable role in the marketing system. Their importance is, however, not always appreciated and their profits are often considered excessive, largely because farmers and government officers are unaware of the traders' costs. The proportion of the retail price that comes to the trader is generally much lower than that received by the farmer.
12.1.3 Commission agents. The role of specialized commission agents is to take produce owned by a farmer or a trader and sell it for the best price possible. They may find a buyer in an organized wholesale market or by direct contact with distributors. The proceeds of the sale, minus deduction for the agreed commission, are then passed back to the former owner. Commissions commonly range from 4 to 10 percent of the price obtained.
The commission system has advantages for the farmer, who is likely to get a higher price than he would if selling to an intermediate trader, even though the farmer carries the risk of loss always present in the marketing of perishables. The farmer's confidence in the agent rests on the knowledge that the agent's income depends on his getting the best deal for the farmer.
12.1.4 Retailers. Market demands for all commodities are essentially determined by retailers, who therefore have great influence on market prices. What the retailer buys reflects the quality and quantity of what he thinks his customers will buy. In most developing countries, the quality of produce varies so widely that sales potential exists for most grades of produce. Farmers and traders should maintain contacts with retailers to be aware of market preferences so that they can arrange production and post-harvest handling practices to provide produce of the desired quality.
The prices paid by retailers will depend on the number of competing buyers in the wholesale market and on the volume of produce available: this is the law of supply and demand. Although retailers try to buy produce at the cheapest possible price, most of them will apply a standard mark-up and thus will obtain their usual profit margin regardless of the wholesale price.
12.2 Types of markets
There are several common types of markets, each filling a specific role.
12.2.1 Farmer markets. These markets are simple retail operations where farmers sell produce directly to consumers. They occur in towns or cities and may be in a covered market hall or on an open street, on a daily or a weekly basis. Such markets have histories of dozens or hundreds of years.
By selling directly to consumers, farmers can ask and get much higher prices (and in cash) than they would by selling to traders. To deal with retail customers takes time, however, and moves only small quantities of produce. Losses can be high from customers' pinching and prodding of produce, which then must be discarded if sufficiently damaged. The industrious farmer can spend his time more profitably elsewhere.
12.2.2 Assembly markets. An assembly market is much like a farmer market except that producers deal with traders instead of directly with consumers. It is a farmer market on a wholesale level. Traders find assembly markets convenient in saving themselves expense and time they would need to travel to farms to collect produce.
Assembly markets tend to start from a natural need by buyers and sellers, and their location will usually be determined by proximity to good transport, whether road, rail or water, so that traders can quickly move their purchases onward to markets.
The operation of an assembly market can be simple, but a successful one will soon attract people providing services such as weighing, packaging, loading equipment and perhaps even banking. The building of a marketing hall will move the buying and selling under cover and out of the weather, and may attract other services like packing and storing.
Assembly markets can be operated by farmers through some cooperative association, by municipal or central government bodies or by a number of large traders. There is, however, the danger that sectional interests taking control of operations can put other groups or persons at a disadvantage.
12.2.3 Wholesale markets. The wholesale market provides a convenient point for the gathering of large amounts of produce from many sources and for its division into small assortments to meet the needs of retailers. In developing countries, incoming produce is most commonly owned by a trader or may be consigned by a large farmer or a cooperative, whereas in developed countries most produce is consigned by farmers.
The need for a wholesale market arises naturally as the population of a town increases and thus becomes remote from producing farms. The simplest wholesale markets exist in small towns, where incomes are relatively low. They may function only weekly, where farmers or traders bring in only small quantities of produce of every size and quality. Facilities may be minimal, and prices correspondingly low. Retail merchants may compete with private customers and will generally get better prices because of bulk purchasing. Many such retailers are street hawkers, though others may operate stalls in the market itself, keeping longer hours than does the wholesale operation. Such combination markets are common in African towns.
Many large cities in Asia and Latin America have reached the stage of economic development where they can benefit from a wholesale market exclusively for fruit and vegetables. Higher incomes in cities always result in greater demand for fresh, high-quality produce, and retail operations reflect what customers expect in quality and variety. The size and diversity of a central wholesale market mean that it can satisfy the needs of retailers and their customers.
The influence of a wholesale market extends beyond its location. It supplies produce to retailers in surrounding districts and to other wholesalers in more distant places. Prices set by supply and demand at the wholesale market also have an importance beyond the market itself as they become a reference point for the setting of prices for transactions of farmers, traders and consumers on other markets. Wholesale markets may also play an additional role as the receiving and marketing centre for imported produce.
12.2.4 Retail outlets. As cities grow and exercise more economic power, the trend in retailing is away from street stalls and hawkers and toward fixed shops and supermarkets.
Hawkers. Although they have been part of market systems for centuries, hawkers are actively discouraged in many countries as being traffic hazards and as not contributing much to overall marketing schemes. Hawkers do, however, benefit lower-income consumers by selling at low prices much low-quality produce which might otherwise be a dead loss. Any reduction in their numbers should be the result of more efficiency and better prices in retail outlets and not of official harassment.
Public markets. Public retail markets have varying degrees of importance, ranging from being the major source of produce for consumers to being a minor supplement to its sale in shops. The usually low prices reflect low overhead and operating costs, but the confinement of produce retailing to central market districts means that customers must travel some distance to market. The emergence of small fixed shops will eventually divert customers away from central markets, even if they must pay higher prices.
Retail shops. Prices of produce in retail shops reflect a greater variety of goods of a higher standard of quality than those found in public markets. Competition between retailers is based mainly on attracting customers by concentration on shop decoration, presentation of produce and personal contact between staff and customers. Such shops are likely to be situated in or near residential neighbourhoods.
Supermarkets. Retail shops can efficiently and quickly turn over large quantities of produce but, with increasing costs that inevitably follow economic development in communities, retail shops are pressed to sell ever greater quantities in order to retain profitability. Thus supermarkets with their greater financial resources can move into produce-selling at a relatively small increase in overhead costs. Supermarkets can and do negotiate directly with growers for supplies of fresh produce, thus eliminating middleman costs entirely and selling produce at prices matching those of farmer markets. In developing countries, however, produce in supermarkets is generally more expensive than in open markets, largely because of packaging, high-quality produce, and the attraction for the usually affluent customer of easy parking and one-stop shopping.
13. Marketing strategies
13.1 The goals
The aim of a commercial marketing strategy is to sell a commodity at the time and place that can bring the highest possible return. To develop a marketing strategy for fruit and vegetables is much more complex than for, say, manufactured goods because of the fragility and perishability of fresh produce. These factors place limits on the time produce can be held, the distance it can be moved and the handling costs that customers will be expected to bear. Such market uncertainties bring a speculative element into trading activities and thus the attendant risk of market manipulation.
Since trading of fruit and vegetables in most countries operates as a free market, the law of supply and demand regulates the market price. This means that the price will increase if the supply falls below market demand and will decrease if the supply exceeds the demand.
13.2 Supply of produce
The supply of a commodity is calculated from the total quantity of produce that is grown and from the period during which it is available. The quantity on a particular market is determined by the area under cultivation, the productivity of the crop and the amount of that crop brought in from other areas.
The supply of most commodities moving to markets in developing countries usually varies over a year, but there is considerable potential for change by manipulating both production and transport factors to level and extend the supply.
13.2.1 Changing production volume. Changes in fruit and vegetable growing patterns will best come about through market forces. For example, when a market is under-supplied with a product, the resulting high prices will encourage farmers to increase the area planted with this crop and decrease that of a low-return commodity. Such changes can occur more readily with annual crops like vegetables than with fruit from trees which take years to come into production.
To bring about changes in cultivated crops is more difficult in farming communities that are poorly educated and have little concern with marketing. The opposite can happen if farmers become too conscious of market trends and readily change crops if they have a poor market return. This can start a lopsided cycle of overproduction and falling prices followed by underproduction and rising prices and so on.
13.2.2 Transport to other markets. Problems of over- and under-supply can be more quickly balanced by transporting produce between districts with surplus or scarcity. A knowledge of prices is essential for profitable trade between such districts, and this a strong argument for the establishment of an organized market information system.
Interdistrict trading can be organized on a long-term basis using information on annual market trends or in response to a short-run supply in a market. For example, a severe storm can so damage a crop that supplies to local markets are severely cut and prices rise quickly. Traders familiar with regional prices can soon restore equilibrium by transporting supplies of the scarce commodity. By the same means, farmers aware of prices can save themselves the effort and expense of consigning produce to glutted markets.
An efficient packing house can often provide the focus for effective interdistrict trading because of its ability to grade, pack and arrange transport for produce needed elsewhere.
13.2.3 Seasonal supply. The harvest period of seasonal crops like most fruit and vegetables can be short, with limited quantities of the crop available at the beginning and end of the season and the peak production period coming in between.
The rewards of being able to market a crop outside the normal harvest period are appealing both to farmers and traders because of the higher prices accruing to out-of-season crops. Pre-harvest manipulations can spread out harvesting periods, and post-harvest techniques can extend the marketing period.
13.2.4 Pre-harvest manipulations
Growing locations. Within a given country, a greater range of harvest dates can be established by taking advantage of different climatic conditions. In the extreme, this means that in a large country like Australia freshly harvested potatoes are available year-round because they are grown in areas of a wide range of altitude and latitude. Even in small countries there is some flexibility: Thailand has little variation in latitude, but onions are grown in three areas spanning only an 800 m difference in altitude. The three different harvest periods combined with a simple post-harvest storage programme allow the marketing of onions for nine months of the year.
Farming practices. To profit from high, early-season prices, farmers are tempted to harvest produce earlier than normal. This practice is wrong and should be discouraged as such produce is not fully mature and is therefore of poor eating quality.
Some manipulation of harvesting dates is possible by the judicious use of irrigation late in the growing season. Water applied at the proper time hastens the maturation of many crops and thus they can be harvested earlier but at full maturity. This maturation technique cannot advance harvest dates by more than two weeks, but that can be sufficient to justify early-season prices.
Conversely, the optimum harvest date can be delayed by restricting the use of water. This technique can be useful for a late-maturing district growing a commodity with a very short storage potential where it is profitable to market as long as possible after other districts.
Cultivar selection. The harvesting period can also be adjusted by selecting crop varieties which have different growing periods. Where early harvesting is required, a variety with a short growing period could be selected, and vice versa for late-harvest varieties.
Cultivar selection cannot be done at random. Each variety has unique characteristics and will differ from others in some aspect of appearance or taste. Customers may not like a new variety, and its price may have to be marked down in order to sell.
Post-harvest technique. The ability of a farmer or trader to delay the marketing of produce or to trade on distant markets can be greatly enhanced by the use of post-harvest technology. The wide range of techniques now available to delay ripening, to inhibit ageing and to control pests and diseases is discussed in Chapter 9.
13.3 Market information
The ability of a grower or an organization to plan and act on an efficient marketing strategy for fruit and vegetables will be greatly aided by access to accurate, adequate and timely information on all aspects of the commodities being traded. Although every person in marketing is in the course of his work collecting and analysing information, no individual has the resources to gather information on all markets of current and potential interest. The breadth and diversity of market information can be collected and processed only by some system.
In addition to supplying data to market operators, a market information system performs a valuable public service by making market transactions more transparent. Its best result will be its moderating influence on price fluctuations, as farmers and traders can act more confidently to balance supply and demand and make it more difficult for dishonest or deceptive practices to go unnoticed.
13.3.1 Users of market information. All sections of the fruit and vegetable industry will benefit from a market information system, although each group will use it differently:
* farmers need market information in order to plan production and to time harvest dates and post-harvest operations; it can also give guidance on time, place and price at which to sell produce;
* traders will be helped to find those markets yielding best returns, and retailers will more easily locate sources of supply; since both buyer and seller will be aware of prices being paid by competitors, they will more confidently operate on lower profit margins, with resultant benefits to farmers and consumers;
* transport operators can use market information in order to schedule staff and vehicles more easily;
* storage agencies will be able to use their facilities more efficiently if they are more alert to market trends;
* consumers can benefit by the greater competition a market information system generates among retailers and by a greater awareness of price conditions;
* governments can use market information to develop a sound agricultural policy in regard to food and to monitor national economic development; it can also be used to chart development programmes or export drives and even to establish the need for better roads and additional transport.
13.3.2 Type of market dab required. Information required by persons or organizations will depend on the size and complexity of their operations and on their ability to assimilate and use the information. The type of data gathered by the system therefore needs to be tailored to the needs of the users. A system that is too complex will probably at first be underutilized, thus in effect wasting the time, effort and money spent in gathering the data. On the other hand, a system that is too simple will not do the job of developing efficient marketing. Systems being initiated should thus take into account the increasing capability of its users as they gain experience.
13.3.3 Market price. Market price is the most important information required by market operators. Price data need to be collected from all the major types of trading outlets, and the system should therefore include prices paid at the farm gate, assembly markets, central wholesale markets and retail outlets. If substantial import or export of produce takes place, separate records of those prices should be maintained.
13.3.4 Source of data. Price data must be qualified by the location where obtained. Although some averaging or amalgamation of data is inevitable and it is often desirable to calculate a national average price for commodities, it is essential that districts with distinctive trading patterns retain their identity in the information system. Similarly, for exports and imports, the prices obtained and prices paid for produce at or from different countries should be separately reported.
13.3.5 Trading volume. The volume of produce presented for trading in different markets is of considerable importance since volume is a direct determinant of market price. Data on arrivals in assembly and wholesale markets, outgoing dispatches to other markets and traders, and stock being held in a market should be collected.
13.3.6 Marketing costs. Costs and charges incurred at various stages of the marketing chain could be reported with information on market charges, costs of transport, and stock held.
13.3.7 Coverage of data. Ideally, price and volume information on all produce should be reported daily, but a lower frequency will undoubtedly be more realistic for most countries, owing to the limited resources that can be allocated to information services. If the system is to be of any value to the produce industry, reporting must be done at least once a week.
There will be the need for some sort of codification of markets in the information that is distributed. A central wholesale market has sufficient turnover to be included as an entity, but smaller local markets will need to be grouped into categories based on the kind of market activity. In the same way, there will be some regional grouping of markets into zones, but care must be taken to preserve unique trading features or commodity profiles of different districts.
For commodities which have particular importance to a country but are produced and traded across different market zones, it may be convenient to maintain a separate record of each commodity so that the market price and movement can more easily be followed.
13.3.8 Market reviews. The publication of daily or weekly market information in price and volume of produce traded is useful for a continuing assessment of market strategies, but it can also be adapted for long-term planning by analysing market trends on a quarterly, semiannual or annual basis and for making comparisons with performance in previous years.
13.4 Operating a market information system
If an information service is starting from scratch, it is advisable to limit its scope to a few major commodities and a restricted trading path while aiming to generate daily information to be disseminated the same day or at latest the next day. The goal should be to supply a regular and reliable service that its users see as performing a useful function. Only when the service is operating efficiently should it seek to expand its range of commodities and markets.
Daily reports could be displayed at markets participating in the service, with duplicated sheets distributed to traders and to other interested agencies.
The reports could contain information on:
Price. the highest, the lowest, and the most frequently occurring prices of each unit sold, with reference to the varieties and grades of commodity traded on each market. The most-frequent (or modal) price is important as the barometer of market trends.
Supply. the volume of produce available for trading in the various produce grades; where an accurate measure is not possible, a standardized ranking system could be used, such as a l-to-5 scale, with 3 as the average supply and 5 as great oversupply.
Movements: for larger markets, particularly in cities, arrival and dispatches of loads (including imports) in terms of volume or of number of loads;
Summary. general comments on any significant change in trading pattern or any factors, such as weather or traffic conditions, likely to affect trade soon.
The collection of information should be entrusted to one person well versed in fruit and vegetable trading. It is important that subjective assessments be consistent from day to day, and different observers will naturally show variation in their judgements.
14. Strategies for improvement in marketing
14.1 Development of a plan
The methods available to improve a marketing system are almost infinite. The key to successful marketing improvement is to determine which of these methods are most suitable for a particular marketing situation.
Any marketing improvement programme must be preceded by a study of the existing marketing situation. Then goals for improvement can be established, to be followed by a plan for action. Such a study is best conducted by a government-sponsored group with considerable knowledge of fruit and vegetable marketing, but it should not be directly involved in the ownership or management of existing marketing operations. The active cooperation of fruit and vegetable marketing groups is, however, essential to assist in the study.
The evaluation must identify the size and shape of:
* All inefficiencies in the present marketing operations
* All inadequacies in services
* All weaknesses traceable to poor organization.
The social and economic targets to be achieved need then to be defined, and the deficiencies in the present system ranked in order of importance with respect to these goals. The seriousness of each deficiency in technical terms should also be given with an assessment of possible technical solutions.
The development plan can be short, medium or long term. It may span the total marketing system, but it usually embraces only specific commodities or a subsystem of the marketing chain. It should describe various options to improve marketing in terms of social and economic costs and benefits and their feasibility. The action plan should provide a timetable for the various components:
* Organization and management procedures required
* Targets to be achieved
* Delegation of responsibilities for action to specific people or groups.
Although the government may hold responsibility for coordinating such a plan, the follow-up work should be passed on to industry people such as a market authority or farmers' association, and this could include responsibility for financing parts of the plan. An overdependence on government control and funding can run counter to the efficient management of a commercial enterprise.
14.2 Training of marketing personnel
The lack of qualified personnel is a major constraint to market improvement in developing countries. A prerequisite of any marketing development programme is the presence of people experienced in all aspects of fruit and vegetable marketing. Personnel helping to implement the improvement programme must be qualified in the various supporting technologies and management systems. Experience and knowledge will be required in order to implement:
* an advisory service to assist farmers and post-harvest handling agencies;
* the management of storage facilities and packing houses;
* the organization of market facilities.
Farmers and traders will need training not only in the introduced technologies but also in the need for continuing improvements in marketing.
Training of all personnel associated with marketing operations needs to be a national priority if marketing development is to succeed. Training must, however, be considered a long-term activity: initial training must be followed by work experience and further training at increasingly advanced levels.
Additional training must also be given to officers of extension services, who must themselves acquire enough knowledge of marketing activities to assist farmers.
Traders and post-harvest handling groups will also need to be well informed.
<section>7</section>
14.3 Marketing research services
Marketing research sections are increasingly useful to governments in order to:
* collect information on the level of efficiency and activity of local marketing operations;
* keep abreast of technological developments in other countries and of their potential value to local industry;
* be aware of changing market profiles and the opportunities they present to local traders;
* act as a resource group to issue reports and stimulate discussion on improving marketing.
The section would conduct pre-investment surveys and feasibility studies for government plans but could also provide similar services for private projects of national significance.
Activities of the section would require a specialist in marketing economics, but it should have access also to specialists in all other subjects pertinent to fruit and vegetable marketing, such as agricultural science, post-harvest technology, town planning and construction engineering.
14.4 Assistance to small farmers
Since small farmers produce most of the fruit and vegetables grown in developing countries, any programme to improve marketing must include plans to upgrade their activities. Efforts directed to this end will be consistent with national development policies as most countries give high priority to improving the economic status and quality of life of the small farmer.
14.4.1 Problems to confront. Rapid economic development of small farmers is not easy to achieve. Their status is characterized by:
* small landholdings, usually less than I ha, with occupancy as a tenant or share-cropper with uncertain tenancy rights;
* lack of access to markets because of inadequate roads or transport;
* haphazard choice of crops; careless preparation of produce for market;
* unawareness of post-harvest technologies and facilities;
* forced dependence on a restricted trading environment;
* lack of control over pricing;
* lack of marketing extension services;
* insufficient resources to change marketing practices.
These are some of the obstacles to general development and must be addressed before small farmers can enter the economic mainstream of a developing country.
14.4.2 Improvement programmes. The immediate aim of a marketing improvement programme is generally to generate a higher income for farmers through:
* reduced production and marketing costs;
* reduced post-harvest losses by the introduction of better farming and handling methods;
* achievement of higher market prices because of improved quality of produce;
* training in marketing strategies.
It is not possible to achieve all these goals in a beginning marketing improvement programme. Priority must be given to identifying and attacking the main obstacles to progress, and all farmers will not have identical problems. Thus the programme for each farmer must confront his problems, propose solutions, and balance the costs with the likely benefits.
Problems like bad roads are easy to identify, but to orient the supply of produce to meet market needs is much more difficult to accomplish. The effective programme for small farmers will have to consist of a package of technical and logistical proposals; a few unrelated and superficial changes will not suffice.
Furthermore, the success of an improvement programme will depend on the establishment of a range of marketing services needed to achieve the development objectives. They can be:
* a physical service, such as extension officers to advise farmers;
* an information service, for the provision of data to plan a flexible marketing strategy;
* a resource service, to assist in getting investment credits.
14.5 Role for entrepreneurs
Improvements in food and vegetable marketing can be made possible by the provision of the various technical supports, but the rate of development will depend to a large extent on how quickly these changes can be incorporated in day-to-day operations.
Government activity in promoting marketing improvement is important but its effect in the market place is limited. The most effective bodies to work for change are the private commercial enterprises concerned with trading. Their livelihood depends on conducting an efficient business that meets the needs of the industry. They are therefore most likely to respond to any changes that can work to their benefit.
In the traditional market operation, where produce passes from the farmer to a wholesaler and a consumer through a trader, the trader is seen in a necessary but suspect role: the "exploitive middleman". Various sharp practices have been ascribed to him, with the farmer on the losing end. Regulations to control trading have been adopted; cooperatives have been formed to eliminate private trading. The results are inconclusive, but the economic struggles facing cooperatives show that commercial trading requires considerable managerial skill and that traders' profits are in proportion to their ability to service the market: high turnover in exchange for low profit margin.
To be sure, some small traders are interested only in short-term profits and lack the vision, knowledge and capital to change existing practices. On the other hand, the possibilities for expanding markets and increased profits through widespread improvement of marketing practices would prove irresistible to most experienced and skilled traders.
There is now an increasing realization that profit is not only an acceptable motive for industrial efficiency but also a desirable aspiration. Many government-sponsored and cooperative marketing ventures have failed for lack of a profit motive and a sense of cost-effectiveness.
Private traders are acutely conscious of cost-effectiveness. They should be considered as a resource in any programme to improve marketing.
Appendix I - Crop profiles
Fruits
1. Bananas and plantains (Muse spp.)
Include:
Plantains; traditionally grown for cooking as part of the staple diet, or for processing into more durable products, such as flour, which can be stored for later food use.
Bluggoe; uses are similar to plantains as a locally consumed staple food.
Dessert; includes Gros Michel and Cavendish types, widely grown for export to temperate countries. The ripe fruit is also eaten where it grows, but in some countries it is cooked in the mature green but unripe state as a starchy staple.
Maturity for harvest
Published recommendations of maturity standards for export dessert bananas do not apply to bananas grown for local consumption. Many types of bananas are grown for local use in different countries, and these are cooked or processed in a variety of ways. When bananas are to be sent to distant urban markets they are best harvested in hard mature but unripe green state, which reduces the risk of deterioration during transport.
Harvesting
The method of harvesting will depend on the height of the plant. Low-growing varieties can be harvested by cutting through the bunch stalk about 30 to 35 cm above the top hand. With taller varieties, the stem of the plant will be partly cut through to bring the bunch down within the harvester's reach, and then the bunch stalk can be cut through. Harvested bunches are best carried on a foam-padded tray to reduce damage during carrying.
Field handling
It is customary in most banana-growing countries to transport the fruit to market on the bunch. This practice injures the fruit during handling and transport, and it is not recommended. Bananas for urban markets will suffer less damage and look better if they are dehanded and packed in suitable boxes.
Selection and grading
Bananas which are very immature and small, badly damaged or decaying should be discarded. Size and quality grading will depend on the demands of the market. In the more sophisticated urban markets (e.g supermarkets), sizegraded and good-looking fruit may command a higher price.
Packing
All harvested bananas should be kept dry and in the shade before and after packing. Packing is best done in or as near to the field as possible. There must be facilities for keeping the fruit and packaging dry.
As soon as the hands of bananas are cut from the stem, they should be laid, curved side uppermost, across the midribs of fresh banana leaves (Figure CP I .1). This will prevent latex from the cut crown contaminating the fruit. Latex flow should stop in 12-15 minutes, after which the banana may be packed into wooden or, preferably, cardboard boxes, which can be of the slotted or telescopic type. Whole hands of bananas can be divided into clusters of four or more fruit which can be packed more compactly to give a greater weight of fruit per box.
The hands or clusters should be packed in the boxes with the curved side uppermost in the manner shown in Figure CP 1.2, making sure that the crowns of the upper hands do not damage the bananas underneath. Boxes should be full but not overpacked, otherwise the bananas will be damaged because the fruit itself and not the walls of the boxes will be supporting the upper boxes of the stack.
Post-harvest treatments
No special post-harvest treatments should be necessary for bananas sold locally or for those which will be sold to consumers in urban markets within four or five days.
If sales are to be delayed for a greater time and the fruit sold in a ripening condition, it may be necessary to wash and then dip or spray them with a fungicide before packing.
Figure CP 1.1 Hands of harvested bananas, once cut from the stalk, should be placed like this on a leaf midrib to let latex drain away from fruit
Storage
Bananas have a very short post-harvest life at ambient conditions. This is four to ten days when mature green and two to four days when ripe. Both green and ripe bananas are sensitive to cold and are damaged by temperatures less than 13 degrees Celsius.
Ripening
Bananas harvested in the mature green stage will normally ripen under the local ambient conditions in which they are grown, but some types will not develop their full ripe skin colour. Where urban high-value markets demand fully coloured fruit, ripening under controlled conditions is best carried out on a large scale at the urban distribution point. The operation requires special equipment, good management and technical skills.
Where the ripening operation is to be undertaken locally, advice should be sought from specialists.
Figure CP 1.2 This is a typical sequence for the effective packing of banana hands in cardboard boxes
2. Citrus (Citrus spp.)
Includes:
Oranges, grapefruit, mandarins; used ripe as fresh fruit and for juice.
Lemons and limes; used mature green or ripe for culinary purposes and for drinks.
Maturity for harvest
The assessment of the readiness of citrus fruit for harvest presents some problems for small-scale producers because:
* citrus fruits do not ripen further after harvest. To reach their full flavour and sweetness they must be left on the tree to ripen;
* in the tropics citrus often remain green when they are fully ripe internally and do not develop an orange-yellow colour on the tree. The development of the orange-yellow skin colour can be artificially induced after harvest (degreening).
These facts make it very difficult to assess harvest maturity just from the appearance of the fruit on the tree. Small-scale producers marketing their own fruit will be able to assess the readiness of their fruit on several counts, which will vary in different situations, for example:
* Skin colour: where it develops normally, this will be a good guide to ripeness; if normal skin colour does not develop, maturity may be indicated by a change in the shade of green shown by the skin; lemons change from dark green to a silvery-green appearance at maturity.
* Size: experienced growers may evaluate maturity by considering size as well as with other characteristics, such as slight changes in skin colour.
* Internal condition of fruit: if a few typical fruit thought to be mature are cut in two, they can be considered ripe if:
1. the juice has developed full flavour and is sweet;
2. the fruit pulp has developed to the normal colour;
3. juice drips from the half-fruit when the cut surface is held vertically.
Harvesting
Although the skin of citrus fruit is relatively tough and can tolerate some degree of pressure, it is easily cut or punctured, providing access to the serious post-harvest decay diseases: blue and green mould. Every care must be taken to avoid cutting or puncturing the skin of citrus fruits at all times. Clippers or secateurs should be used to remove the fruit from the tree. Fruit may be pulled by hand, but there is danger that the stem may be pulled out of the fruit, damaging the skin, or of damage to the tree providing an entry point for field diseases. Not more than 0.5 cm of stem should be left attached to the fruit. If the fruit is mature or ripe this piece of stem will dry up and fall off, leaving only the flower calyx (button) attached to the fruit. As it is harvested, citrus fruit should be placed in picking bags worn by the harvester or in plastic buckets.
Field handling
Harvested fruit is taken in the harvesting container either directly to the packing facility or to the field assembly point, where it is emptied into field containers. At either point the fruit should be protected from exposure to sunlight and rain while awaiting packing or movement to the packing house.
Selection
Before it is packed the fruit should be sorted to eliminate all foreign material, such as leaves and twigs. The fruit is then inspected and pieces which are unripe, immature, undersized, damaged or decaying should be discarded. The extent to which superficial skin damage can be tolerated will depend upon the market. Local consumers may be more concerned about the eating quality of produce than its external appearance.
Size grading
Where citrus is to be pattern-packed in custom-made cardboard boxes, it is usually an advantage to grade it into size categories. The differences between categories will depend on the type of fruit. Suggested minimum sizes and grade category differences for different commodities are:
Commodity Minimum (mm) Grade difference (mm)
Oranges, lemons, mandarins 50 5-10
Grapefruit 70 15-20
Limes are not normally size-graded. Citrus sent to local markets in wooden crates will usually be size-graded by the retailer at the point of sale.
Packing
Citrus for sale in local and internal urban markets is packed in a variety of containers. Baskets, wooden boxes, sacks, bags, factory-made wooden crates and cardboard boxes are all used. Most citrus from large scale commercial production are now packed in telescopic cardboard boxes. Recommended outside dimensions for the box are 50x 30x 30 cm. These can be stacked eight boxes per layer on standard 1 x 1.2 m pallets. The capacity of these boxes is about 18-20 kg. Wooden crates can also be used for citrus provided they do not have sharp edges or splinters which will damage the skin of the fruit. Wooden crates should not exceed 25 kg capacity. Larger crates are difficult to handle and if dropped can severely damage the contents. Citrus fruits can be packed a little above the top of the box so that they are under slight pressure when the box is closed. This prevents movement of fruit within the box during transport and handling and allows for natural shrinkage.
Post-harvest treatments
Citrus produced for local and other internal markets should not require specific post-harvest treatments provided it is handled carefully and packed properly. Commercially grown citrus for export is normally washed, treated with fungicide and wax-coated on highly automated packing lines. There may be occasions where citrus for internal urban markets requires fungicide treatment. Where this is necessary, the fruit should be washed and dried after sorting, then treated with fungicide and dried before packing. In those countries where some types of citrus remain green when ripe it is not usually necessary to degreen them for market. Degreening will only change the colour of the skin of citrus fruits. It will not ripen them internally. Degreening is carried out by exposing the fruit to ethylene gas under controlled environmental conditions. It can only add to the cost of the fruit to the consumer, without any compensation in eating quality.
Storage
Citrus fruits can be held up to three weeks under ambient conditions, depending upon the temperature and moisture content of the air. In dry air they may lose moisture and shrink after a few days. Damaged fruit may become infected and decay quickly after harvest.
3. Mangoes (Mangifera indica cvs.)
The following information refers to mangoes produced for consumption in the ripe state. In some countries they are eaten in the unripe green state, or processed in this condition into pickles and other preserves.
Maturity for harvest
Mangoes will not ripen normally if they are harvested before reaching the fully mature-green stage on the tree: they will lack sweetness and be poor in flavour. Mature-green fruit left on the tree will ripen and eventually fall.
There are no simple reliable tests to indicate when mangoes are ready for harvest. A number of characteristics have been suggested for evaluating maturity, but they are not reliable for all cultivars or for all growing conditions. They must be interpreted in the light of local experience. They include:
* the height of the "shoulders" of the fruit with respect to the point of the stem attachment; when shoulders are above the stem attachment, the fruit is mature (Figure CP3.1);
* the fruit colour changes from dark green to light green as the fruit matures; yellowing of the green fruit occurs as ripening begins;
* when the "cheeks" of the fruit are full, it is mature;
* in mature fruit the sap flowing from the cut stem at harvest is thick and does not flow freely.
No single one of these clues can be regarded as a reliable test of maturity for all cultivars. Observation and experience are the best guides for the small-scale producer.
Harvesting
Mangoes are best harvested with clippers or secateurs leaving not more than 5 mm of fruit stalk attached to the fruit. Mangoes can be pulled from the tree by hand leaving a longer amount of fruit stalk, but this then must subsequently be cut back to less than 5 mm. This method is not recommended since pulling the fruit often results in damage and subsequent decay at the stem end.
Figure CP3.1 There is no sure way to know when mangoes are ready for harvest. One of many methods is this: in immature fruit, the shoulders are below the level of attachment of the stem (a); in mature fruit, the shoulders have risen above the stem-attachment level (b). This method does not apply to all cultivars and must be considered with other factors
Small trees can be harvested by hand from the ground or from ladders. A high proportion of small-scale production of mangoes is, however, from old and large trees whose fruit is inaccessible to pickers on the ground. These fruits can be harvested by the use of picking poles with a net bag suspended by a metal ring of 25-30 cm diameter attached to the top of the pole. The ring of the picking pole usually has a device for cutting or pulling the fruit from the tree (Figure CP3.2). Some commercial picking poles are available but growers commonly make their own.
Mangoes are often harvested either by a picker on a ladder or by one who climbs the tree and throws the fruit to a catcher on the ground (Figure CP3.3).
Figure CP3.2 Picking poles are used to harvest tree fruit which cannot be reached from the ground or a ladder. Both the factory-made (a) and the home-made (b) types have a culling device and a catching bag
(Figure CP3. 2a is reproduced from A manual of post-harvest handling systems for perishable food crops, No 001 Mango, Ministry of Agriculture. Lands and Food Production, and UCA, Trinidad and Tobago, 1986.)
Field handling
Harvested mangoes should be placed in field containers of not more than 25 kg capacity for movement to the packing shed. The fruit should be kept in the shade and handled carefully at all times after harvest.
Selection and grading
Before packing, all damaged, decaying, immature and ripe fruit should be removed. For local markets grading may not be necessary.
Fruit which is to be packed in cardboard boxes needs to be graded if it is to be pattern-packed in layers or to be packed in single layers in boxes with dividers.
Figure CP3.3 Mango-picker in the tree drops the fruit, and catcher breaks its fall using a jute sack supported by his hands and one foot. He then lowers the bag to ground level and the mango rolls out without damage
Post-harvest treatments
Mangoes do not normally need any post-harvest treatment for local marketing.
Fruits for urban supermarkets may need to be washed if they are heavily contaminated with latex or dust. If they are washed, they should be dried at once by spreading them in a single layer on a raised mesh or slatted rack, in the shade but with good air circulation. In no circumstances should the wet mangoes be piled up on the ground or left exposed to the sun to dry.
Anthracnose is the principal cause of post-harvest decay in mangoes. It is a latent infection, spread by raindrops which collect spores from the plant branches and spread them on to the fruit, where they germinate only after harvest as the fruit ripens. The disease does not respond to a post-harvest fungicide dip alone. On a commercial scale, mangoes for export are sometimes dipped in hot water containing fungicide for the control of this disease. The treatment is not appropriate for small-scale operations.
Packing
Various types of package are used for mangoes, depending on market requirements. Fruit for local markets is often packed in baskets or wooden crates, which may be lined with straw or leaves. Packs weighing more than 25 kg are difficult to handle carefully and can cause damage to the fruit.
For urban retailers and supermarkets it is now customary to pack mangoes in cardboard boxes holding 10 to 15 kg. Fruit can be loose packed (Figure 7.7) or in a single layer with dividers (Figure 7.9).
Boxes should not be overpacked or the fruit in lower boxes may suffer damage from the weight of boxes above. Underpacking results in excessive movement of the fruit within the box, and consequent bruising or abrasion damage. Mangoes packed in cardboard boxes can be displayed for retail sale in the box.
Storage
Mature-green mangoes have only a short life at ambient temperatures. Green matured mangoes can be stored for only about two weeks at 13 degrees Celsius. At temperatures below this, they suffer chill damage and fail to ripen afterwards. At ambient tropical temperatures they ripen in four to seven days. At such temperatures they can be held for only two to four days when ripe.

Vegetables
4. Bulb onions and garlic (Allium cepa, A. sativum and other species)
Onions and garlic of different types are grown worldwide for the flavour they contribute to food. They are also commonly regarded as having medicinal properties. In many countries onions are used in the immature green state. In others, where the crop is seasonal, cultivars which produce bulbs that can be stored in a dry state are grown.
Maturity for harvesting
When the bulbs developing from the leaf bases of both garlic and onions are fully formed, the leafy green tops begin to yellow and eventually collapse at a point a little above the top of the bulb, leaving an upright short neck. When the tops "go down" in this way, the bulbs are ready for harvesting. Because all the onions or garlic in a crop do not mature at the same time, large-scale commercial growers harvest them when about half the tops have gone down.
Small-scale growers can, if they wish, harvest their crops progressively as the tops go down, especially so if they intend to store the dry onions for sale or use at a later date.
Harvesting
Since onion bulbs are normally formed at the soil surface, it is sometimes possible in sandy soils to pull the mature bulbs by hand. Where conditions make hand-pulling impossible, and with garlic where the bulbs develop below ground, harvesting is done by loosening the bulbs with a fork or hoe before lifting them, in a manner similar to that described for root crops in Figure CP4.1.
In dry, sunny weather the harvested crop is left in windrows in the field for a few days until the tops are dry. Where the harvested bulbs are exposed to high-intensity sunlight (e.g. at high altitudes in the tropics), the windrows should be made so that the green tops cover the bulbs to protect them from sunburn.
Selection and grading
All damaged or decaying onion and garlic bulbs should be discarded. Onions with thick necks should be put aside for immediate use because they will not store well.
Market requirements will determine whether onions need to be size graded or not. Retailers in local markets will normally do their own grading when making up lots for sale.
Figure CP4.1 Damage in harvesting roots, tubers and other underground crops is more easily avoided if crops are grown in mounds or raised beds
If the onions or garlic are to be made up into strings for storage or sale, as described below, it is an advantage to separate them into sizes so that the bulbs will be more or less uniform in size in any string. This makes the stringing operation easier and gives a better appearance to the finished product.
Post-harvest treatment
The only post-harvest treatment required for the long storage of bulb onions is a thorough curing of the bulbs. Curing is a drying process intended to dry off the necks and outer scale leaves of the bulbs to prevent the loss of moisture and the attack by decay during storage. It can be carried out in the field under dry conditions by windrowing the bulbs as described above under Harvesting.
The essentials for curing are heat and good ventilation, preferably with low humidity. This dries out the neck and the two or three outer layers of the bulb. The outermost layer, which may be contaminated with soil, usually falls away easily when the bulbs are cured, exposing the dry under-layer, which should have an attractive appearance.
If onions cannot be dried in the field, they can be collected in trays, which are then stacked in a warm, covered area with good ventilation.
In cool, damp climates, onions in bulk ventilated stores are dried with artificial heat blown through the bulk at a duct temperature of 30 degrees Celsius.
Garlic and onions can also be cured by tying the tops of the bulbs in bunches and hanging them on a horizontal pole in a well-ventilated situation.
Packaging
For bulk marketing, the tops of onions are removed when they are thoroughly cured and the necks are quite dry. The tops of garlic are cut off I cm above the bulb and only the loose outer skin rubbed off.
Both onions and garlic may be made up into strings. These are of 2 kg for garlic or 5 kg to 10 kg for onions. This is, however, a labour-intensive operation suited to small-scale production using family labour. It is not cost-effective on a commercial scale.
Storage
The first requirement for successful storage of dry bulb onions is that the cultivar chosen should have the right characteristics for long-term storage. The principal needs are:
* the cultivar should have a long dormant period;
* it should be a cultivar which forms a strong outer skin when fully cured; brown- and red-skinned cultivars tend to be better in this respect;
* the bulbs put into storage should be disease-free; the most important storage disease is neck rot, which is controlled by dusting the onion seed before planting with benomyl fungicide at the rate of 1 g active material per kilogram of seed.
The storage environment must be dry and well-ventilated. Optimum storage temperatures are 0 or 24-30 degrees Celsius under ambient tropical conditions. At temperatures between these, onions will sprout in storage (Figure CP4.2).
Onions stored in a damp atmosphere will develop roots (Figure CP4.3). Onions can be stored in bulk in insulated stores, with fans for cooling the onions using cold night air. This method is used where large tonnages are to be stored. Small-scale growers can use naturally ventilated stores made from local materials. The onions can be stacked in trays or in layers on slatted shelves.
Figure CP4.4 Onions can be strung for storage as shown above. They then can be hung as shown right, in a cool, shady place
Where small amounts are to be stored, the stringing of onions in 5 kg or 10 kg lots and the hanging of the strings in a well-ventilated dry location is a very effective storage method. The tops of the onions should not be cut off but left so that they can be fixed to a double string (Figure CP4.4) by weaving the dried top of each onion through the strings in a figure-8 fashion. Alternatively onions can be tied by their dried tops in bunches, and the bunches can hang on a horizontal line or pole in the shade.
Garlic may be stored in trays, strings or bunches in the same manner as onions, except that with garlic strings are made by plaiting the dry top leaves of the garlic.
5. Leafy vegetables and Immature flower heads (Brassica spp, Beta sp., Spinacea sp., Aplum sp., Lactuca sp., Alllium)
Include cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, rape, mustard, broccoli, chard, spinach beet, spinach, lettuce, celery, green onions.
Maturity for harvesting
All are harvested in the immature state before the plant has developed to the point of seed production. The older parts of these commodities become fibrous or woody.
Harvesting
The parts of the plant harvested vary with the crop:
* Cabbage, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, celery and green onions form more or less compact heads; the entire head is harvested at one time.
* Kale, rape, mustard and broccoli. Young shoots, with or without immature flower heads, are picked by hand-breaking; can usually be harvested over a period of time as long as new shoots continue to develop.
* Chard, spinach beet, and spinach are harvested as individual young leaves; sometimes young shoots of spinach are harvested; harvesting is repeated as new leaves continue to develop.
Those crops forming a head, such as cabbage, are cut with a sharp knife. Young shoots and leaves are broken off by hand.
Celery and green onions are either pulled by hand or dug from the soil. They should be harvested under dry conditions when soil can be readily shaken from the roots. The roots are then trimmed with a sharp knife.
All these commodities are damaged easily if subjected to pressure. They should be packed loosely in field containers, which must not be overfilled or the produce will be damaged when the containers are stacked.
The harvested produce must be kept free from contamination by soil. Leafy vegetables and immature flower heads deteriorate very quickly after harvest because they lose water fast and produce a great deal of heat. The following care is necessary to keep losses to a minimum:
* They must be packed loosely in well-ventilated field containers; if they are piled in a tight mass, the heat they generate cannot escape.
* They must be kept in the shade and not exposed to direct sunlight.
* They must not be exposed to drying winds or they will lose water quickly and become wilted and soft; at the same time there must be enough ventilation to disperse the natural buildup of heat.
* There must be the shortest possible delay between harvest and sale or consumption because leafy commodities have a very short post-harvest life under ambient conditions.
Selection and grading
All produce which is damaged, decaying, wilted or infested by insects or other pests must be discarded. Size-grading is not normally necessary for local and internal marketing.
Post-harvest treatment
It is essential to keep these commodities free from contamination by soil or decaying plant material. Do not wash them. Washing them may remove gross soil contamination, but it will also spread any decay through the whole bulk and result in heavy losses. Shading the produce and keeping it in a moist atmosphere helps to keep it cool, reduces water loss, and delays wilting and yellowing of leaves.
Chemical treatments to control decay are not acceptable because they are not very effective and they leave high residue levels because of the characteristic high surface area of these products in relation to their volume.
Packaging
For local rural markets traditional containers are likely to remain in use. It is important, however, that containers should not be too large to be carried by one person. Rough handling of heavy packages results in damage to produce.
* Packaging of leafy vegetables and immature flower heads for urban markets will vary with the type of commodity:
* Cabbages: woven sacks or net bags of 20-25 kg capacity are suitable.
* Lettuce: wooden crates or ventilated cardboard boxes each containing 24 heads of lettuce.
* Celery: wooden crates holding 20-30 heads of celery.
* Broccoli: well-ventilated cardboard boxes holding 5 kg.
* Green onions: normally tied in bunches by the grower; they are best transported in small wooden crates holding 10-15 kg.
* Chard and spinach: crisp, brittle and easily broken by rough handling; they are best packed loosely in cardboard boxes of 5-10 kg capacity; overpacking will cause crushing of leaves and bruising and rapid discoloration of stems.
* Kale, rape and leafy brassicas: may be tied in bunches or packed loose; they can be marketed in nets or cardboard boxes of 5-10 kg capacity.
Storage
Leafy vegetables and immature flower heads have a very short post-harvest life, especially under ambient conditions. Even under refrigeration most remain in good condition only up to two weeks. Ideally, they should reach the consumer within two days of harvest.
6. Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum)
Maturity for harvest
If they are to be used in the ripe condition, tomatoes should be picked at the earliest when they are at least mature green. Immature tomatoes do not ripen after harvest. The actual stage at which they should be picked depends upon local preference and custom in each country.
Tomatoes have reached the mature-green condition when they are fully rounded and have changed from dark to medium or light green, and the skin develops a waxy gloss. As ripening is initiated, the fruit shows a pale pink or yellow tinge, which develops through a definite pink to full red.
Most tomatoes are harvested at the early ripening or pink stage, depending on market preference and the time they take to reach the retailer. Tomatoes to be consumed immediately can be harvested when fully ripe.
Harvesting
Tomato fruit stalks have a natural break-point. Mature fruit readily breaks away from the cluster when pressure is placed on this point while lifting the fruit upwards (Figure CP6.1). Tomatoes are best harvested into plastic buckets (pails) and transferred if necessary to plastic field crates holding not more than 25 kg weight.
Selection and grading
Figure CP6.1 A natural break-point occurs on many mature fruits at the junction of stem and stalk. At harvest time, thumb pressure applied there should be accompanied by lifting, pulling and turning the fruit
All decaying, damaged, undersized and sunburned tomatoes should be discarded. Size-grading for the local market is normally done by retailers. Internal urban markets, including supermarkets, may have differential prices for size grades as against ungraded fruit. Catering and institutional buyers do not normally demand size-graded fruit.
Post-harvest treatments
If only those tomatoes which are in good condition are marketed, there should be no need for any post-harvest treatments. Tomatoes produced on a large commercial scale may be subjected to artificial ripening; but in countries where production is mostly on a small scale, this is not necessary since tomatoes are normally harvested at maturity and ripen naturally.
Packaging
For local markets tomatoes can be packed in baskets or other traditional containers assuring careful handling, i.e. rigid enough to protect the contents from being crushed.
For urban markets cardboard telescopic boxes or trays, or wooden trays with capacities of not more than 15 kg, should be used. Size-graded tomatoes can be pattern-packed in layers to make best use of the box.
Ungraded tomatoes are jumble-packed to a given weight.
Storage
Tomatoes have relatively poor storage capability. Green mature fruit can be held for up to two weeks at 13-18 degrees Celsius, but for less time under ambient tropical temperatures.
Fully ripe tomatoes have only two to six days' storage life, depending on ambient temperatures.
Root crops
7. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum)
These are also called Irish or white potatoes. Although most of the world potato production is in temperate regions, the crop is becoming more important as a food source in the tropics and subtropics.
Maturity for harvest
Potatoes can be harvested for immediate consumption in an immature state, usually from the time they reach full flowering. At this time the skin is thin and soft, and the potatoes cannot be stored. Main-crop potatoes which may need to be stored should not be harvested until at least two weeks after the plant tops have died off, by which time the skin of the tubers is fully developed and they are mature. They are then less susceptible to damage than immature potatoes.
Harvesting
Potato harvesting is best done when the soil is slightly moist. Where they are produced on a small scale, harvesting is carried out with hand-tools (Figure CP4.1). The tubers must be lifted carefully to avoid damage, and shaken free of soil. They are left to dry in the field, after which they are collected in field containers and placed in a cool, shady place. Potatoes for food must not be exposed to the light for more than a few hours after harvest or they will turn green, develop an unpleasant taste, and may become toxic.
Selection and grading
All potatoes showing greening, decay or severe damage owing to harvesting or pest attack should be discarded at harvest. Immature tubers and those showing minor damage or wetted by rain should be put aside for immediate consumption. Potatoes to be stored for food or seed should be fully mature and free from any visible damage or decay. Size-grading requirements will depend on market demand. In most cases there will be only minimum-size standards, sometimes maximum-size also. Local specialists should be consulted on the subject.
Post-harvest treatments
Potatoes which are to be stored need to be cured to repair any skin damage which may be present. The principles of curing root and tuber crops are discussed in Chapter 9 of this manual. Curing is best carried out after the potatoes have been placed in store. It involves reducing ventilation to allow a buildup of the temperature and humidity needed to promote curing. The potatoes in store should be covered with straw, and the store should be well insulated in order to prevent the condensation of free water on the potatoes.
The storage conditions suitable for curing potatoes are:
Temperature 13 to 20 degrees Celsius
Relative humidity 85% or more
Curing time 7 to 15 days
The highest temperature requires the shortest time. At the end of the curing time, full ventilation should be restored to the store.
Storage
Only sound potatoes with no apparent damage or decay should be stored. Potatoes to be used for food or for processing must be kept in the dark to prevent greening. Seed potatoes are stored in diffuse light to promote the development of several strong shoots on each tuber.
Storage structures
On-the-farm storage can be carried out using low-cost structures employing local skills and materials. Where climatic conditions are suitable, potatoes can be left in the field some weeks after maturity but in general it is preferable to collect them in a structure where some measure of control over storage conditions can be achieved.
Clamps constructed as shown in Figure 10.2 are used in cool climates for storage of six months or more. They can be effective under warmer conditions provided they have adequate ventilation and are in a well-drained situation.
Low-cost, small-scale pole and thatch stores holding up to two tonnes of potatoes can be constructed in the field; they are particularly suitable for seed potatoes held in diffuse light conditions (Figure 10.1). Potatoes are held in these stores in open trays or on well-ventilated shelves.
Existing buildings may sometimes be modified for storing up to 20 tonnes of potatoes under natural or assisted ventilation. Whatever the type of store, it is necessary to keep the potatoes dry and as cool as possible by having an insulated structure with good ventilation.
Packing
Although baskets or wooden boxes may be used to market potatoes, sacks are cheaper and more commonly used. In temperate climates potatoes are commonly packed for distribution in 25 kg multiwall paper sacks or woven synthetic fibre (polythene or polypropylene) sacks. The use of paper sacks is not recommended under warmer conditions because they lack adequate ventilation. Woven jute sacks are preferred for potatoes in the tropics. They are usually of 50 kg capacity and provide good ventilation. Woven synthetic fibre (polythene or polypropylene) sacks are also used, but they are so smooth that they slide easily against each other and make stacking them very difficult.
8. Sweet potato (lpomoea batatas)
Sweet potatoes are grown widely throughout the tropics as a basic or subsidiary staple food crop in subsistence economies. They are also widely used as an animal feed and in some countries as an industrial raw material.
Maturity for harvest
Sweet potatoes are considered ready for harvest when the leaves begin to yellow. A further test of readiness to harvest is said to be that when mature tubers are cut, the cut surface does not discolour. In some countries experienced growers harvest at a specified time after planting. This has to be based on careful observation and long experience since there is a difference in the maturity period of the various cultivars.
Harvesting
Harvesting is carried out either progressively or all at one time. Subsistence growers tend to harvest progressively, often from the same plants over a long period. Sweet potato crops grown for sale are usually harvested all at one time.
The preferred harvesting tools for most small-scale producers are pointed wooden sticks or metal bars, or machetes (cutlasses, bolos, pangas), especially where progressive harvesting is practiced. These tools are said to cause less damage to the roots (Figure CP4.1) and enable a few roots to be harvested from a plant on each occasion. When the whole crop is harvested at one time, growers tend to use pronged rakes, hoes or digging forks.
On no account should the roots be thrown, whether into field and storage containers or at any other time during their handling. Great care must be taken to avoid damage to the skin of sweet potato roots since they are very subject to post-harvest decay under tropical conditions. For this reason it is recommended that the harvested roots be gathered into baskets, boxes or crates in which they can remain throughout their post-harvest life without disturbance, through curing and storage if necessary.
Harvested tubers which have damp soil adhering to them at harvest may be left in the field for an hour or so to dry, but not long enough to suffer sun scorch. The soil can then be carefully removed.
Selection and grading
All decaying roots should be discarded. Slightly damaged roots can be used for immediate consumption, and those which are undersize or badly damaged may be fed to animals. Tubers which are to be stored should be fully mature and free from visible injury. Most sweet potatoes are sizegraded by the retailer if necessary.
Post-harvest treatments
Curing of those roots which are to be stored after harvest is the only treatment necessary for sweet potatoes. This curing has to be carried out according to the principles laid down in Chapter 9.
The roots should remain in the containers into which they were harvested and in which they will be stored. The containers can be placed in the storage structure and covered with straw. Ventilation should be restricted to allow a buildup of heat and moisture in the store, to give the correct conditions for storage, which are:
Temperature 27-34 degrees Celsius
Relative humidity 85-95%
Curing time 5-20 days
Curing is a process of healing by the formation of new skin on damaged areas of sweet potatoes, and also of the maturing and hardening of the whole skin of the roots. The length of time required for curing cannot be forecast since it has been shown to vary even under identical environmental conditions. Indications of maturity are said to be thus: when the skin can no longer be rubbed off easily from a sample root and when small buds appear on the roots.
Storage
Sweet potatoes are subject to very rapid deterioration after harvest at ambient tropical temperatures. There are reports in the literature of storage of sweet potatoes for four months or more. In most reported instances of successful storage for such a time the storage temperature has been in the low range of 10-18 degrees Celsius. Even at the higher end of this range sprouting of the roots has been a problem. At temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius sweet potatoes suffer chill damage.
The storage structures used have been either custom-built ventilated stores, with or without refrigeration, or sunken or underground chambers, protected by a building above. Conditions required for successful storage are as follows:
* The roots must be fully mature and well cured before storage.
* They must be handled carefully at all times and only sound roots should be stored.
* The best temperature range for storage is 10-15 degrees Celsius.
* The relative humidity should be 85 to 90 percent.
If there is any indication of free water on the roots or in the store, more ventilation should be provided to remove the excess moisture. If the air gets too dry the floor of the store can be lightly sprinkled with water.
These conditions can be achieved at higher altitudes in the tropics at those times when night temperatures fall to within the required range. In a well-insulated ventilated store, the tubers can be cooled at night by full ventilation and heat rise can be slowed during the day by closing the store. It is unlikely that sweet potatoes can be stored at ambient tropical temperatures for more than three weeks without heavy losses from decay and sprouting.
Packaging
The best form of packaging for long transport is either wooden crates or cardboard boxes holding not more than 25 kg. The roots should be packed firmly to prevent movement within the boxes or crates during handling and transport. Sweet potatoes should not be packed in 50 kg sacks, which are difficult to handle and, when dropped, cause heavy damage to the roots.
9. Yams (Dioscorea spp.)
Yams are grown principally as a subsistence crop and for internal marketing. The main types are:
* Greater yam (D. alata)
* White yam (D. rotundata)
* Yellow yam (D. cayenensis)
Maturity for harvest
Yams are ready for harvest when the above-ground parts of the plants have died off. The greater and white yams can be left in the ground for a time after maturity. Yellow yams, which have a very short dormant period, should be lifted as soon as mature.
Harvesting
Yams are normally harvested by carefully scraping the soil away from the tubers in order to avoid damaging them. Wooden digging sticks or spades are less likely to cause damage to the tubers than are metal forks or hoes.
Selection and grading
Heavily damaged or decaying yams should be discarded. Those which are slightly damaged may be consumed immediately or subjected to a curing process before storage. Size-grading is not always practiced. It is mainly done when there is an advantage to be gained in the packaging for marketing.
Post-harvest treatments
Where yams are cut or deeply injured, a new skin can be formed on the damaged surfaces by curing the tubers at high temperature and humidity. Curing has been shown to be effective in yellow and white yams, but its effectiveness in other types is not known. Injuries caused by skin abrasion or bruising tend to dry out rather than form replacement skin. Curing is carried out in accordance with the method referred to in Chapter 9 of this manual.
A method recommended in West Africa for curing yams which are to be stored is illustrated in Figure CP9.1. This provides the necessary conditions for raising the temperature and moisture content of the air to suitable levels by restricting ventilation.
The conditions found to be effective in promoting the curing of greater and white yams are:
Temperature 32-40 degrees Celsius
Relative humidity 90% or above
Curing time 1-7 days
Curing should be carried out immediately after harvest at the location where the yams are to be stored.
Figure CP9.1 Yams stacked in this method to cure skin damage should be covered with grass to keep the canvas or jute cover from touching the yams. The curing pile should not be exposed to direct sunlight and the cover should be removed after four days
Figure CP9.2 In humid areas of West Africa yams may be stored in 'barns" like this whose side poles have taken root and are growing leaves to provide shade (right). Inside walls of yam barn are vertical frames to which yams are tied (above). (Figures are reproduced from Careful storage of yams: some basic principles to reduce losses, Commonwealth Secretariat. London.)
Packaging
Yams being sent to local markets may be carried in bulk by vehicle or in ordinary baskets. When they are carried in bulk, the floor and sides of the vehicle should be padded with sacks loosely packed with straw, or with grass mats or plastic foam covered with polythene sheet. Whether the yams are carried in bulk or in baskets, the vehicle must not be overloaded and should be driven with care. For internal urban markets the tubers are best packed in wooden crates or ventilated cardboard boxes. These containers should not be overpacked and must be handled and transported carefully.
Storage
Greater and white yams in good condition can be stored for several months under appropriate conditions. Yellow yams have poor storage potential due to their very short dormancy period. Although yams may keep in storage for several months, they shrink over such a period owing to water loss and to natural living processes which use up stored dry matter (starch). There may also be additional losses because of decay caused by moulds.
There are many different storage practices in various countries. Owing to the generally non-commercial nature of yam production and limited resources of growers, most storage uses low-cost methods. Yams are generally stored during the hot dry part of the year when the provision of ventilation and other conditions which help to reduce their temperature are key factors.
Yams kept in the ground and harvested progressively when needed are subject to attack by insects and other pests. They are also exposed to attack by moulds. Yams kept undug may also tie up limited land resources.
The tubers can be piled in small numbers in shaded situations or in well ventilated huts built of local materials, in which case they are best stored on racks or shelves.
In West Africa, yam "barns" are a common method of storage. They are vertical frames to which individual yams are tied (Figure CP9.2). The uprights supporting the frames are bush poles up to two or more metres in height. The use of poles which will take root and provide a protective canopy of leaves to shade the yams is of benefit. Such growing poles are also less likely to decay or be attacked by termites. The stored frames of yams may be protected by a fence to keep out rats.

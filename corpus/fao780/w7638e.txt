PREFACE
The Uruguay Round Agreements represent a milestone in the multilateral trading system: for the first time, agriculture has been incorporated under operationally effective rules and disciplines. The Uruguay Round commitments in agriculture, forestry and fisheries cover improved market access and disciplines on domestic support and export subsidies. The commitments regarding market access are central to the broader package of interrelated liberalizing commitments aimed at significantly improving conditions of competition and opportunities for trade in agricultural products. The Uruguay Round Agreements also provide for limiting the scope for circumvention of the new commitments.
The Uruguay Round Agreements present opportunities for all countries to benefit from greater access to world markets by curbing past production- and trade-distorting practices and by facilitating more competitive and fairer trade. Signatories to the Agreements also assume the obligation of complying with their provisions. In order to fulfil this obligation and take advantage of the new opportunities, it is essential that countries develop their own capacity to examine, assess and evaluate their national circumstances in the context of the Agreements.
There are considerable differences in countries' ability to assess their specific circumstances, meet their Uruguay Round commitments in agriculture, forestry and fisheries and subsequently benefit from the results, and many will require technical assistance before they can do so. Because of its specialist expertise and unique position in international agricultural, forestry and fisheries affairs, FAO is well placed to provide that assistance.
The principal purpose of this booklet is to provide information on the technical assistance that FAO is able to provide member countries in building their capacity to deal with trade-related issues. This includes assistance not only in areas related to implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements but also in preparing developing countries to participate as equal partners in multilateral trade negotiations, on which discussions should begin in 1999.
Whereas the first edition of the booklet addressed agricultural trade in the narrow sense, this second edition also includes specific sections on FAO's trade-related technical assistance in forestry and fisheries.

The Uruguay Round Agreements and FAO
WHAT THE URUGUAY ROUND ACHIEVED FOR AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES
The Uruguay Round has been described as a turning point in the evolution of agricultural policy. For the first time ever, a large majority of countries agreed a set of principles and disciplines that will help to harmonize both national and international agricultural policies in the future.
The Uruguay Round achievement is contained in a series of agreements and ministerial decisions and declarations annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The annexes
include the:
* Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods;
* General Agreement on Trade in Services;
* Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights;
* Plurilateral Trade Agreements; and
* Ministerial Decisions and Declarations.
The Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods include 13 individual agreements, three of which have particular relevance to FAO's technical activities.
They are the:
* Agreement on Agriculture;
* Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; and
* Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.
FAO's technical activities also have relevance to the:
* Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights; and
* Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries.
Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)
The Agreement on Agriculture is of great significance, as it has brought agriculture into the mainstream of international trade rules.
The three main provisions of the Agreement are aimed at:
* improving market access;
* reducing domestic support; and
* reducing export subsidies.
In all three areas the main thrust is to remove past production- and trade-distorting practices and to facilitate a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system.
A number of agricultural commodities (e.g. rubber) as well as fish and fish products and forest products were not covered by this Agreement.
Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform
Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries
Ministers of countries taking part in the Uruguay Round recognized that the overall results would generate increasing opportunities for trade expansion and economic growth for all participants. They also recognized that, during the reform programme leading to the liberalization of agriculture, the least-developed and net food-importing developing countries might experience negative effects with respect to the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external suppliers on reasonable terms.
The Ministers agreed to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of the Uruguay Round in the area of trade in agriculture would not prevent food aid being available at a level sufficient to assist in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially the least-developed and net food-importing developing countries. To this end, the Ministers agreed to review the level of food aid under the Food Aid Convention; to ensure that an increasing proportion of basic foodstuffs is given to affected countries in fully grant form and/or on appropriate concessional terms; and, in the context of their countries' aid programmes, to give full consideration to requests for the provision of technical and financial assistance to least-developed and net food-importing developing countries so as to improve their agricultural productivity and infrastructure. This last point is of particular relevance to FAO's technical assistance programme.
Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)
The SPS Agreement concerns the application of measures associated with the protection of human, animal and plant health in such a way that they are not a disguised restriction on international trade. This Agreement has particular relevance to plant and animal quarantine measures and to measures taken to ensure food safety.

It recognizes that governments have the right to adopt sanitary and phytosanitary measures but that they should be applied only to the extent necessary to achieve the required level of protection. Governments should not discriminate between members without sufficient scientific evidence, or arbitrarily when identical or similar conditions prevail.
The SPS Agreement encourages countries to adopt international standards.
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)
The TBT Agreement seeks to ensure that technical regulations and standards, including packaging, marking and labelling requirements, and procedures for assessing conformity with technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
It recognizes that a country has the right to take necessary measures, at a level it considers appropriate, to ensure the quality of its exports; the protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health and the environment; and to prevent deceptive practices. A country may also take the necessary steps to ensure that those levels of protection are met, as long as the measures, or action taken to implement them, do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
The provisions of the TBT Agreement do not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures subject to the SPS Agreement, which includes measures to protect human, animal and plant life or health from pests and diseases and food-borne health hazards.
The TBT Agreement encourages countries to adopt international standards.
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
The TRIPS Agreement recognizes that widely varying national standards in the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and the lack of a multilateral framework of principles, rules and disciplines dealing with international trade in counterfeit goods have been a growing source of tension in international trade relations.
Accordingly, it encompasses relevant international intellectual property agreements, provides for adequate intellectual property rights and includes effective enforcement measures to protect those rights.

The FAO-WTO relationship
There are important synergies between FAO and WTO in the area of trade. In many specialized fields FAO has expertise that can be drawn on by WTO and its members, most of whom are also members of FAO. WTO's competence in trade-related matters is a valuable resource for assisting FAO in strengthening its programmes.
One of FAO's key strengths is in its continual monitoring of the global food supply and demand situation. The Organization's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) is a unique source of current information that is useful for implementing the Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries.
FAO's Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus Disposal administers the Organization's Principles of Surplus Disposal, which are included in the disciplines in the Agreement on Agriculture. It is also in a position to provide statistics and to assess the food security situation in connection with provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture relating to export prohibitions and restrictions. All of these subjects are of direct concern to the WTO Committee on Agriculture.
FAO and WTO have a close and expanding working relationship in matters related to sanitary, phytosanitary and food standards. The Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), for which FAO provides the secretariats, are specifically required to collaborate with the SPS and TBT Committees.
FAO plays an important role in addressing environmental matters that have significant implications for trade in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors.
WTO bodies relevant to FAO activities
· General Council
· Council for Trade in Goods
· Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
· Committee on Agriculture
· Committee on Trade and Development
· Committee on Trade and Environment
· Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures
· Committee on Market Access
· Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
· Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade
FAO has observer status in these bodies and actively collaborates with WTO.
FAO expertise relevant to WTO
· Global up-to-date data and information on agriculture, forestry and fisheries
· Food standards (Codex), quality and safety
· Food and agricultural policy analysis
· Commodity market analysis and outlook
· Food security assessments
· Safe use of pesticides and fertilizers
· Conservation of plant and animal genetic resources
· Plant and animal protection
· Sustainable fishery and forestry management
· Land and water conservation
· Environmental impact assessment
· Legal and regulatory matters
FAO is equipped to provide technical assistance to member countries to strengthen their institutional capacity for meeting obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements and for maximizing the resultant benefits.
Within the UN, FAO is the principal source of scientific expertise on a range of environmental matters, including biodiversity which is a subject of paramount concern to the WTO Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and is reflected
in the international Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) which entered into force in December 1993. FAO's intergovernmental Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture is a key body involved in setting priorities and guiding programme activities related to biodiversity and other areas concerning plant and animal
genetic resources.
Almost all current multilateral environmental agreements with trade provisions involve plants and animals (either domesticated or from wild sources). FAO is the repository for a number of those agreements and is
also responsible for related accords
such as the:
* International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources;
* International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides;
* Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries; and
* Model Code of Forest Harvesting Practice.
FAO is also one of the international organizations from which countries request information regarding the extent to which species of flora and fauna are threatened, particularly timber and farm animal species. Safe food processing and production methods as well as ecolabelling are other topics in which FAO has a comparative advantage.

The Uruguay Round and FAO technical assistance
FAO is experienced in providing its members with technical assistance concerning a wide range of WTO-related issues. The Organization's assistance in trade issues dates back to well before the Marrakesh Agreement, and requests have intensified since the Agreement was signed in 1994.
In the area of agricultural and food policy, developing countries are vitally concerned with the implications of the Agreement on Agriculture. Increasingly, FAO is being asked for assistance in capacity building for agricultural policy analysis concerning trade issues. More detailed advice is sought about specific policies, analytical methodologies and ways in which policies might be implemented so that countries can take advantage of trade opportunities and make necessary adjustments to domestic food and agricultural policies. Some FAO members that are not members of WTO have been assisted in policy preparation before formal entry negotiations have taken place.
The obligations of WTO members associated with the SPS and TBT Agreements have resulted in a significant upturn in requests for FAO technical assistance. The adoption by the SPS of Codex Alimentarius standards, guidelines and recommendations as benchmark standards for the international food trade has created a burgeoning interest among developed and developing countries in Codex activities and associated food control matters.
There is a particular interest in strengthening national food control systems, reformulating national food regulations to bring them into conformity with international standards and establishing import/export food inspection and certification programmes to ensure compliance with SPS and TBT requirements.
Training is being sought in relation to SPS and TBT requirements associated with food safety issues, including risk analysis, inspection techniques, analytical methods and food laboratory management. There has also been a growing demand for the capacity of national veterinary services to be strengthened in the field of quantitative import risk analysis techniques. This is a direct response to the SPS Agreement, which stipulates that protective measures must be based on the assessed risk to human, animal or plant health.
To facilitate trade in the context of the SPS, member countries are also seeking FAO's assistance in strengthening their meat import and export inspection programmes. Similarly, in the area of plant protection, assistance has been sought in strengthening and updating the national quarantine programmes of member countries to enable them to meet the demands of plant quarantine developments relating to international trade.
In the area of forestry, FAO provides assistance and support related to technical forestry issues of relevance to the obligations of WTO members under a number of Uruguay Round agreements. Work includes strengthening trade and identifying the consequences of changes in trade restrictions. Long-term outlook studies are conducted to guide policy development, and assessments are made of the implications of trade policies for forest management and vice versa. FAO advises governments on appropriate forest policies both through normative and field project assistance. In particular, by supporting national forest programme processes, it assists many countries in developing appropriate and effective sectoral policies.
World Food Summit
Rome, November 1996
The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action provided an additional impetus to FAO's technical assistance programme on Uruguay Round-related matters. Objective 4.3 of the Plan of Action commits FAO and other organizations to continue assisting developing countries in preparing for future multilateral trade negotiations so that they become "well informed" and equal partners in the [negotiation] process, thus enabling them to benefit fully from their participation and not be disadvantaged.
Further, FAO assists in capacity building in a wide range of areas that have linkages with forestry trade and, therefore, with the Uruguay Round Agreements. It has helped in the development of country staff through its training courses on production, consumption and trade statistics collection and usage, aimed at improving countries' own capabilities in these areas, and it has provided member countries with legal advice in the drafting of forest policies, covering aspects of significance to trade development.
In fisheries, FAO's assistance activities for developing countries have intensified considerably over the last five to seven years, mainly because of the increasing importance of international trade in fishery products and as a result of the strict new sanitary rules imposed by major importing countries. The form of assistance that is most necessary and most often requested is the training of government and industry personnel in inspection and quality assurance of fish and fishery products, including those from aquaculture. The strengthening of national fish inspection systems is also an area where assistance is being sought.
With regard to TRIPS, FAO's technical expertise relates to intellectual property rights in respect of plant varieties, animal breeds, related technology and germplasm. The TRIPS Agreement requires all WTO members to provide plant varietal protection (PVP) either by patents, a sui generis system or a mixture of both. International concern about this matter is increasing rapidly, and many developing countries are seeking technical assistance from FAO with regard to the establishment and implementation of a PVP mechanism. The Organization is also providing technical assistance relating to plant breeding, including forest trees, seed and propagating material production, the safe movement of germplasm, associated legislation, regulations and systems.
FAO's work in the fields of legal advice and legislative drafting undertaken in collaboration with national authorities includes the review and analysis of current statutory instruments governing intellectual property protection and seed production, and the elaboration of draft acts and regulations as well as amendments to existing legislation, including laws governing food control and trade in agricultural, forest and fishery products.
There has been an increase in the number of developing country members of WTO, and several more are in the process of joining. In view of the resultant openness of developing countries' economies, which makes them more dependent on trade developments, there is a growing need to understand the forces that influence such developments. However, most developing countries, especially the least-developed, have neither the capacity nor the resources to face the challenges or take advantage of the opportunities flowing from the Uruguay Round while also preparing themselves for the next round of multilateral trade negotiations. Therefore, arrangements will be necessary to ensure that they receive technical assistance to enable them to prepare adequately for the negotiations ahead.

Agreement on Agriculture
A number of FAO divisions, including the Policy Assistance Division, the Agriculture and Economic Development Analysis Division and the Commodities and Trade Division, have extensive experience in advising countries on agricultural sector and commodity policy. In general their activities include assisting with integrating trade policy into an overall agricultural policy; assessing the implications of the provisions of the bilateral and multilateral policy reforms for world prices, production, consumption and trade in agricultural commodities; and identifying options available for modifying developing countries' trade and domestic policies so that they are compatible with multilateral commitments under the Agreement on Agriculture.
FAO technical assistance in relation to the Agreement on Agriculture falls into two main categories. The first, commodity market assessments and analyses of special issues, especially those of interest to developing countries, includes:
* assessment of the impact of the Agreement on Agriculture on world prices, production, consumption and trade of major food commodities and commodities of export interest to developing countries;
* studies on the impact of world price changes on the food import bills of the least-developed and net food-importing developing countries;
* the identification of export opportunities that may arise for developing country exports as a result of changes in the tariff structure of major developed country markets, including the examination of changes in tariff escalation and prospects for the diversification of agricultural exports; and
* the analysis of issues relating to changes in market fundamentals, namely the composition, ownership
and geographical distribution of commodity stocks, especially stocks of basic foodstuffs and the related issue of changes in world price instability and alternative options available to countries for dealing with price uncertainty.
Food and agricultural policy options for developing countries
Production, consumption and stabilization policies are the three main options available to developing countries for supporting domestic food and agricultural production in a way that is consistent with their commitments under the Agreement on Agriculture.
For production policies, there are two broad instruments available to a country wishing to promote domestic production, namely maintaining tariff levels within the bounds of its commitment under WTO's border measures and providing price and non-price support to farmers within the bounds of its commitment to WTO's domestic support measures. In combination, these instruments allow a considerable degree of flexibility in a country's support to domestic production.
In the case of consumption, the Agreement on Agriculture is relatively permissive regarding policies that are aimed at supporting consumers, especially for developing countries. It allows them to provide foodstuffs at subsidized prices with the objective of meeting food requirements of urban and rural poor in developing countries on a regular basis and at reasonable prices. In some circumstances there is a need to reconcile producer and consumer options.
Regarding stabilization policies, developing countries are concerned about the effect that a more open trade regime might have on domestic price stability, especially that of sensitive food commodities.
The Agreement on Agriculture and general WTO provisions contain a number of options that a developing country may use to mitigate against the full brunt of market instability originating outside its borders. These options include the special safeguards clause of the Agreement on Agriculture, providing for the imposition of additional tariffs in certain circumstances, the variation of tariffs within set bounds, general WTO safeguards, the use of food security stocks, the introduction of export prohibitions under certain circumstances and the use of risk management instruments.
FAO provides advice and guidance to developing countries on the adoption and implementation of the foregoing options in the context of their national food and agricultural policies.
The second category, assessments of the Agreement's implications for trade and domestic food and agricultural policies (on occasions undertaken in collaboration with the World Bank, WTO and regional organizations), includes:
* assessing the implications of Uruguay Round Agreements for export commodities and domestic agricultural markets;
* reviewing current food and agricultural policies in developing countries and the changes that may be required to bring such policies in line with the Agreement on Agriculture;
* examining the implications for regions of a changing external trade environment, including questions of regional integration and preferential schemes;
* assisting in the incorporation of trade policy concerns in the formulation of domestic agricultural policy;
* strengthening national capabilities in policy analysis through training programmes; and
* training farmers' organizations in WTO-related matters.
FAO technical assistance in food and agricultural policy is being delivered at global, regional and country levels.
A manual entitled The implications of the Uruguay Agreement on Agriculture for developing countries has been prepared for training purposes. Workshops on a variety of Uruguay Round-related subjects, some of a policy nature and some product-specific, have been conducted for all regions (Asia and the Pacific, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Near East and North Africa). Training courses have been and are being conducted and round-table discussions have been organized in several countries, including Pakistan, the Sudan, Ethiopia, Zambia and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Forestry and the Agreement on Agriculture
Most forest products were addressed as industrial products in the Uruguay Round negotiations and are therefore not covered by the Agreement on Agriculture. However, in addition to wood products, forestry is concerned with non-wood forest products such as rattan, mushrooms, spices, colourings, gums, sago, fruits, nuts and medicinal plants, many of which enter trade under categories covered by agricultural and food products. Certain forest products, therefore, relate directly to the Agreement on Agriculture and its provisions.
Much of the assistance being provided to least-developed and net food-importing developing countries was also being given before the Marrakesh Agreement.
While FAO has done much to increase its member countries' awareness of the new policy framework introduced by the Uruguay Round, more assistance needs to be given, and indeed is being sought. It is apparent that, in the future, developing countries in particular will require assistance in building and strengthening their capacities to analyse policy options, monitor developments in the world trading system, integrate trade issues in domestic policy formulation and assess the relationship between the multilateral trading system and their commitments to regional trading arrangements.
Fisheries and the Agreement on Agriculture
Fish and fishery products had initially been discussed in the group of natural resource-based products and were later addressed as agricultural products. However, since it was not possible to reach a compromise between certain divergent negotiating positions, to avoid jeopardizing the conclusion of the Agreement on Agriculture, fish and fishery products were excluded from this Agreement. Nevertheless, FAO provides technical assistance and information on international trade in fish and fishery products, including regular assessments of the market situation and outlook for main fishery commodities as well as analyses of pertinent issues. The implications and impact of the Uruguay Round Agreements that are relevant for fisheries have been the subject of several regional seminars and workshops organized by FAO and they are duly taken into account in the Organization's country policy assistance in the fisheries sector.

The Agreements on the Application of
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and
Technical Barriers to Trade
The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) applies to all measures that countries put in place to protect their human, animal and plant life or health, and which may directly or indirectly affect international trade. Essentially, SPS measures are food safety and animal and plant quarantine measures.
The TBT Agreement was developed principally for the purpose of ensuring that technical standards, and procedures for assessing the conformity of those technical standards as well as related regulations, do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
A number of FAO divisions, including the Animal Production and Health Division, the Food and Nutrition Division, the Plant Production and Protection Division and the Research, Extension and Training Division, have extensive experience in assisting member countries with all aspects of the technical and scientific areas of animal health and production, food standards and plant protection embraced by the SPS and TBT Agreements. In general, their activities include providing assistance in:
* the strengthening of national veterinary services to provide them with the capacity and skills to adopt and apply risk analysis techniques effectively;
* the development of national food legislation, taking into account the SPS and TBT Agreements;
* the establishment and strengthening of national food control systems for both imports and exports;
* the formulation of food standards and related measures; and
* the updating of national plant and animal quarantine programmes, taking into consideration the SPS and TBT Agreements and international trade requirements.
CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND INTERNATIONAL PLANT PROTECTION CONVENTION STANDARDS IN
THE APPLICATION OF THE SPS AND TBT AGREEMENTS
It is noteworthy that the SPS and TBT Agreements both acknowledge the importance of harmonizing standards internationally so as to minimize or eliminate the risk of sanitary, phytosanitary and other technical standards becoming barriers to trade.
Article 3.1 of the SPS Agreement states:
"To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, ..."
In its pursuance of harmonization, the SPS Agreement has chosen the international standards, guidelines and recommendations of three organizations as the preferred measures for adoption by WTO members. The secretariats of two of those organizations, the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission and the International Plant Protection Convention, are located within FAO. The former is in the Food and Nutrition Division and the latter is in the Plant Production and Protection Division.
Codex Alimentarius standards
The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is committed to protecting the health of consumers, ensuring fair practices in the food trade and facilitating international trade in food. CAC comprises 157 member countries and, through international negotiation, it has formulated many standards for a wide range of individual food commodities, food safety, pesticide residues, food additives, veterinary drug residues, food contaminants and labelling. It has also elaborated Codes of Hygienic Practice and Principles for food import and export inspection and certification.
The specific recognition of CAC standards, guidelines and recommendations within the SPS Agreement, as well as the place of CAC as an international standardizing body within the context of the TBT Agreement, has stimulated considerable interest in the commission's activities, and developing countries' attendance at Codex meetings has markedly increased. This is a welcome development in the context of both Agreements which direct members, within the limits of their resources, "to play a full part" in the work of relevant international organizations and their subsidiaries.
Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement states:
"Members shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence ..."
A feature of the SPS Agreement is the emphasis it places on the adoption of scientifically based sanitary and phytosanitary measures by member countries.
Who comes to Codex?
w7638e10.gif (14401 bytes)
Through both its global and country-level activities over the past five decades, based on the best scientific evidence available, FAO has provided a wide range of policy and technical guidance to Member Governments.
In the case of food quality and safety issues, for example, a large amount of the food data available to members has been generated by expert consultations, committees and meetings of internationally eminent, independent experts, convened and serviced by FAO. Two such groups are the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.
The activities of FAO-sponsored expert consultations, committees and meetings have done much towards achieving international harmonization of scientifically based and risk-assessed standards; a cardinal objective of both the SPS and TBT Agreements.
In the area of food standards, guidelines and recommendations, FAO provides assistance to member countries by:
* establishing and strengthening national food control systems including the formulation and revision of food legislation (acts and regulations) and food standards in the context of the SPS and TBT Agreements;
* conducting a wide range of workshops and training courses, not only for transferring information, knowledge and skills, but also with the intention of increasing awareness among developing countries, in particular, of the importance of their complying with SPS and TBT measures if they are to benefit from participating in the international food trade;
* strengthening laboratory analysis and food inspection capabilities;
* providing training in all aspects of food control associated with SPS and TBT requirements, including the skills necessary to ensure compliance with those requirements;
* presenting papers at conferences and symposia on the relevance of SPS and TBT measures to the international food trade;
* extending guidance on matters directly generated by the SPS and TBT measures, including the safety assessment of food produced with biotechnology;
* providing advice, information and documents on a wide range of SPS- and TBT-related matters such as the concepts of "equivalency", "transparency" and "risk";
* developing and publishing the Manuals of food quality control, which provide recommendations for the development and operation of food quality and safety systems - matters of extreme importance in the context of the SPS and TBT Agreements. These manuals are aimed primarily at providing advice to developing countries, and they document current approaches to food quality control directed at protecting the health of consumers and facilitating international trade, which are principal objectives of the SPS Agreement. Key titles in the series include Food inspection, Food for export, Management of food control programmes and Imported food inspection;
* assisting with the establishment and strengthening of food control agencies and with the technical and administrative and technical skills necessary to ensure their effective operation;
* developing and publishing training manuals in the area of fish inspection and quality assurance, particularly concerning application of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept in the fish industry. Key titles include: Assurance of seafood quality, The need for fish inspection and quality assurance, and Quality and quality changes in fresh fish;
* providing assistance in the strengthening of administrative structures such as:
- Codex Contact Points in member countries to ensure effective information exchange and communication in matters related to food standards and other CAC activities;
- National Codex Committees to encourage and support participation in the international pursuit of harmonization of food standards;
Food quality control
FAO technical assistance in food control and food standards is being delivered at global, regional and country levels. The Manuals of food quality control are used internationally, while workshops, seminars and meetings have been and are being conducted in the regions of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Near East and North Africa on SPS- and TBT-related subjects such as strengthening food control and its administration as well as the implications of these two Agreements for food control and the international food trade. SPS- and TBT-related technical training has been conducted at both national and regional levels in food inspection, food analysis and laboratory management, all aspects of food hygiene and safety and import/export food control strategies.
* promoting enhanced cooperation between government food control agencies and the food industry to ensure that, through an understanding of and compliance with SPS and TBT measures, food trade is facilitated rather than obstructed; and
* assisting both governments and national food industries in minimizing the risk of health hazards associated with food for local consumption and for export (in order to meet the requirements of importing countries) by providing training in overall food quality systems, including the HACCP system for controlling hazards that are significant for food safety.
In pursuing the harmonization of plant health measures, the SPS specifies adoption by members of international standards, guidelines and recommendations developed under the auspices of the IPPC secretariat in cooperation with regional organizations operating within the framework of the Convention.
International Plant Protection Convention
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) came into force in 1952, was amended in 1979 and revised again in 1997. The IPPC currently lists 106 contracting parties, and the revision allowed for the European Community also to become a contracting party.
Recent changes to the Convention reflect the relationship it now has with WTO through the SPS Agreement. A revised text was adopted by the Conference of FAO in November 1997.
As a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the IPPC's information, collection and dissemination function, as well as its role of coordinating Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPOs), has been extended to setting international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs).
Consequently, contracting parties to the Convention and RPPOs requested FAO to create an IPPC secretariat. The secretariat was established within FAO in 1992. Its functions are to:
* promote the development and use of international standards for phytosanitary measures;
* facilitate the sharing of information concerning phytosanitary requirements, pest status, national contact points and other relevant data;
* organize technical consultations among RPPOs; and
* provide technical assistance in implementing the provisions of the Convention.
The secretariat is assisted by the Committee of Experts on Phytosanitary Measures (CEPM), an international panel of experts on harmonization and plant quarantine and various ad hoc working groups with particular areas of expertise.
Standards drafted by the secretariat and working groups are reviewed by the CEPM before being submitted to the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures for adoption.
Plant protection
FAO technical assistance for plant protection in relation to international trade is being delivered at global, regional and country levels. The development through the IPPC and RPPOs of international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs) to be adopted globally is directed at facilitating safe international trade and eliminating the use of unjustified phytosanitary measures as barriers to trade. At the regional level - for example, East Africa - cooperation between national plant protection inspectorates has resulted in "networking", involving the sharing of information and resources and resulting in an increased harmonization of measures and procedures. In many countries, such as Ghana, the training of plant quarantine officers, the drafting of new plant protection regulations and the preparation of training manuals are substantially improving the ability of the national plant protection organization to provide for safe trade in an expanding plant industry.
The IPPC secretariat is developing standards in a seven-part framework encompassing import regulations, export certification, compliance procedures, pest surveillance, exotic pest response, pest management and post-entry quarantine. Within this framework, the secretariat has completed Guidelines for Pest Risk Analysis, a Code of Conduct for the Import and Release of Exotic Biological Control Agents, Requirements for the Establishment of Pest-Free Areas, Principles of Plant Quarantine as Related to International Trade and Guidelines for Surveillance and Export Certification Systems.
Provision is made in the revised Convention for the establishment of a Commission on Phytosanitary Measures which advises the secretariat concerning the activities, direction and priorities of the IPPC, and approves and adopts standards which, in the past, were adopted and approved by the governing bodies of FAO.
The revised Convention also expands the concept of phytosanitary measures to provide for both quarantine pests and regulated non-quarantine pests. This change reflects a high degree of alignment with the scope of protection found in the SPS Agreement.
In the area of plant protection, as related to international trade, FAO is providing assistance to member countries by:
* explaining and interpreting the relationship between plant protection and international trade, particularly with respect to obligations under international agreements, especially the IPPC and SPS;
* helping with the adjustment and administration of plant protection and plant quarantine programmes to conform to IPPC and SPS obligations;
* helping upgrade the plant quarantine services of members by improving infrastructure, increasing the technical skills of staff and streamlining administrative procedures;
* providing training for personnel, at both national and regional levels, in scientifically based plant quarantine procedures as well as pest risk analysis and related methodologies to help ensure that adopted phytosanitary measures are scientifically sound and justified;
* reviewing and strengthening quarantine legislation to harmonize it with internationally acceptable principles and standards;
* providing member countries that are developing pest control and quarantine services with basic facilities for inspection and pest treatment;
* guiding the planning and establishment of survey systems to determine the nature and extent of pest and quarantine problems; and
* developing international standards for phytosanitary measures for global adoption and encouraging the harmonization of such measures with the aim of facilitating safe trade and avoiding the use of unjustified phytosanitary measures as barriers to trade.
ANIMAL HEALTH
The SPS Agreement emphasizes the importance of assessing risk as a prerequisite to the determination of appropriate levels of sanitary and phytosanitary protection.
The SPS Agreement also requires members to ensure that the sanitary and phytosanitary measures they apply are not more trade-restrictive than is required to achieve the appropriate level of protection.
Article 5.1 of the SPS Agreement states:
"Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations."
Risk assessment is particularly relevant in the trading of animals. Under the SPS, the complete negation of risk by arbitrarily placing a comprehensive prohibition on the entry of all livestock from selected countries is no longer acceptable. Consequently, it has become essential for all animal health services to be proficient in quantitative import risk analysis (QIRA) techniques. Countries must be able to demonstrate that their disease surveillance is sufficiently capable and their control capacity adequate to meet the requirements of importing countries.
In the field of animal health, FAO is assisting member countries by:
* providing assistance through consultants and training in basic risk analysis, disease risk analysis and risk communication at training courses and workshops conducted regionally and nationally;
* helping to strengthen the infrastructure and expertise of animal health services to enable them to undertake disease surveillance proficiently and effectively;
* giving advice and guidance on regional training required to improve disease control and achieve acceptable levels of incidence in the context of importing country requirements and SPS principles;
* at both national and regional levels, assisting with the design of disease control programmes that are based on risk analysis and take into account epidemiological principles;
* presenting papers at conferences and meetings on risk assessment associated with animal health in general and in such subjects as veterinary vaccines;
* assisting countries of Africa in the rationalization of public and private sector veterinary service responsibilities in order to meet WTO requirements for the reduction of agricultural subsidies, the liberalization of animal health inputs, the privatization of selected services and strengthening the public sector for carrying out its animal and public health responsibilities. Similar activities have been or will be undertaken in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Near East and North Africa, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific;
* assisting with the organization of regional animal disease networks, involving both the supply of equipment and the training of personnel;
Animal health
FAO technical assistance in animal health is being delivered at global, regional and country levels. FAO provides the secretariat for the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) as well as providing the Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal Diseases (EMPRES). A global system (EMPRESGEWS) for the surveillance and reporting of transboundary animal diseases is being developed as part of EMPRES. At all three levels, FAO provides training, conducts workshops and prepares manuals on a wide range of animal health matters. Manuals produced cover quality control of the manufacture of veterinary vaccines and phar-maceuticals, animal disease diagnosis, animal quarantine, disease control, feed and forage safety, animal health laws and regulations and disease control strategies.
* providing training in the strengthening of disease surveillance and quantitative epidemiology, and in the organization and implementation of related services in both animal-importing and animal-exporting countries;
* its membership of the secretariat of the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT) for coordination among research institutions, national trypanosomiasis and tetse control services and funding and technical development organizations that aim to promote agriculture and health in trypanosomiasis-affected areas;
* in conjunction with the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) and WHO, assembling and disseminating global animal disease status data and assisting member countries to improve the quality of disease surveillance information;
* on request, advising member countries' veterinary services departments on the control or prevention of specific infectious, non-infectious and parasitic diseases, as well as on the delivery of veterinary services at the field level, and rationalizing veterinary service departments at the national level; and
* providing recommendations for avoiding farm livestock infections and intoxications associated with feed and forage, particularly with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Animal and fishery production
FAO technical assistance in animal and fishery production has mostly been delivered at regional and country levels. In sub-Saharan Africa and the English-speaking Caribbean, for example, regional training courses have been conducted in meat inspection.
At the country level, in Thailand and Jamaica professionals have been trained in analytical techniques relating to meat and meat products. In Laos and Barbados assistance has been given in the formulation of meat sanitation laws and regulations.
In fisheries it is estimated that, since 1989, more than 3 000 government and industry fish technologists, inspectors and other quality controllers from more than 80 developing countries in Africa, Asia and the South Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean have been trained at different levels in HACCP-related workshops and seminars organized by FAO's Fish Utilization and Marketing Service.
ANIMAL PRODUCTION
The quantities of meat and meat products moving in international trade are substantial and of economic importance to both exporting and importing countries. As a consequence of disease and food safety considerations associated with meat and meat products, provisions of the SPS Agreement are of particular significance, and it is essential that importing and exporting countries ensure that their trade operations are within the bounds of those provisions.
In the area of animal production, FAO is providing assistance to developing countries by:
* training veterinarians and veterinary assistants in meat inspection in both importing and exporting countries;
* helping establish laboratories for residue testing (pesticide and veterinary drug residues and contaminants) and training of analysts in related methodology;
* helping to establish and upgrade abattoirs and meat processing plants to meet importing countries' requirements; and
* providing technical assistance to improve meat quality and meat product handling and inspection so that it complies with the most stringent import requirements.
FORESTRY
The SPS and TBT Agreements have a special relevance to forestry. The SPS Agreement addresses issues of concern relating to trade in unprocessed or slightly processed products such as logs, sawnwood, wood chips and particles. These products are regularly the subject of trade disputes concerning phytosanitary issues. Forestry biodiversity, biotechnology and genetic issues also have linkages with the SPS Agreement.
The provisions of the TBT Agreement are of significance to trade in wood products such as sawnwood and wood-based panels, which are often used as structural materials for buildings and furniture and therefore have safety implications. Additionally, of considerable interest to forestry are TBT technical regulations and standards covering packaging, marking and labelling, especially those connected with certification and ecolabelling, all areas where there are many uncertainties for forest products at present.
FISHERIES
FAO's Fish Utilization and Marketing Service operates a comprehensive training programme in the field of fish utilization and quality control. The main objective of the programme is to train other trainers. This means training those who are in a position to apply the knowledge gained, and hence contribute to countries' self-reliance and sustainability.
In 1986, the programme started to focus on the HACCP system as applied to the fishery industry. The core activities of this programme are the execution of courses, workshops and seminars and the development of training material relevant to developing countries' needs.

Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights
The TRIPS Agreement, adopted as part of the Marrakesh Agreement, contains minimum standards for the protection of almost all areas of intellectual property. WTO member countries failing to comply with these standards may be subject to dispute settlement procedures within WTO and eventually to trade sanctions.
FAO's main interest in the TRIPS Agreement relates to intellectual property rights over plant varieties, animal breeds, related technologies and germplasm, and it is in these areas that FAO has technical expertise.
The Plant Production and Protection Division and the Animal Production and Health Division of FAO have extensive experience in assisting member countries with those aspects of TRIPS associated with genetic resources conservation and utilization, seed policies and programmes and plant and animal breeding. The Development Law Service of the FAO Legal Office assists member countries with seed and propagating material legislation and regulations, plant varietal protection (PVP) legislation, including sui generis systems, and plant breeders' and farmers' rights.
Part 3 of the TRIPS Agreement sets out the obligations for Member Governments to provide procedures and remedies under their domestic law that:
· ensure intellectual property rights can be effectively enforced by foreign rights holders as well as by nationals; and
· permit effective action against the infringement of intellectual rights that are fair and equitable, not unnecessarily complicated or costly and do not entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays.
FAO's observer status on the TRIPS Council of WTO reflects the importance of its role in helping member countries meet their obligations under the Agreement.
FAO's Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture has a specific interest in the implications and implementation of Article 27.3(b) of the TRIPS Agreement, which requires all WTO members to provide PVP either by patents or a sui generis system, or a mixture of both, with the provision that their actions will be subject to review four years after the entry into force of the WTO Agreement. The obligation of WTO's developing country members to adopt PVP has important implications for the development of their agricultural economies and trade. The provision for review, which takes effect from 1 January 1999, has generated both interest and concern about action to be taken, and many countries are seeking technical advice and assistance.
FAO technical assistance to developing countries in relation to TRIPS is focused on assisting national authorities in analysing their needs and identifying appropriate policy options; formulating or revising national legislation; and advising on the structure and functions of the institutions involved.
FAO's experience over many years has shown that justice cannot be done to the particular needs and circumstances of individual countries by theoretical studies or model laws. Sui generis systems can be developed to suit the need of individual countries.
In TRIPS-related matters, FAO provides:
1) Technical assistance:
i) advising Member Governments on their plant breeding and seed and planting material production legislation, regulations and systems;
ii) defining criteria for the formulation and implementation of regional and national seed policies and programmes;
iii) assisting with variety maintenance and replacement; and
iv) advising on technical aspects of seed testing, certification and variety protection in relation to plant breeders' rights.
2) Legal assistance:
* providing developing countries with a broad range of legal advice on the drafting of legislation. This involves close collaboration with the national authorities and normally includes the following steps:
i) reviewing and analysing the statutory instruments in force (or draft bills) and the institutional framework governing intellectual property protection (with specific reference to seeds) and seed production (including quality control, marketing and export and import);
ii) identifying the specific objectives to be attained for the proposed legislation in the light of the government's priorities;
iii) elaborating a draft act and regulations, or amendments to the existing legislation;
iv) submitting recommendations and their discussion with the relevant national authorities;
* assisting with the formulation of national legislation to protect plant varieties. This has involved:
i) analysing national needs and identifying appropriate policy options;
ii) reviewing existing legislation; and
iii) advising on the structure and functions of implementing agencies;
* supporting workshops and meetings on both technical and legal matters relevant to the TRIPS Agreement.

Costs and funding of Uruguay
Round-related technical assistance
Costs associated with providing technical assistance associated with Uruguay Round follow-up vary widely. Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) projects such as those associated with SPS and TBT issues, including assistance in strengthening food control and plant protection services and in training veterinarians in risk assessment, may vary from US$50 000 to as much as US$200 000.
Costs are determined by factors such as the length of the project, the number of specialist consultants involved and the depth at which the subject matter is covered.
The delivery costs of projects involving the development of policy and its implementation associated with, for example, the Agreement on Agriculture, also vary widely. An examination of the implications of the Uruguay Round for export commodities and for domestic support policies of a developing country may cost in the order of US$50 000, while the cost of assistance for a comprehensive agricultural sector policy reform in a developing country may exceed
US$350 000, although such projects usually amount to US$200 000. Projects to assist countries in strengthening their own institutional capacity for analysing trade policies, and involving sensitization seminars for senior policy-makers, training courses for policy officers and local studies on the impact of various trade scenarios on the agricultural sector, may cost between US$150 000 and US$250 000.
Where capital expenditure is involved, such as that associated with supplying equipment and buildings (e.g. analytical equipment and laboratories to house it), assistance costs escalate.
Workshops and meetings in connection with Uruguay Round Agreements that are fully sponsored by FAO may cost up to US$4 000 per participant to conduct.
FUTURE REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE
It is anticipated that member countries' requests for FAO technical assistance associated with the Uruguay Round Agreements will increase rather than decline in the foreseeable future, some reasons for this being:
* an increasing awareness of signatory countries to the Uruguay Round Agreements of the need to understand fully what their obligations entail;
* the continuing endeavour of some developing countries - about 30 - to weigh the options of whether or not to join WTO;
* recognition by developing countries of the importance of enhancing their capacity to take advantage of current and potential opportunities in the world agricultural commodity market created by Uruguay Round Agreements;
* the need to design new policies and adjust old ones to comply with the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture while, at the same time, supporting farmers and providing some targeted support to poor consumers;
* a desire by developing countries to participate effectively in further rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, on which discussion should begin in 1999;
* the need for countries to adjust their mandatory food, plant and animal import requirements to comply with both the spirit and substance of the SPS and TBT Agreements, thereby avoiding challenges from exporting countries;
* an urgent requirement of some countries for training in sound science to enable compliance with provisions of the SPS and TBT Agreements;
* the obligation for signatory countries to the TRIPS Agreement to adopt PVP measures available for review from
1 January 1999.
It is estimated that, in addition to FAO member countries that have already received or are currently receiving WTO-related technical assistance, in the next three years a further 30 countries and groups of countries will require technical assistance at an approximate cost of
US$5 million. While it is expected that part of this assistance can be financed under FAO's TCP, the remainder will require funding from other sources.
SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The major source of finance for technical assistance related to Uruguay Round Agreements has been the FAO Regular Programme budget, including TCP funding. Some extrabudgetary and trust fund monies have been contributed by other international organizations and donor countries for conducting workshops and symposia on Uruguay Round Agreements.
Because of financial constraints limiting its capacity to provide all technical assistance sought from its Regular Programme budget, FAO seeks financial support from donor countries and international organizations through trust fund and other arrangements. This expectation springs from the spirit of cooperation pervading the Uruguay Round negotiations as well as specific declarations in various Uruguay Round Agreements committing developed countries to assisting developing countries in becoming fully fledged partners in the global trading system.
An important objective of FAO is to promote international trade and further the development of the world economy. Accordingly, FAO remains dedicated to supporting the international trade regime resulting from the Uruguay Round negotiations and will continue to maximize technical assistance to its member countries within its budgetary capabilities.

<title>Inter-regional project for participatory upland conservation and development (Field Document 4/97) - Nepal - Participatory implementation in 1996 and 1997 of 26 community action plans formulated between october 1995 and january 1996 in the Bhusunde Khola watershed</title>
<section>1</section>
1.1 Background
The "Inter-regional Project for Participatory Upland Conservation and Development", GCP/INT/542/ITA (or PUCD project), aims at promoting people's participation in the conservation and development of upland catchments, in accordance with HMG's policies and priorities. The project became operational in the second half of 1992, and has gone through several participatory rural appraisal and participatory activity planning and implementation cycles. The three main categories of project activities are:
(i) Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and participatory planning, and participatory monitoring and evaluation of planned activities;
(ii) Capacity building of user groups, which are the accepted community organizational units through which participatory field activities are implemented; and
(iii) Participatory implementation of field activities identified and requested by local communities through participatory planning methods (the main subject of this report).
The most comprehensive PRA and participatory planning exercise carried out during the project, covered 26 communities with about 8850 inhabitants of the Bhusunde Khola watershed^1 of Gorkha District (see Chapter 2.1 and Field Document 3/97). The PRAs were organized between October 1995 and January 1996, and resulted in 26 Community Action Plans (CAPs), which included 223 physical and training activities.
^1The Bhusunde Khola sub-watershed ranges from 500 - 1500 m in altitude and is located in the Middle Hills of Gorkha District. It has a total area of 32 km^2, covers 23 Wards of 4 Village Development Committees (VDC's), and has a population of approximately 12,000. There are no roads in the area and all transport is done on foot. No recent or detailed maps exist or could be used for planning or implementation purposes, except for the 1962 maps prepared by the Surveyor General of India, based on 1:80,000 air photographs taken in 1957.
This combination of a large number of CAPs covering 70-75 % of the population of a watershed is the closest thing we have to a participatory watershed management plan. It has many drawbacks, such as limited time frame, poor spatial integration of activities, and little homogeneity. However, it is the genuine product of a participatory planning process.
Gradual improvement of local capacity for planning and implementation of development activities is obtained by repeatedly going through cycles of capacity building training, participatory planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Thus, it should be realized that a participatory (and integrated) watershed management plan looks quite different from a "traditional" watershed management plan, and more like a strategy, indicating working methods and target areas rather than fixed targets and zonations.
Implementation of these 26 CAPs became the main project focus during 1996. A high implementation rate was considered essential to prove the validity of the participatory development process, both at the field level and at the level of the Department of Soil Conservation.

1.2 Objective
The objective of this report is to document and report the participatory implementation of the 26 Community Action Plans of the Bhusunde Khola watershed as prepared by the local population through participatory planning methods between October 1995 and January 1996, and as implemented by the user groups with the assistance of the project in 1996 and the first half of 1997.
The report does not include the participatory implementation of: (i) Those activities that had been started before 1996, but could only be finished in 1996 or even 1997; (ii) New activities added through the Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning workshops conducted between October and December 1996; nor (iii) Additional activities taken up to cope with unforseen situations (i.e. to assist communities in certain sensitive areas, not fulfilling the criteria for implementation).

2.1 1995/96 PRA and planning exercise
The main objective of the Participatory Rural Appraisal carried out in the Bhusunde Khola watershed between October 1995 and January 1996, was to improve the understanding of the local communities of their own situation, living conditions and environment in general, and their local resources, land use, farming systems, constraints and opportunities in particular, in order to set the stage for a participatory planning of development activities that would fit into an integrated and participatory watershed management plan (see Field Document 3/97).
The main objective of the Participatory Planning carried out together with the PRA was to prepare detailed plans for upland conservation and development activities to be implemented by the local population with the support of the project, and which would form the core of an integrated and participatory watershed management plan.
Field Document 3/97 presents the results of that PRA and planning exercise. It also describes methods and tools used and organizational aspects. The size of the communities where PRA's were conducted was small, usually between 30 and 80 households, and the duration of the PRA's was limited, especially to allow women to fully take part in the exercise. Data are presented on:
(a) Population and demography, including ethnic composition, literacy rates and local food sufficiency;
(b) Farming systems and landuse, including data on landuse categories;
(c) Crops and agricultural production, cropping patterns, seasonality, trend in productivity, problems and opportunities;
(d) Livestock and animal husbandry, numbers of animals per household, trends in livestock population, fodder and feed preferences, problems and opportunities;
(e) Forests and natural resources, including a summary of soil and water resources problem areas.
The 26 PRA communities have a total population of approximately 8,850 people, the whole watershed is estimated to have a population close to 12,000. The PRA focussed on settlements on the slopes and ridges of the watershed, and did not include settlements in the valley bottom (such as Bhusunde Bazaar).
As appears from the PRA data, there is a large diversity in the watershed, this concerns not only the natural variation of mountainous areas (slope, altitude, exposition, soil, and so on), but also sociological, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it should be noted that in general the whole population of the watershed should be considered as poor.

2.2.1 Participatory planning methods and tools used
Before starting the actual participatory planning of activities, the results of the PRA generated data were presented to the community for verification and comments in a feed-back or restitution meeting. This is also the starting point of the Village Planning Workshops, during which the following exercises were carried out, resulting in the formulation of a Community Action Plan (see also Field Document 3/97):
1. Verbal ranking of problems, during which a list of problems is drawn up (ideally this list should closely reflect the results of the presentation of the PRA data), this list also includes opportunities for improvement;
2. Prioritization of problems, which consists of a broad discussion and reshuffling of the listed problems;
3. Listing of activities, based on the prioritized problem and opportunity list; and
4. Prioritization of activities, based on the listed activities and a broad discussion on actual possibilities to carry out such activities.
2.2.2 CAP structure
The 26 Community Action Plans all follow the same structure. They indicate in the form of a table what the planned activities are, where they should be done within the communities, when they should be done, the number of beneficiary households, what the project should do, what other institutions should do, and what the community should do (see Table 1).
However, further analyses indicates that many activities are hidden, as can be seen from the Majhgaon (Chhoprak #7) example in Table 1 (see also Field Document 3/97 Table 24). Though only 6 activities are listed in the first column, further analysis of the 5th and 6th columns reveals some hidden activities, notably compost making training, forest management training and study tour, and fodder and forage training. Furthermore, it should be noted that there is a link between the different activities: waste water from protected water sources will be used in vegetable production; the forest should be protected and on-farm fodder production increased.

It is also important to note that other institutions than the project are expected to be involved in the realization of the CAPs, most often mentioned are the District Forest, Agriculture Development, Livestock Services and Drinking Water Supply Offices.
2.2.3 Types of activities included in the CAPs
The CAPs include many separate (but often inter-related) activities, including:
(a) Conservation activities, such as gully and landslide control, forest handover and management, conservation plantation and improved stoves;
(b) Small scale infrastructures, such as water source protection, water catchment ponds, small scale hill irrigation and trail improvement;
(c) Farming systems oriented activities, like livestock breed improvement, plantation of grasses, fodder, fruit, vegetables, nursery, and related training activities;
(d) Income generating activities, like vegetable and animal production and commercialization; and
(e) Social services, like the construction of community houses, a health center, latrines and adult literacy classes.
It should be noted that several factors influenced the planning process, most notably:
(i) Expectations of the local population of the kind of activities the project would (be able to) support.
(ii) Project policy on terms and conditions for the participatory implementation of activities, such as levels of subsidy. Here it should be noted that the project amended its implementation and subsidy policy shortly after completion of the PRA. Subsequently several communities/user groups wanted to amend their CAPs likewise.
(iii) The whole participatory planning procedure itself, and its focus on communities and user groups, favours the selection of activities that will benefit communities rather than individual households.
2.2.4 Size of CAPs
The 26 CAPs included a total of 223 activities, of which 177 could be defined as physical activities, and 46 as training activities (Table 2.). The number of activities per CAP was on average 8,6 and varied from only 1, in Nawalpur (Harmi #6) to 18, in Belbas (Khoplang #4).

Physical activities usually form the core of the CAPs. There were on average 3.8 times more physical activities than training activities in the PRAs, and only in 1 case were there more training than physical activities planned, namely in Nawalpur (Harmi #6). The were on average 6.8 physical activities, ranging from 0 in Nawalpur^2 (Harmi #6), to 14 in Belbas (Khoplang #4).
^2 In fact the Nawalpur PRA and Planning exercise was dominated by a few "radicals", who seemed to oppose any other activities than those proposed by themselves, i.e. improved stoves training.
Training activities were often hidden as accompaniment to physical activities. This reflects also the role of the facilitator. In a number of CAPs the planned number of training activities was very low, though other CAPs with similar physical activities also included specific and related training activities. This factor is particularly important in the organization of training events (i.e. communities that did not include training in their CAP should be invited for training events relevant to their physical activities). There were on average 1.7 training activities planned per CAP, ranging from 0 in Simpani (Ampipal #6), Chitre (Chhoprak #1), Katarbari (Chhoprak #3), Salbot (Chhoprak M), Faudargaon (Chhoprak #5), Firfire (Chhoprak #8), Harmi Bhanjang (Harmi #3) and Khurpajung (Khoplang #4), to 6 in Katubanse (Chhoprak #9).

2.3.1. Physical activities included in the CAPs
A physical activity is defined here as any activity with a direct physical component, such as construction, planting, providing improved genetic (breeding) material, handing over and management of forest. In fact, this category includes all activities except training and group formation.
A total of 177 physical activities were included in the 26 CAPs (see Table 3). The most popular activity, by far, was water source protection, with 52 sources included in the plans, though it is remarkable that none were planned in Ampipal VDC (maybe because of the presence of UMN community health programs).
Trail improvement, included 24 times, was the second most popular activity. Here it is important to note that trail improvement was most frequently included in the plans by communities living higher up the slopes, such as Chitre (Chhoprak #1).
Small scale hill irrigation was the third most frequently planned activity. It is likely that this activity is strongly limited by actual water resources, otherwise many more communities would have included it in their plans.
Gully and landslide control was mentioned 15 times. It is much more frequently included in the south facing slopes of the watershed.

Forest handover (community forestry) is included 10 times, and conservation plantation 6 times. These plantations are sometimes meant to improve the community forests and sometimes to help stabilize gullies and landslides.
Improvement of buffalo and especially goat was mentioned a number of times. The improved goats would generally be targeted at women and women groups.
Planting trees, fodder, fruit, grasses, bamboo, cardamom, vegetables, etc., is included in many CAPs. Many variations exist, such as planting on private farm land, communal lands, in gullies, forests, along streams, etc.
It is remarkable that none of the CAPs included plans to increase the availability of improved paddy or maize seed, fertilizer, pesticides or other food production enhancing interventions, except for irrigation facilities. It is not clear why this is so, maybe farmers do not realize that crop production is very low (less likely), or maybe they only see irrigation as a solution upon which all other improvements would depend (more likely).
2.3.2 Criteria for project assistance
As stated before, user groups are the appropriate and accepted community organization units through which participatory field activities of the Department of Soil Conservation (or any other line agency) are to be implemented. At the beginning of the Second Phase (end 1994) there were about 35 user groups in the Bhusunde Khola watershed, however, many of these were not functioning properly.
The project considered that it was not sustainable to work with purely input driven user groups, who otherwise hardly function. Therefore criteria were set early in 1996 for user groups who wished to solicit project assistance. It was decided to work only with active user groups defined by:
(i) Regular meetings;
(ii) Record keeping; and
(iii) Regular group savings.
Later another criterium was added:
(iv) Self initiated activities.
Thus, even in communities where PRAs had been carried out and CAPs had been prepared, the project insisted that it would only extend its assistance in physical activity implementation to active user groups according to the above set criteria. In case the community was eager to implement the physical activities foreseen in the CAPs, but was not properly organized in user groups fulfilling the criteria, the project offered specific capacity building training.
2.3.3 Cost sharing and people's contribution
Basically, only field activities identified and requested by local communities through participatory planning methods have been supported by the project since its inception. Modalities for cost sharing and participatory implementation of field activities have not remained constant throughout this period, though in general user groups contributed un-skilled labour and local materials, and the project contributed skilled labour and outside materials. During the first phase, the project tried to stimulate user groups by providing them with cash equivalent to 10% of the total estimated costs of specific -usually small scale infrastructure- activities, which should have been used as revolving funds (and which did not have the desired results).
During 1995 user groups were required to deposit 5% of the total estimated costs of such activities in their bank account before the start of the activity. After completion of the works an equal sum of money was deposited on the same accounts by the project. Several problems arose with this system:
(i) Poor communities could not manage to collect enough funds;
(ii) In some cases relatively wealthy people provided the 5% funds, and were later reimbursed by the user group upon completion of the activities and receipt of the additional 5% of the project;
(iii) Only in a few cases did the revolving funds actually work, more often it gave rise to mistrust and misunderstanding (and sometimes misuse) in the user groups; and
(iv) Villagers lost interest in activities that require very high levels of unskilled labour and low levels of external inputs, notably trail improvement and gully and landslide control.
It was therefore decided in February 1996 to amend the project activities implementation strategy, no longer to require cash deposits for infrastructure activities, and to streamline subsidy and cost sharing policies with the other district level line agencies' norms and policies as follows:
(a) Gully and torrent control, people's contribution in the form of unskilled labour would amount to no less than 25-30% of the total cost;
(b) Trail improvement, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would amount to no less than 40% of the total cost;
(c) Water source protection/water supply and small scale hill irrigation, people's contribution would include all un-skilled labour (including labour for the supply of local material), while the project would provide skilled labour and external materials;
(d) Degraded land rehabilitation, people's contribution would consist of pitting and "social fencing", the project would provide planting material;
(e) Fruit tree planting, when fruit trees were to be planted in rehabilitation schemes, people would be charged 50% of the nursery cost, when fruit trees were to be privately planted as a pure income generating activity, people would be charged 100% of the nursery cost, and the project would arrange for transport;
(f) River bank and road stabilization, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would be not less than 1 5-20% of total costs;
(g) On farm conservation, in general, people's contribution in the form of un-skilled labour would amount to at least 50% of the total costs (except for those activities that fall under above mentioned categories, where the said subsidy rates would apply);
(h) Other activities within the scope of the Department of Soil Conservation, as a general rule, external materials and skilled labour would be provided by the project and un-skilled labour as people's contribution; and
(i) Livestock improvement, the project would arrange for transport only.
2.3.4 Participatory feasibility analysis
After completion of the 95/96 PRA and Planning exercise, it was evident that the list of activities proposed by the CAPs needed to be further screened through a participatory feasibility analysis. This was done in the period of February - April 1996.
The participatory feasibility analysis focussed on social, technical and environmental aspects, while economic aspects were considered less relevant:
(i) Social aspects includes the verification whether direct stake holders actually agree with every detail of the proposed activity, e.g. landowners should agree that a water pipe will run through their land.
(ii) Technical aspects includes the verification whether the proposed activity is technically possible, e.g. whether water for a proposed small scale hill irrigation scheme can actually reach the farm land, and whether it will be enough to irrigate the proposed area.
(iii) Environmental aspects includes the verification whether the proposed activity will have a positive or negative impact on the environment, e.g. whether a proposed trail will increase the risk of a landslide or provoke gully formation.
(iv) Economic aspects. To date, the project has not carried out actual economic feasibility analysis. Only a minority of proposed activities would qualify for such an analysis (i.e. income generating activities), but there is also a clear reluctance to carry out such analysis (i.e. the local conviction that nothing in the hills of Nepal is economically feasible). However, intrinsic economic criteria have been used in the feasibility study, notably the numbers of beneficiary households as compared to cost of activities.
Apart from these, the earlier stated project criteria for user groups and cost sharing were also utilized as screening tools. Finally, it was realized that some CAPs were far too ambitious to be carried out in 1 or even 2 years, and therefor the criterium of available local workforce (manpower) was added.
The participatory feasibility analysis were carried out by the Area Facilitators of the project, mid-level technicians of multi-disciplinary backgrounds: rangers (foresters), an overseer (engineering) and a junior technician agriculture. Regular back-stopping support was provided by the senior project staff.
The results of the participatory feasibility analysis and related screening methods are presented in Table 4. A total of 81 physical activities, or 46% was screened out: 9 (5%) were outside the project mandate; 24 (14%) were not feasible for social, technical or economical reasons; 16 (9%) could not be done because the user groups did not (want to) fulfill the criteria; and 32 (18%) were "postponed" because there was not enough labour available in the community to complete them (in fact more had to be postponed, but only from 1996 to 1997).
Of the engineering activities (gully control, trail improvement, water source protection, irrigation and catchment ponds), which with 121 proposed activities made up 68% of the physical activities in the CAPs, a total of 62, equivalent to 51% was screened out. The main problem in gully control is the high cost and large amount of labour required. Trails are especially labour intensive, but usually otherwise feasible. Proposed irrigation schemes and ponds often do not meet technical requirements.
Forest handover and management (community forestry) is sometimes not feasible because of social conflicts (user rights). Forest plantations (conservation forests) were often not feasible, because the project insisted on effective social fencing before it would agree to make any payments to user groups. Those that were feasible were part of more elaborate gully control works.
Improved breeding animals was considered not a project activity in the case of buffalo's, here farmers could apply for specific loans with other institutions. Improved goats however was retained, because this activity particularly benefits women groups.

Usually all planting activities are feasible, except when it is done as an income generating activity, such as the proposed nursery and some of the proposed vegetable production schemes (no market).
A community health center is clearly not within the project mandate. Latrines could be within the mandate, as long as it would only be training, however communities wanted latrines to be installed in every household.
It should be pointed out, that in fact more of the proposed activities could not be implemented in 1996 than suggested by Table 4. Several activities took more than one year to complete - especially gully control works-, while others were rescheduled during a series of Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning workshops organized between October and December 1996.
Clearly, there was a major gap between activities identified in the CAPs, and those still within the workplan after feasibility analysis and other screening methods were applied. Thus, there is scope for improvement of the CAP planning process.
2.3.5 Design of small scale engineering works
First of all, it should be understood, that in the context of rural Nepal, one has to be careful before making a formal design of a small scale engineering work, because whichever office or institute makes the design is expected to also take care of its implementation. Therefore, it is wise to only make designs of those works which one can actually also implement. This is the reason that the project limited its design activities to those that it would subsequently support for implementation. Several other feasible activities were said to be "taken over" by other line agencies, notably the District Development Council and the District Water Supply Office, as well as one of the Village Development Committees. These activities are not further dealt with in this or the subsequent paragraph, but will be included in the lists of "implemented activities" in paragraph 2.3.7.
Gully control and landslide treatment consists of gabion checkdams and/or dry stone walls, accompanied by biological conservation measures. Trail improvement consists of enlargement and paving with stone slabs of steep footpaths. Water source protection includes capturing of a source and construction of a water holding tank, laying of water pipes and installation of one or more water taps per source. Small scale hill irrigation consists of the tapping of water from small streams, and guiding through narrow channels or pipes to cropland.
A major effort has gone in the design of the feasible small scale engineering works. These designs include detailed estimates in volume and quantity of different works, such as stone quarrying, sand transport, trench digging, masonry, preparation of gabion boxes, and so on. Unit rates are used to determine costs and/or labour time to prepare each particular detail. Standard rates are used for volumes of work per labour day. District rates are used to calculate cost of skilled and un-skilled labour. Market prices are used to estimate the cost of outside materials.
Thus a first step is the design and calculation of actual costs of proposed activities. This implies a lot of field work and involves direct beneficiaries in the tracing of channels, trails, and the like. Secondly and based on the detailed estimates as well as the criteria for cost sharing, calculations are made to determine project costs and user group contribution.
These designs and calculations are made by the concerned area facilitator, assisted -if necessary- by another mid-level technician with particular expertise. Subsequently these designs and cost estimates are presented to the Assistant Soil Conservation Officer for verification. Once satisfied the ASCO recommends the activity to the District Soil Conservation Officer and the Chief Technical Advisor for implementation. A final screening is done to compare proposed activities with available budgets.
It is important to note that sometimes during implementation the need/desire arises to change the design. Though these changes are often minor (e.g. size of cement slab in front of a water tap), they are sometimes major, in particular in the case of gully control works. Therefore a certain flexibility is always required.
2.3.6 Implementation costs and agreements
Of the proposed activities that passed the participatory feasibility analysis and other screening methods, the small scale engineering works were by far the most expensive - at least for the project (see also para 2.3.3 on cost sharing and people's contribution). Conservation plantations can also be costly, depending on their size, but no agreement could be reached on implementation conditions of any of these, thus they were not included in the project workplans for 1996 and 1997.
The estimated implementation costs (excluding project staff and operational costs) of the small scale engineering works included in the 1996 CAPs and retained in the 1996 and/or 1997 project workplans was NRs 2,267,669, equivalent to appr. US$ 40,000 (Table 5)^3. Of this sum NRs 1,339,467 (59%) was budgeted as project contribution, of which NRs 968,751 (43%) for-outside-material, and NRs 370,716 (1 6%) for skilled and un-skilled labour. Total people's contribution was estimated at NRs 928,202 (41 %), all in the form of un-skilled labour and local materials (also requiring un-skilled labour).
^3 The official exchange rate during this period has been remarkably stable at NRs 56.75 for US$ 1.00.
It should be noted that these were not the only small scale engineering works included in the projects' 1996 and 1997 workplans. A number of previously started works had not been completed in 1995 and could only be finished in 1996 or even 1997. New works were also added in the series of Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning workshops that were conducted between October and December 1996. Furthermore, a few works were added to cope with unforeseen situations (i.e. to assist communities in certain sensitive areas, otherwise not fulfilling the criteria for implementation).
It should also be noted that actual implementation costs are slightly different from estimated costs, reflecting fluctuations in prices, cost of transport to remote sites, and amendments in design.
Four gully control works were budgeted, for a total of NRs 625,252 (appr. US$ 11,000), or NRs 156,313 per treated gully. Nrs 391,408 (63%) would be contributed by the project as material (NRs 288,455 or 46%), and labour (NRs 102,973 or 16%). Estimated people's contribution was NRs 233,845 or 37%, ranging from 24% to 41 % of total costs. The gully control work in Ghimiregaon constitutes the largest field activity carried out during the project, with a total value of NRs 471,595 (appr. US$ 8,300).

Total engineering activities
Reference is made to the communities in which the activity was proposed, sometimes activities have been implemented by active user group from neighbouring communities (e.g. trail improvement).
Six trail improvement works were budgeted, for a total of NRs 307,762 (appr. US$ 5,400), or NRs 51,294 per trail, and entirely consisting of skilled and un-skilled labour. Project contribution was estimated at NRs 168,106 (55%), and people's contribution at NRs 168,106 (45%), ranging from 45% to 50% of total costs.
Twenty-nine water source protection works were budgeted, for a total value of NRs 789,157 (appr. US$ 13,900), or NRs 27,212 per source. NRs 479,534 (61%) would be contributed by the project, consisting of material, NRs 421,844 (53%) and skilled labour, NRs 57,690 (NRs 7%). Estimated user group contribution was NRs 309,623 (39%), ranging from 25% to 52% of total costs.
Five small scale hill irrigation works were budgeted, for a total of NRs 545,487 (appr. US$ 9,600), or NRs 109,097 per irrigation scheme. NRs 300,399 (55%) would be contributed by the project, consisting of material, NRs 258,452 (47%), and skilled labour, NRs 41,947 (8%). Estimated people's contribution was NRs 245,088 (45%), ranging from 43% to 47% of total costs.
Once design and budget of proposed small scale engineering works (and conservation plantations) have been cleared and approved by all parties concerned, an agreement is signed by the implementing user group, the concerned area facilitator and the District Soil Conservation Officer.
Implementation agreements with user groups
These agreements indicate the site and activity, implementing user group, and approximate start and completion date of the activity. They also provide an outline of the material and skilled (and in some cases un-skilled) labour to be paid for by the project, and the un-skilled labour and local materials to be provided by the user group. The detailed design estimates are attached in annex to the agreements. The agreements also stipulate conditions for payment, and indicates that user groups are not allowed to use material for any other purposes. Similarly, the user groups are obliged to carry out the work themselves, without making use of subcontracted un-skilled labour.
2.3.7 Physical activities implemented
Signing an agreement for the implementation of a specific activity or small scale engineering work with a user group does not necessarily mean that the activity will be effectively implemented. For many user groups the agreements remain "a piece of paper", with more importance being given to the amounts of money or supplies to be provided than on the actual timing (by the user groups) of implementation. Thus, there are many examples of delayed implementation, and in some cases cancellation because of too long delays.
A total of 74 physical activities included in the 1996 CAPs was implemented in 1996 and the first half of 1997, most with assistance from the project, some by other institutions (Table 6). Thus out of an original total of 177 activities, 96 appeared feasible, and 74 (42% of the original total, 77% of the feasible total) were completed within a year and a half.

In Ampipal VDC, only 5 out of 13 originally planned activities (38%) were completed. In Chhoprak VDC, 44 out of 107 (41%) were completed, but in the concentration area. Wards # 7, 8 and 9, 35 out of 66 (53%) were realized. In Harmi VDC, 6 out of 19 (32%) were completed, and in Khoplang VDC, 19 out of 40 (48%).
It is important to note that certain activities were implemented in communities that had not originally included these in their CAPs. An example is Firfire, which did not include grass-, fodder-, fruit- and vegetable- planting in their CAP, but who participated in all of these. Similarly, improved breeding bucks (goats) were provided, but none of the communities that had originally indicated its interest in this activity was prepared to actually buy such a buck. Other communities who had not originally indicated their interest did purchase such a buck with the assistance of the project.
Political disturbances negatively affected implementation of planned activities in parts of the watershed.

2.4.1 Training activities included in the CAPs
2.4.2 Selection and organization of training activities
2.4.3 Training activities implemented
2.4.1 Training activities included in the CAPs
A wide range of training subjects were suggested by the communities for inclusion in the CAPs (the range of subjects could have been much shorter if there would have been no open ended participatory planning mechanism, but rather a menu of choices). These different requests were regrouped into 15 categories, including a livestock "cluster" and an agriculture "cluster" (see Table 7).
A total of 46 different training activities were included in the 26 CAPs, ranging from training in forest management (3×), livestock (husbandry and/or health, 7×), agriculture (general, fodder, fruit, vegetable, compost, nursery, 16×), improved stoves (7×), group formation (1×), adult literacy (especially of women, 5×), public health (1×), sewing and knitting (2×), and study tours (4×)(see Table 7).
On average, 1.8 training activities were selected per community. However, 8 communities did not select any training activity. It would seem that in some communities training was not considered, such as in Firfire (Chhoprak #8) and Kolkate (Khoplang #4), while in other communities it was very specifically included, e.g. in Katubanse (Chhoprak #9) and Khurpajung (Khoplang #4). In general, the communities of the project concentration area (Chhoprak Wards #7, 8 and 9), seemed more aware of training possibilities, with on average 3.1 such activities in their CAPs. The 19 communities outside the concentration area included on average only 1.3 training activities in their CAPs.

Training was often not included as main activity, but as supporting activity. For instance a CAP may include fruit tree planting as main activity, and subsequently under inputs from other institutions is included "District Agriculture Office should provide technical support and training". Therefore, inclusion of training is often the result of a more detailed activity planning, while the absence of training as specific activity does not mean that those communities would not be interested in such training activities.
2.4.2 Selection and organization of training activities
Selection of training activities
Too many different subject matters had been included in the CAPs, and it was clear that the project would have to select the most relevant and/or most requested subjects. Those subject matters that had little to do with the project mandate were the first to be excluded from the training program, notably public health and sewing and knitting training. It was decided not to reject the request for adult literacy classes, especially those targeted at women groups, because literacy skills are perceived as essential to build sustainable and active user groups.
The nursery techniques training was rejected because the project had previously (in 1993) organized such a training, without much enduring effects, and because the related nursery establishment (physical) activity was found to be not feasible.
Livestock "husbandry" and "general" agriculture training were rejected because these subject matters were either too vague, or too wide to be fitted in relatively short duration training events.
Training requires competent trainers and resource persons. Whenever such resource persons could not be found locally at modest costs (e.g. other line agencies and local NGOs), the project was inclined to reject the proposed training. This was for instance the case for improved stoves training, for which only expensive (national) NGOs could be identified.
In the case of livestock health training, which was also rejected, the question of follow-up, i.e. equipping local animal heath workers and stores, seemed essential for the training to be meaningful, and too much for the project to handle.
Thus, out of the proposed 46 training subject, 13 (28%) were rejected by the project.
Organization of training activities
All these training activities had been proposed by user groups and/or communities, and they were primarily interested in training events in their own village, in which a substantial group of local farmers would be able to participate, rather than training in a more central location with only one or two participants per community.
This meant that the whole organization of training activities had to be adjusted to fit these desires.
Thus, trainers and resource persons had to go from village to village to conduct training events, which implied detailed planning and field verification beforehand. This, for instance, to check whether the communities were genuinely interested in the proposed training events that they had included in their CAPs, and whether there were maybe additional user groups that would also be interested in such training, but had not reflected this in their CAPs.
It was also necessary to verify whether the proposed training was actually valid in every location. In case of vegetable production training (as a start of income generating activities), some of the proposing community seemed too far away from any market, and the training was partially rejected.
At the village level, farmers, especially women, are usually very busy, and can not spend much time in training (or PRA) events. So training plans needed to be adopted to such a situation, preferably with several half-day or evening sessions^4.
^4 When training is centrally organized (i. e. in the office or in base-camp), and only representatives of communities participate, longer training sessions can be held.
After completion of the PRA and Planning exercises, in January 1996, and before the onset of the rainy season, in June 1996, priority had to be given to the implementation of physical activities. Training events were scheduled largely to take place after the rainy season, from September 1996 onwards.
2.4.3 Training activities implemented
A total of 15 proposed training events that had been included in the 1996 CAPs were implemented by the project in 1996 and the first half of 1997 (Table 8). Thus, out of an original total of 46 proposed training activities, 13 were rejected, and only 33% were actually implemented, though of the 33 "accepted" training events 45% were realized.
A two-day Forest management workshop was organized, with the assistance of the District Forest Office, from 14-15 November 1997 in Chhorkate Base Camp, with 29 representatives (including 4 women) of 7 Forest User Groups. Thus, where 3 communities had requested such training, 7 actually participated in the workshop.
Ten one-day Compost making workshops were organized in 10 different locations in the period of 4-13 August 1997, with 117 farmers (including 61 women) of 10 different user groups. Thus, where 3 communities had requested such training, 10 actually participated in the workshops.

Five two-day Vegetable production training workshops were organized in 5 different locations in the period of 8-17 December 1996, with 129 farmers (including 108 women) of 8 different user groups (of 7 different communities). Thus, where 3 communities had requested vegetable production training, 7 communities actually participated in the training, though this included only 2 of the requesting communities.
Sixteen two-day Self-reliance training workshops (i.e. group formation and strengthening) were organized in 16 different locations, in which 302 farmers (including 150 women) of 51 user groups participated. Thus, where only 1 community had specifically requested a group formation training, user groups of more than 20 communities actually participated.
Five six-months Disadvantaged groups capacity building training (i.e. adult literacy classes) were conducted, under sub-contract by a local NGO, from December 1996 to July 1997 in five locations in 4 different communities, and in which about 100-125 illiterate members of disadvantaged caste/ethnic groups (including more than 90% women) participated. Thus, where 3 communities had requested adult literacy classes, the project organized such training in 4 communities. However, these included only 2 of the requesting communities. A different NGO, under subcontract from a different donor, conducted adult literacy classes in the 3rd community that had made the original request.
One Farmers exchange visit/in-country study tour to Nuwakot was organized from 25-28 December 1996, in which 26 user group members (including 20 women) from 8 different communities of the Bhusunde Khola watershed participated. Thus, where 4 communities had requested a study tour, 8 actually participated.
Several other training events also took place that covered subject matters included in the CAPs, however, they were not the actual training requested, e.g. the Participatory livestock and agroforestry development planning workshops (January 1996); or they were targeted at different communities than those that had made the request, e.g. the Horticulture field days (October 1996 and January 1997).

2.5 Monitoring and evaluation
2.5.1 Project level monitoring
2.5.2 Project level evaluation
2.5.3 Community level monitoring
2.5.4 Community level evaluation
2.5.1 Project level monitoring
Given the high number of proposed activities included in the 26 CAPs, project level monitoring of the implementation of the CAPs was essential. This monitoring took different forms at different levels.
A Community Action Plan Data Base was developed (in Excel) by the APO/Watershed Management Officer, Ms. H. Qwist-Hoffmann, in the period February - April 1996. This database was extremely useful, because it produced an overview of the 26 CAPs, and served as an important planning tool. The database was updated several times, in order to keep track of activity feasibility, design estimates, and progress in implementation. However, it became gradually evident that there were too many changes occurring in the field, such as changes of site names, user group and community responsibilities, that eroded the reliability of the database, and increased the time needed to keep it up to date.
A Physical activity implementation data base was developed (in LOTUS) by the project's Administrative Assistant, Mr. R.S. Thapa. This database used the agreements with user groups for the implementation physical activities and enabled project management to monitor financial aspects of implementation, including the delivery of materials.
At the District Soil Conservation Office level, the Assistant Soil Conservation Officer, Mr. B.D. Dhungana, served as focal point to monitor the quality of the detailed design estimates, and subsequent implementation of activities.
Regular staff meetings were most important in monitoring the implementation of activities. It was in such meetings that systematic information was provided concerning each and every scheduled (i.e. agreed with user group) activity, problems were highlighted, adjustments agreed upon, and staff assignments made according to need.
At the field level, responsibility was assigned for all activities in a particular area to mid-level technicians, the so-called Area Facilitators. Still the amount of activities in their assigned areas was too much to handle without assistance. Two kinds of assistance were provided (i) the Field Assistants (male) monitored progress in activity implementation by the user groups and informed the Area Facilitators of the need for technical back-stopping, or the supply of additional material; (ii) the Group Promoters (female) were instrumental in contacting communities and user groups to collect their demand for fruit and forest tree seedlings, improved breeding bucks, particular training events, and so on.
The Group Promoters were also monitoring the performance of the user groups, which was particularly important because of the criteria set by the project to work only with active user groups.
2.5.2 Project level evaluation
Project level evaluation of implemented activities also took different forms. Overall project self evaluation took the form of a two-day Self-evaluation workshop, 11-12 July 1996.
Final payments to user groups, upon reported completion of activities, were not made until field verification was carried out by the Area Facilitators.
The overall quality of the work performed in a particular area, i.e. within the responsibility of a particular Area Facilitator, was jointly but informally evaluated by the District Soil Conservation Officer/National Project Director, Mr. B.K. Rimal, and the concerned staff members.
Detailed and formal evaluation of implemented physical activities was limited to the most popular activity, water source protection/drinking water supply. This evaluation was based on filled out forms, which was done by the Group Promoters.
Training activities directly organized by the project usually included a final evaluation session, in which participants could give their opinion. The adult literacy classes ended with a simple test, which only 65 of the more than 100 participants passed.
2.5.3 Community level monitoring
Communities constantly monitor and evaluate whatever is going on in their surroundings, though in an informal way. However, with regards to the physical activities there are at least four different types of more formal monitoring by user groups:
(i) The time that each user group member spends in the completion of a particular activity;
(ii) The quantity of local material provided by the user groups in the implementation of physical activities (sand, gravel, etc.);
(iii) The income generated -at the user group level- by communal vegetable production by women groups; and
(iv) The mating frequency of improved breeding bucks.
It should be noted, that the active user groups operate savings and credit schemes, which they scrupulously monitor.
2.5.4 Community level evaluation
Community level evaluation was facilitated by the project in a series of 5 Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning (PERP) Workshops in the period October -December 1996, covering 8 of the original PRA communities included in the 1995/96 PRA, notably Majhgaon (Chhoprak #7); Tutunga, Firfire and Arubothe/Mathure (Chhoprak #8); Katubanse (Chhoprak #9); and Belbas, Kolkate and Khurpajung (Khoplang #4). A total of 19 user groups were represented in these workshops.
In each workshop participating user groups typically consisted of a ward level user group, 1 or more women groups, a forest user group and a disadvantaged minority group. Participatory evaluation tools used included (see also Field Document 7/96):
(i) Impact assessment, identification and mapping of changes in the community; and
(ii) Assessment of work done, observation walks and strength, weakness and opportunity analysis.
This community level evaluation focussed on implemented activities. As far as non-accomplished activities are concerned, if they were still considered relevant, the PERP workshops were used to re-schedule their implementation in 1997. A more detailed and specific report will be produced regarding the outcomes of these PERP workshops and the related 1997 Community Action Plans.

2.6 Conclusions
2.6.1 Quality of the CAPs
2.6.2 Implementation rate
2.6.3 Participatory implementation of physical activities
2.6.4 Planning of training activities
2.6.5 Monitoring and evaluation
2.6.1 Quality of the CAPs
If judged by the implementation rates, the quality of the Community Action Plans was not as high as expected. However, it should be noted that implementation rates could have been higher if less communities would have been included in the 95/96 PRAs. The following conclusions reflect on the quality of the 1996 CAPs:
1. Several factors influenced the planning process, notably (i) Expectations of the local population; (ii) Project norms, terms and conditions for the participatory implementation of activities; and (iii) The focus on communities and user groups during the participatory planning process.
2. Physical activities usually form the core of the CAPs, and were systematically dealt with by the facilitators.
3. Training activities are haphazardly included in the CAPs, are often hidden under the physical activities, and were not systematically dealt with by the facilitators.
4. In general, the 1996 CAPs were too ambitious to be accomplished in one year, mainly because no analysis was made during planning of the actual time local community members could contribute in the implementation of the plans, and because participatory feasibility studies were carried out after the definition of the CAPs.
The combination of all CAPs, covering a majority of the population of Bhusunde Khola watershed, is the closest thing we have to a participatory watershed management plan. It has many drawbacks, such as limited time frame, poor spatial integration and little homogeneity, but it is the genuine product of a participatory planning process.
2.6.2 Implementation rate
Out of a total of 223 activities included in 26 CAPs, 89 were actually implemented in 1996 and 1997, and the overall implementation rate was 40%. For physical activities the implementation rate was 42% (74 out of 177 planned activities). For training activities the implementation rate was only 33% (15 out of 46 planned activities).
These implementation rates appear to be quite low. This is partly due to the fact that feasibility studies were only carried out after the CAPs had been defined, and partly because of the terms and conditions set by the project for implementation. Of the original 177 planned physical activities, 81 (46%) were screened out and appeared un-feasible. Of the remaining 96 feasible activities the implementation rate was 77%, which seems not bad at all.
Several other institutions were involved in the implementation of both physical and training activities included in the CAPs. Some of the water source protection works (drinking water supply) were implemented by the District Development Council and the Village Development Committees. The District Forest Office and the District Agriculture Development Office provided training services to user groups in the Bhusunde Khola watershed, upon request (and renumeration) of the project. Adult literacy classes were provided through the services of local NGOs, in one case these were funded by another donor.
2.6.3 Participatory implementation of physical activities
The people of the Bhusunde Khola watershed, in particular those organized in user groups and collaborating with the project, worked hard in the implementation of the activities they had planned themselves. Their contribution in the form of un-skilled labour without renumeration in engineering works, gully control, trail improvement, water source protection and small scale hill irrigation, included in the 1996 CAPs amounted to an estimated NRs 928,000 (equivalent to about US$ 16,352). This amounted to 41 % of the total cost of these activities.
A further contribution was made as remunerated un-skilled labour in gully control and trail improvement of an estimated NRs 260,000 (equivalent to about US$ 4,581), or 11 % of the total cost of engineering activities.
Finally, remunerated skilled labour was recruited from the population for an estimated total of NRs 110,000 (equivalent to US$ 1,938), or 5% of the total cost.
The values used for skilled and un-skilled labour were NRs 130 and NRs 65 per day respectively. The total remunerated and non-remunerated skilled and un-skilled labour contributed to implement the engineering activities amounted to about 19,000 workdays.
On top of this, a lot of time was spent on other engineering activities, not included in the 1996 CAPs, on other physical activities (planting trees, building community houses, etc.), on training, participatory feasibility analysis, and in many, many meetings.
Often activities were delayed or had to be postponed because of a lack of time of the members of the user groups that had agreed to implement these activities. There is clearly a limit to the "participatory capacity" in terms of time availability of the user groups.
2.6.4 Planning of training activities
The planning of training activities, as expressed in the CAPs, was clearly of less quality than the planning of physical activities. This was largely due to the limited instructions in this respect that the PRA facilitators had received. Often training subjects were proposed that were too vague and broad.
In fact the training program as it was implemented was only partially based on the results of the PRA and CAPs. The most relevant subject matters as indicated in the CAPs were selected for training events, and subsequently user group were asked if they would be interested to also participate in these training events.
Training was not systematically addressed during CAP planning, otherwise communities such as Firfire (Chhoprak #9), which had not included training in their CAP, would not have participated in almost every training event organized.
2.6.5 Monitoring and evaluation
There has been a lot of discussion and self-criticism in the project about the perceived lack of monitoring and evaluation systems. However, it would not have been possible to implement such a large amount of activities without a functional monitoring and evaluation mechanism.
Some attempts were made in 1995 and again in 1996 to start a monitoring and evaluation "master plan", but this did not work as such. However, at different levels, from project management to mid-level technicians, group promoters and user groups, different monitoring and evaluation practices have functioned. Information flows were sufficient to enable staff and user groups to work fairly effectively.
The fact that different monitoring and evaluation mechanisms have been in effect at different levels, in fact were developed at these different levels, made the whole project level planning and implementation system resilient. Centrally planned, more formalized and computerized monitoring, appeared to have limited use and was very sensitive and easily disturbed by continuously occurring changes at field level.
<section>9</section>
3.1. Quality of participatory planning procedures
Though the Community Action Plans were the genuine product of a participatory planning process there remains a lot of scope to improve the participatory planning procedures:
1. The participatory feasibility analysis should form an integral part of the CAP planning procedure. It is recommended that during PRA and the first community forum a draft CAP is prepared, after which each proposed activity should be subjected to a participatory feasibility analysis (PFA). The results of this PFA should than be presented and discussed again in a second community forum meeting, after which the CAP should be finalized. This planning mechanism could take place either at community, or at user group level, whichever is most convenient, as long as the PFA is done before finalizing the CAP.
2. There should always be clarity and transparency of the project's policy and implementation criteria. There are several sets of criteria in use, concerning (a) conditions user groups should fulfil to qualify for project support, (b) cost sharing conditions for the implementation of activities, and (c) criteria regarding what kind of activities the project would be willing to consider for support. It is important that communities are aware of these criteria during the planning procedures, and that these criteria remain as constant as possible.
3. Better use should be made of data on time utilization in farming systems as generated during PRA exercises. Such analysis would permit the calculation and timing of labour availability that could be used in the implementation of physical activities, or to take part in training events^5.
^5 This has already been put into practice in the Participatory Evaluation and Re-Planning Exercises In Bhusunde Khola watershed.
4. Systematic attention should be paid to the planning of training events in the participatory planning procedure.
5. Seemingly limitless variations between similar activities in different CAPs and vagueness within CAPs should be minimized by further improving the skills of the PRA and Planning facilitators, and by providing them with more detailed instructions.

3.2. Participatory implementation of CAPs
There is a clear limit to the "participatory capacity" of communities, that could be expressed in the total time over a given period that farmers (specified by gender) can contribute to meetings, training and physical activities. The total package of the 1996 CAPs contained clearly more activities than either the concerned user groups could handle. These limits are especially evident when renumeration of certain activities (e.g. un-skilled labour in gully control) could in some cases not speed up the actual implementation of activities. Similarly, it has often been observed that certain groups (i.e. women, or disadvantaged poor people) could not stay during the whole duration of meetings or training events.
One way of dealing with this time limitation problem, is to limit the number of agreements per user group to one-at-a-time. Only when a particular project supported activity is implemented and completed should an agreement be signed to start a new activity. Such restrictions should be limited to activities that actually require agreements with user groups, because these activities are the most time consuming and are usually the cause of delays.
Such restrictions (which have already been put into practice) also make it easier for the concerned staff to actually provide necessary technical back-stopping.
There is also a clear limit to what different levels of project staff that deal directly with user groups can handle. It would seem that the minimum staffing requirements are 1 Area Facilitator (mid-level technician) per VDC (9 Wards); 1 Field Assistant (male) per VDC; and 2 Group Promoters (female) per VDC.
Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of particular activities should be as much as possible decentralized to the different levels in the project hierarchy, information should be analyzed and acted upon by these different staff levels, and should only be transmitted to higher echelons on a "need to know" basis.

3.3 Facilitator skills and staff management
Time and again, it is concluded that the quality of the implementation of particular steps in the participatory development process depends on the skills of staff and facilitators. In this report, staff and facilitator skills were mentioned in particular in relation to the planning of training activities during CAP formulation. Other aspects that need further attention in the preparation and training of staff and facilitators include: (i) The better use of data on time availability in farming systems in activity planning; (ii) Improvement in the procedures and skills concerned with participatory feasibility analysis; (iii) More clear definitions of proposed activities in CAPs to reduces variations and vagueness; and (iv) Systematic attention to the planning of training activities.
One of the main requirements of a participatory development program is flexibility. This is often interpreted as flexibility towards the communities. However, it has become more and more evident that such flexibility also needs to be extended to the staff. Clearly some individuals have more technical skills and talents, while others would seem better in training, or participatory planning and negotiation techniques. Though attempts may be made to assign strict working areas (e.g. Area Facilitators), in reality the program benefits from a flexible interpretation of such divisions, emphasizing team work and mutual assistance between different staff members with different technical backgrounds and "participatory" skills.
Similarly, where conditions are set to communities and user groups, more stringent conditions could also be set to the staff, notable the Area Facilitators (mid-level technicians), in particular to secure their presence in the field when required, and to have better cooperation in maintaining monitoring and evaluation records.

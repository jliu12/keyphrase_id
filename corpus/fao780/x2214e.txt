<title>FAO Policy and Strategy for Cooperation with Non-Governmental and Civil Society Organizations</title>
<section>1</section>
Statement by the Director-General
The rapid changes taking place today in the roles of government and civil society make it imperative to take a fresh look at FAO's potential for partnerships. As underscored by the World Food Summit Plan of Action, civil society's commitment will be indispensable if the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from food insecurity is to be attained by the year 2015. Although FAO is an intergovernmental institution, it has a long history of cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We need to build on FAO's ability to relate to a broad range of constituencies, while reaffirming the primary responsibility of national governments in assuring the food security of their citizens.
The Organization's potential and need to expand its partnership activities led me to request a thorough review of FAO's cooperation with NGOs and other civil society organizations (CSOs), to be coordinated by the Unit for Cooperation with Private Sector and NGOs (TCDN) in consultation with our technical units and decentralized offices as well as external partners. The objective of the review was to formulate policy and strategy guidelines adapted to the challenges we will be facing in the coming years. The results are presented in this paper.
The issues underlying the strategy and action plan can be grouped under three queries: why should FAO seek stronger relations with civil society; who is included under this label; and how, and in what form, should the relationship be strengthened?
Why? Closer association with NGOs and other CSOs should enhance the validity and equity of decision-making under FAO auspices by ensuring consideration of the interests of all social sectors and by building consensus among stakeholders in development. Such cooperation should also attract substantive input into the Organization's normative activities and increase the effectiveness of our Field Programme by drawing on the expertise, experience and insight of NGOs and other CSOs. This will help harness additional resources for achieving common food security goals and, moreover, increase awareness of FAO's work, making the Organization better known and accountable to a wider public.
In return, I believe FAO can provide civil society with valuable technical and institutional support, help it to replicate proven NGO approaches and improve its access to information and decision-making processes.
Who? Within the heterogeneous and rapidly expanding civil society sector, we need to identify relevant organizations for different kinds of cooperation, and this paper sets a basis for doing so. FAO's limited resources require it to focus on priority partners such as membership organizations representing important constituencies, such as farmers and consumers, and technically competent intermediary NGOs that are able to commit to ongoing cooperation with FAO. Whatever the organization, partnerships must respect basic principles of congruence with FAO's mandate, shared interests and objectives, transparency and accountability.
How? The review has identified strategies and key activities in four areas: information sharing and analysis, policy dialogue, field programmes and resource mobilization. We are committed to implementing these strategies and activities in consultation with our partners. The challenge for FAO is to develop cooperation with a growing civil society sector in the present era of declining real resources. To meet this challenge, we will need to choose partners and activities strategically, promoting coordination and networks among NGOs and other CSOs so as to multiply dialogue and outreach. In addition, these organizations must have a share in the for planning and implementing programmes as well as for mobilizing resources. It is important also for FAO's country representatives to ensure that outreach includes the national organizations that are closest to rural people.
The desire to leave future generations a better world than that received in trust by the current generation has motivated many of the most generous actions performed by the human race, and it takes on added force as we move from one millenium to the next. With the publication of this policy and strategy paper, FAO aspires to a pact with civil society to work together for a better world.

Executive summary
Introduction
The importance of partnerships with non-governmental and civil society organizations was underscored by Member Governments in the World Food Summit Plan of Action and is confirmed in FAO's Strategic Framework.
At the Director-General's request, the Unit for Cooperation with the Private Sector and NGOs (TCDN) coordinated an FAO-wide review of policy and strategy for NGO/CSO cooperation in consultation with the technical departments, which undertook their own assessments, and with decentralized offices and NGOs. In the resulting paper, categories of relevant partners for different purposes are identified, based on their areas of activity and their organizational characteristics. Priority partners are membership organizations representing constituencies such as farmers and consumers, and technically competent NGOs committed to ongoing cooperation.
Strategies and priorities for action
The challenge is to develop cooperation with a rapidly expanding NGO/CSO sector in a period of declining resources. This requires a strategic choice of partners and activities; promoting networks among NGOs/CSOs to multiply outreach; sharing responsibility for programme planning and resource mobilization; and using country offices to reach the organizations closest to rural people. The paper presents a framework for closer collaboration on a long-term programme in four interrelated functional areas:
Information sharing and analysis
The strategy builds on FAO's Corporate Communication Strategy. Priority activities include:
* preparing a public information disclosure policy;
* developing joint information projects with regional and thematic NGO/CSO networks;
* creating an Internet page for NGOs within the TC Department's site;
* improving information dissemination capacity through FAO country offices.
Policy dialogue
The strategy is based on FAO's ability to facilitate government-civil society dialogue and on the increased technical competence of many NGOs/CSOs. Priority activities include:
* at the national level, promoting NGO/CSO participation in policy and programming negotiations with governments and other actors, including through Thematic Groups of the ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security;
* at the regional level, encouraging the formation of regional networks and their input into regional conferences and technical commissions;
* at the global level, encouraging issue-based NGO/CSO groups and their participation in FAO technical committees; establishing an FAO-NGO/CSO consultative task force with representatives of the thematic and regional networks working with FAO.
Field programmes
The strategy is based on promoting NGO/CSO cooperation from the planning stage of country programme frameworks and building partnerships based on shared objectives, resources and clear responsibilities for all parties. Priority activities include:
* developing pilot projects with NGOs/CSOs and diffusing successful experiences;
* reviewing operational procedures to remove constraints to NGO/CSO cooperation;
* strengthening the capacity of farmers' organizations/NGOs to provide services to small producers;
* enhancing participation in key FAO programmes (e.g. the Special Programme for Food Security and response to emergencies).
Resource mobilization
With an increasing share of official development assistance (ODA) channelled through NGOs, the strategy seeks to promote synergies and help NGOs apply their resources effectively. Priority activities include:
* promoting cooperation with bilateral NGO programmes in which FAO is funded to provide technical assistance;
* taking advantage of new possibilities for the funding of CSO partnership activities by UN system and bilateral donors;
* using TCP funds (with government endorsement), together with matching NGO funds, to provide technical assistance to NGOs/CSOs;
* cofunding TeleFood projects.
Managing NGO/CSO cooperation in FAO
Implementing this strategy will require an Organization-wide commitment and specific management measures, including:
* revising formal status and meeting attendance procedures;
* integrating partnerships into FAO's programme planning process;
* promoting a "partnership culture" within FAO;
* strengthening the capacity of decentralized offices to build relations with civil society by designating a focal point, seeking additional human resources and mobilizing financial resources for partnership activities from local donor offices;
* formalizing an NGO working group in FAO to implement this strategy in collaboration with TCDN.
Technical issues
Technical departments have identified the following as some of the areas where NGO/CSO involvement is particularly critical and where there is scope for enhanced partnership:
* Access to land and natural resources
* Agricultural trade liberalization
* Biodiversity
* Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
* Genetic resources for food and agriculture
* Integrated pest management
* Organic agriculture

1. Introduction
1.1 The context
The member countries of FAO, in approving the Organization's Constitution, defined its ultimate purpose in the following terms:
"raising the levels of nutrition and standards of living of the peoples under their respective jurisdictions; securing improvements in the efficiency of the production and distribution of all food and agricultural products; bettering the condition of rural populations; and thus contributing toward an expanding world economy and ensuring humanity's freedom from hunger".
FAO was one of the first UN agencies to recognize that fulfilment of this purpose would require the involvement of society at large. The Freedom from Hunger Campaign (FFHC) was established in 1959 as a means to this end.^1 Over time, technical units and offices throughout FAO have built up their relations with NGOs, both in the field and through global dialogue and information sharing. These efforts have given very positive results, but more could be achieved with a guiding policy, appropriate operational procedures and effective mechanisms for exchanging, and learning from, experience.
The rapid transformations taking place in the world today make it imperative to take a fresh look at FAO's relations with NGOs and other non-state actors. This is a challenge that the UN system as a whole is facing.^2 Over the past decade, the globalization of the economy has affected governments' control of a range of policy instruments. Structural adjustment reforms have led to the transfer of more responsibility for services and economic initiative to the private sector and civil society. At the same time, the demise of authoritarian regimes has created an opportunity for groups and movements of all kinds to spring up and make their voices heard.
However the changing roles of government and civil society are defined, it is clear that there are many more actors impacting on food security and agricultural development (including fisheries and forestry) than in the past. Until recently, despite its history of relations with NGOs, as an intergovernmental institution FAO interacted predominantly with government services in performing its functions of providing technical assistance and policy advice and setting norms. Now it needs to relate to a broader range of constituencies. In the World Food Summit Plan of Action, FAO's Member Governments underscored the importance of alliances with CSOs, paying tribute to the effectiveness of their contribution to national and global food security.
It was this concern that led the Director-General of FAO, in 1996, to request the Unit for Cooperation with Private Sector and NGOs (TCDN) to coordinate a review of FAO's policy and strategy of cooperation with NGOs. The review has been carried out in close consultation with NGOs from all regions, whose views and expectations have been synthesized in a paper prepared by an NGO spokesperson.^3 An Expert Meeting on Civil Society Involvement in Follow-up to the World Food Summit,^4 held at the request of the Director-General in January 1998, provided further insights. Within FAO, a network of NGO focal points has been established to share experience and stimulate reflection. Input has been sought from field offices. Each technical department has undertaken its own review of its cooperation with NGOs, flagging policy issues that require attention at the Organization-wide level and identifying priorities and opportunities for working with NGOs in the technical areas of concern to
them.
The main findings of these separate exercises have been brought together in this policy and strategy paper, which has been subscribed to by the various units and offices of FAO and by the Organization's senior management. The strategies and priorities for action set out in sections II and III below constitute a long-term programme to be carried out as resources permit. It will be discussed with CSOs in order to agree on a work plan and define responsibilities for resource mobilization and implementation.
This paper addresses a set of needs and opportunities as they are currently perceived. As the relationship between FAO and CSOs evolves, so will the policy framework and work programme.
1.2 A basis for partnership FAO today
Certain aspects of FAO's work and institutional identity have made it an increasingly significant UN system partner for NGOs over the years, and its mandate covers areas of vital concern to people throughout the world. It has, for example, a role in international regulation and in policy advice at the national level; and an ability to help build bridges between development and environmental concerns. As NGOs have deepened their appreciation of and their expertise in the technical content of goals such as sustainability and equity, their interest in FAO has increased.
Other aspects, however, have tended to frustrate this growing interest. NGOs feel that FAO's complexity and the procedures governing its relations with NGOs have created institutional obstacles to closer cooperation. They have found it hard to relate the top-down "macro" approaches that have been adopted by official development agencies in general to the day-to-day realities of rural people. Until recently, NGO experience in areas such as organic agriculture, in which they have taken the lead, have met with a reaction of diffidence from many technical specialists.
Since taking office in 1994, the Director-General has acted to streamline and reorganize FAO, and the measures taken are creating a more positive environment for cooperation with external partners. The Organization's focus has been sharpened by giving top priority to food security. Restructuring is bringing project operations and technical and policy advice closer to member countries by moving FAO technicians to regional and newly created subregional offices. FAO is greatly expanding its use of information technology to improve communications both within and outside the Organization.
The Strategic Framework for FAO, currently being formulated, will provide an even clearer vision of priorities and objectives. It will ensure a greater critical mass in areas where FAO has a clear comparative advantage and facilitate interdisciplinary programmes and integration of headquarters' and decentralized offices' activities. The strategic planning exercise is confirming the importance of developing partnerships across the range of the Organization's work.
The NGO/CSO sector
The UN system's definition of NGOs is broad: all not-for-profit actors who are not governmental or intergovernmental. The expansion and diversification of this sector and of its relations with the UN, however, is being accompanied by an evolution in terminology. "NGO" now tends to be reserved for formally constituted organizations, which often do not represent sectors of the population but provide services and/or mobilize public opinion in areas of relevance to the UN system. The term "civil society" refers to the sphere in which citizens and social movements organize themselves around objectives, constituencies and thematic interests. "Civil society organizations" include both NGOs and popular organizations - formal and informal - as well as other categories such as the mass media, local authorities, business leaders and the research community. The term "non-state actors" is even more comprehensive, also including for-profit businesses.
Whichever term is adopted, it is important to take account of the differences between its constituent components and the separate identities, roles and interests being pursued, and to build appropriate relations accordingly. This requires making certain common sense distinctions, for example between:
* membership organizations and others that do not represent communities or sectors of society;
* the non-profit sector and the private sector, making allowances for grey areas between the two such as informal economic enterprises of the poor;
* interests that are well structured and powerful, with easy access to national and international policy forums and others - such as small producers in the South - that do not have this access.
This paper deals with CSOs in the broad sense defined above but also maintains the reference to NGOs, since the bulk of FAO's past and present experience is with this category. FAO's cooperation with the for-profit private sector, not covered in this paper, is being developed in a parallel and complementary process. The new directions of collaboration that are emerging are often quite similar to those with CSOs and are based on the same principles of partnership.
Different categories of NGOs or CSOs are relevant partners of FAO for different purposes. Distinctions can be based on technical areas of interest (e.g. sustainable agriculture, gender, environment), functional areas of activity (e.g. capacity building, advocacy, technical support), and/or organizational characteristics (e.g. representative or non-representative, international or local, rural or urban).
FAO needs to focus its limited resources in relation to its mandate and comparative advantages as a specialized technical agency. Two clear priority categories are: technically competent service NGOs that are motivated and able to build a long-term relationship with FAO in key areas of mutual concern, and membership organizations that represent important FAO constituencies, such as farmers and consumers.
Major categories of CSOs
to which FAO relates
Rural and urban people's organizations. These membership organizations include farmers' associations, cooperatives, women's groups, credit unions, consumers' organizations, etc. Improving their members' welfare is one of FAO's basic objectives, and encouraging their participation in field action and policy dialogue is a means to this end.
Southern national and regional development NGOs. These organizations can provide services to rural people, help articulate their interests and build up their organizational strength.
Northern development NGOs. Northern NGOs that are operational in developing countries can be significant partners for FAO, while non-operational Northern development NGOs are an important source of support for their NGO partners in the South and undertake valuable development education work at home.
Humanitarian NGOs. These organizations are FAO's main implementing partners in emergency interventions.
Advocacy NGOs. Throughout the world, these NGOs can be allies of FAO in campaigning for food security objectives.
International NGOs and NGO networks. These organizations and networks have an extremely important role in the diffusion of information, exchange of experience and in the discussion and harmonization of NGO/CSO views.
Professional associations and academic/research institutions. This category provides FAO with important technical support.
Agricultural trade unions. These associations are longstanding partners of FAO at different levels.
Private sector associations. Associations linked to agriculture and food, fisheries and forestry are an increasingly important interlocutor for FAO. They range from national chambers of commerce or associations representing small producers to international associations of agro-industry companies.
Benefits of and constraints to cooperation
FAO believes strengthened cooperation with NGOs/CSOs will:
* enhance the validity and equity of policy- and decision-making conducted under FAO auspices, ensuring that it takes into consideration the interests of all sectors of society and has their support;
* obtain substantive input into the normative activities of the Organization;
* increase the effectiveness of FAO's Field Programme by drawing on the experience of NGOs/CSOs in areas such as participatory approaches, poverty alleviation measures and sustainable agriculture, as well as on their capacity to act quickly and flexibly and on their ability to target vulnerable groups;
* build public support and political will to attain food security objectives;
* make FAO's work more transparent and better known to a wider public;
* harness additional resources by matching complementarities.
NGOs have listed the following benefits^5 to be derived from cooperation with FAO:
* providing civil society actors with technical and institutional support;
* helping to replicate proven NGO approaches;
* improving the access of civil society to information;
* improving the access of civil society to government officials and decision-makers;
* by these efforts, contributing to improved mobilization of resources for food security.
Three constraints to enhanced FAO cooperation with NGOs/CSOs were identified in this review: FAO's nature as an intergovernmental organization, the level of available resources and the vast and heterogeneous nature of the NGO/CSO sector.
FAO's identity as an intergovernmental organization affects its partnerships with non-state actors. FAO's activities - particularly at the national level - must have the endorsement of concerned governments, which have differing views about appropriate forms of NGO/CSO participation. At the same time, FAO's institutional identity can be an advantage, since one reason why NGOs/CSOs seek to interact with the Organization is to facilitate their dialogue with governments and intergovernmental forums. Government participation in FAO's partnerships with civil society is part of this process.
Limited financial and human resources are a constraint throughout FAO, particularly at the country level, where small country offices are called on to perform a host of duties. Resource limitations are a reality and will affect the pace of increased collaboration. However, FAO views partnership building, not as an additional task competing with others for scarce time and funds, but as a way of improving FAO's effectiveness.
Finally, many FAO offices have cited the difficulties they experience in relating to the complex, fragmented and rapidly expanding world of NGOs/CSOs. The importance of selecting valid partners for cooperative efforts must not be underestimated. Choosing partners, however, is not an abstract exercise. It involves concrete initiatives for which the competence and relevance of specific organizations can be evaluated. The experience of country offices and technical programmes with a strong tradition of NGO relations demonstrates that, once working relations are established with NGOs/CSOs, mutual understanding is built up and the development of partnerships becomes a joint responsibility.
Principles of partnership
The principles underlying FAO's partnerships with NGOs/CSOs apply to all external actors with which the Organization enters into cooperation. Section III of this paper, Managing NGO cooperation in FAO, suggests that it may be opportune to develop a jointly subscribed code of relations, which could include the following principles drawn from the ethical and operational criteria applied by FAO in granting official NGO status:
* Congruence with FAO's mandate. Partnership activities must be consistent with FAO's mandate and enhance the effectiveness of its work. FAO will not enter into partnership with organizations whose programmes are judged to be antithetical to the Organization's mandate.
* Mutual interests and objectives. Partnership activities will focus on areas and on subjects of mutual interest to FAO and NGOs/CSOs.
* Transparency. Partnership activities will be fully transparent and information on them will be made publicly available.
* Accountability. Partnership activities will be designed and implemented in a manner that ensures clear and agreed responsibilities and accountability by all partners.
The World Food Summit
and CSOs
The World Food Summit was convened in Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996. Its objective was to renew global commitment at the highest political level to the achievement of sustainable food security. The adoption of the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action provides a framework for bringing about important changes in policies and programmes needed to achieve food for all.
Civil society's participation was prominent during the preparatory process. NGOs contributed their insights to Summit documents, regional and global consultations and meetings of the Committee on World Food Security. Some 500 national and international CSOs attended the Summit, while an NGO Forum held in parallel included 1 300 representatives from 80 countries. These consultations stimulated the creation of regional and global networks on food security that are now active in Summit follow-up.
The Plan of Action recognizes the indispensable role of civil society in achieving food security. Commitment Seven stresses that the focus of action lies at the country level, where governments have the main responsibility - involving all actors - to create an enabling economic and political environment. Governments are called on to launch national Food for All Campaigns, marshalling all sectors of civil society and their resources to help identify and implement priority measures. The first stage of these campaigns is for countries to set up national committees comprising government representatives, farmers' and consumers' organizations, NGOs, the private sector, universities, research institutes, parliamentarians, women, youth, the media and other groups who can help address food security issues and mobilize public opinion and resources.
The ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security brings together UN, governmental and non-governmental organizations to: mobilize support for efforts to implement the World Food Summit Plan of Action and rural development and food security programmes; coordinate relevant activities at the country level; and exchange information, experiences and best practices. It comprises country-level Thematic Groups involving UN organizations, donors, government institutions and CSOs and, at the global level, interested UN agencies and CSOs. Established by the UN Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC), the network is managed by FAO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in close cooperation with the World Food Programme (WFP).
1 Renewed impetus for a people-centred component in FAO's work has come from events such as the World Food Conference (1974), the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (1979), the International Conference on Nutrition (1992), World Food Day and, most recently, the World Food Summit (1996).

2. Strategies and priorities for action
This section discusses functional areas in which FAO and NGOs/CSOs would benefit from more effective cooperation. Although it is convenient to divide the presentation into four sections, the close interrelationships among them must be emphasized. Involving civil society in the mobilization of public awareness and resources is dependent on taking its input seriously in policy dialogue and on building partnerships in field programmes.
The priorities presented here constitute the basis for a long-term programme. Clearly, it will not be possible to implement them all simultaneously. Developing cooperation with a rapidly expanding civil society sector in an era of declining real resources represents a significant challenge for FAO. It will require selectivity in choosing partners and activities, and a joint effort to set priorities and mobilize the necessary resources. In this paper, FAO has taken on board many suggestions by NGOs/CSOs. These now need to be matched with the commitments that NGOs/CSOs are ready and able to make. The process of consultation will continue to this end.
2.1 Information sharing and analysis
Building better communication is not only an area of work in its own right but also a prerequisite for other forms of cooperation.
NGOs play a leading role in information and education programmes sensitizing public opinion to the challenges expressed in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action. Their experience and outreach in this area is unequalled, while FAO has a comparative advantage in its unique stock of technical data and analyses and its global overview of food security issues. Yet communication has not been FAO's strongest point, and the Organization has lacked a clear public information disclosure policy. On the other hand, the NGO world is also difficult to access from a communication point of view because it is highly fragmented and heterogeneous in its information needs and capacities.
Part of FAO's communication problem has stemmed from its technical compartmentalization. The restructuring of FAO, which started in 1994, is intended to promote an interdisciplinary approach within FAO, and the current strategic review should further improve FAO's capacity in this regard. World Food Day campaigns are one means of promoting a holistic view of world food security, since they raise public awareness of specific aspects of the problem in relation to the overall socio-economic context. The network of FAO departmental NGO focal points established for this review is also helping to create a more comprehensive capacity for communication with NGOs.
Other developments can improve the two-way exchange. The growth of electronic communication allows a richer variety of information to be made available to the public. FAO is developing a broader e-mail network and a more user-friendly Internet site. However, many NGOs/CSOs lack the necessary resources to tap electronic communication, and the distribution of printed documents will have to be maintained.
Equally promising is the increasing tendency of NGOs/CSOs to form networks and coalitions on thematic and geographic bases. FAO encourages such groupings and will work with them to enhance the dissemination of information. Excellent work has already been done through NGO cooperation with FAO in packaging technical information in language that is accessible to non-experts.
While improving information sharing with CSOs is the responsibility of FAO as a whole, the Information Division plays a central role. Its new Corporate Communication Policy and Strategy specifically identifies NGOs both as partners and as a key audience. Field and liaison offices are particularly important communication nodes, since NGOs in different regions have different information needs and capacities.
To improve information sharing and analysis, FAO will:
i) Develop an information disclosure policy
* A review of other UN agencies' policies on the public disclosure of information will be undertaken, with particular attention to field programmes, and an FAO policy paper will be drafted for submission to its governing bodies.
ii) Promote information initiatives with NGOs
* Alliances with regional and issue-based NGO/CSO networks. Issue-oriented round-table meetings will be organized with NGO information officers. Selected NGO networks will be involved in specific information-sharing projects and campaigns, including the Food for All Campaign, World Food Day and TeleFood. Publications and sales policies will be reviewed to enhance copublication and distribution through NGO networks.
* Joint publications and studies. Ad hoc FAO/NGO editorial committees will be set up to copublish thematic issues of the FAO periodical DEEP. FAO staff will be encouraged to contribute articles to NGO publications, and vice versa; NGO work will be covered in FAO publications and public information missions.
iii) Make FAO information more easily accessible and usable
* An Internet page for NGOs will be created within the TC Department's site, with links to other departmental sites. The NGO page will also be issued as a printed newsletter. Contents could include a list of projects; information on key international intergovernmental issues that are being discussed in FAO-related forums; and information regarding national Food for All Campaigns and other promotional activities within the framework of World Food Day and TeleFood.
* A brochure, targeted at CSOs and including an annotated organigram of FAO, will be published to promote their cooperation with FAO.
* Graphics and audiovisuals that translate statistics and analyses into more easily accessible terms will be diffused.
* The Fao publications catalogue will be made available to NGO/CSOs in print as well as electronic form.
* Mailing lists of periodicals will be reviewed to ensure that relevant CSOs are included.
* UN system information channels such as the UN Non-Governmental Liaison Service's bulletin, Go Between, will be used systematically to reach NGOs.
iv) Make special efforts to reach national/local organizations
* FAO Country Representations will be supplied with the necessary documentation to respond to requests for information from CSOs; the potential value and the cost of extending e-mail links to national CSOs with which FAO is cooperating will be explored.
* Regional Information Officers will be given guidance regarding outreach to CSOs.
* FAO Depository Libraries will be publicized and provided with FAO materials of interest to CSOs.
2.2 Policy dialogue
If NGOs view FAO as a significant UN system partner, it is due in good part to the Organization's role as a policy adviser to Member Governments, a forum for international negotiation and a source of support for developing countries as they negotiate in arenas such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). NGOs welcome the opportunity to contribute to the formulation of the technical policies that FAO applies in its normative work and in technical assistance and policy advice. Effective cooperation of this kind has taken place through the organization of NGO consultations feeding into FAO technical committee sessions, and the participation of NGOs as observers in processes such as the negotiation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources.
Policy dialogue in FAO involves complex interaction. It moves from the national level through the regional to the international and back again. It is composed of diverse technical topics, each contributing to broader concepts such as food security and sustainable agriculture. Articulating effective and equitable civil society participation in this process is a challenge. It is further complicated by the fact that the institutional framework and procedures of the UN system do not readily lend themselves to participation by non-state actors; by the wide variety of often conflicting views and interests represented within civil society; by the disparities in legitimacy among the various CSOs and social movements; and by the difficulties inherent in ensuring equitable access in the face of significant differences in resources and power.
Action to be taken by FAO to enhance civil society participation in policy dialogue is summarized below. The NGO community can make an equally important contribution by strengthening and extending their communications, networking and caucusing and by mobilizing resources to facilitate Southern CSOs' participation in regional and global policy forums.
FAO will, with government endorsement, promote NGO/CSO involvement in the following activities at the national, regional and global levels:
i) National
* Dialogue with government and other actors. Appropriate forums for issue-oriented NGO networking and dialogue include the national Food for All Campaigns; the ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security; and national Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) committees.
* Sectoral policy analysis and programming, including UN system planning initiatives and the formulation of national action plans in follow-up to international conferences.
* Decentralized decision-making by local authorities.
ii) Regional
* FAO-NGO/CSO consultative processes. Regional NGO/CSO networking will be promoted. CSOs will be encouraged to organize preparatory consultations to feed into the biannual FAO Regional Conferences and their participation will be sought in regional interagency task forces.
* Dialogue between regional intergovernmental organizations and NGO/CSO networks related to agricultural development and food security will be promoted, together with their participation as observers in regional technical commissions.
iii) Global
* NGO thematic groups that interact with FAO on an ongoing basis will be encouraged and their formation in other technical areas of common concern will be promoted by establishing FAO-NGO/CSO working groups on key issues such as agricultural trade and food security and sustainable agriculture.
* NGO input into FAO technical committees and other policy forums will be enhanced, starting with the Committee on World Food Security.
* An FAO-NGO/CSO task force, formed by representatives of thematic and regional networks with which FAO cooperates, will be established to serve as a reference point for FAO's relations with NGOs/CSOs. Its first task could be to review successes and deficits in existing consultation and to work with FAO to implement the outcome of this review.
* NGO/CSO experts will be considered as participants in expert committees and oversight panels.
2.3 Field Programme
FAO's Field Programme today places greater emphasis on building cooperation among all relevant actors. The primary focus is on achieving food security and development objectives rather than on strengthening cooperation per se. Since all agents are not equally well placed to play an active role, however, it is justifiable for FAO to give NGOs/CSOs special attention when they can help achieve these objectives. This can involve including them in planning and implementing field activities, working with Member Governments to facilitate their participation, and responding to their technical assistance and training needs.
Farmers'/rural peoples' organizations are prime civil society partners for FAO, as they are broadening the scale of their services to individual farmers and participating in policy and planning discussions. National NGOs providing services to rural people also require capacity building, particularly when they move from relief to development work. Programmes of this kind are becoming an area of growth in donor portfolios and it should be possible to mobilize resources for FAO activities of this kind.
A distinction needs to be made between seeking partnership with an NGO on the basis of shared objectives and resources and mutually agreed actions, and subcontracting an NGO to carry out specific services. The latter can be a useful practice in certain situations. However, FAO recognizes the need to promote cooperation based on partnership because it is the most effective way of harnessing energies to work together towards common goals. This requires going beyond generic talk of participation in project formulation, implementation and evaluation to look at whether programmes are actually negotiated with civil society actors, resulting in clear responsibilities for all concerned.
NGO/CSO involvement has to begin at the stage of setting overall country policy and programme frameworks so that collaboration in specific programmes and projects can follow more easily. Ensuring this early involvement requires more effective information dissemination and capacity building. The national Food for All Campaigns and the thematic groups of the ACC Network on Rural Development and Food Security can facilitate civil society participation in designing strategies and programmes.
To enhance action partnerships, FAO will:
i) Experiment and learn from experience
* developing pilot projects with NGOs/CSOs to experiment with new ways of working together and promoting the sustainability of agricultural programmes;
* documenting successful experiences and replicating them elsewhere, and organizing exchange visits to FAO and NGO field projects;
* devising a data collection system and monitoring the evolution of NGO/CSO cooperation within FAO's Field Programme.
ii) Develop appropriate cooperation procedures
* including NGO/CSO participation in standard guidelines for country and sector programming and for project appraisal, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
* reviewing FAO's operational, contractual and procurement procedures to identify ways in which they could hamper NGO/CSO cooperation, and to propose remedial measures.
iii) Respond to NGO/CSO technical assistance and capacity-building needs
* FAO has had a positive experience in NGO/CSO capacity building, for example with the FAO/NGO cooperation programme in South Asia, support for farmers' organizations in the Sahel and the development of training programmes and materials for agricultural cooperatives. FAO is also well placed to work with governments to facilitate an enabling environment for civil society cooperation in agricultural development, natural resource management and food security. Building on this experience, as resources permit, FAO will:
- identify needs and formulate capacity-building programmes for farmers' organizations and NGOs to enhance their role as interlocutors in policy and programme formulation, and to strengthen their ability to provide services to rural communities;
- meet the training needs of local organizations whose involvement is desired in programmes formulated by FAO by building a training component into the programme design and budget.
iv) Enhance NGO/CSO involvement in FAO-promoted programmes
* Thematic technical assistance programmes. FAO's Field Programme cuts across normative and operational distinctions. Many technical assistance activities are normative in that they help governments and other national institutions apply accepted technical criteria or codes of conduct. Conversely, fieldwork is an indispensable ingredient of normative work and a prime conduit for feeding in NGO/CSO experience. Thematic programmes, often linked to global conventions, are becoming an increasingly important feature of FAO's activities (e.g. implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and integrated pest management). FAO will:
- involve NGOs/CSOs from the planning phase of thematic technical programmes and make provision for their involvement in programme budgets.
* Special Programme for Food Security. Partnership with non-state actors is inherent in the SPFS approach. The SPFS offers opportunities to compare and learn from FAO and NGO field experience and to bring constraints perceived by farmers at the local level to the attention of policy-makers at various levels. In some countries, farmers' organizations have been involved from the earliest identification and planning phases. Some NGOs are being subcontracted to implement specific activities. In other countries, however, farmers' organizations, local NGOs and others need to be more effectively involved in the SPFS. FAO will:
- involve representatives of farmers' organizations and NGOs in observing the SPFS in selected countries, in order to learn from and replicate the experience gained in the most successful programmes;
- organize meetings with NGOs/CSOs to give them more detailed information on the SPFS, provide occasions for the exchange of experience and examine ways in which NGOs/CSOs could make substantive contributions;
- make a systematic effort to identify and involve appropriate non-state actors from the earliest phases of project identification and include them in the national formulation teams.
* Early warning systems, disaster preparedness planning and relief and rehabilitation operations. FAO is one of the few actors in humanitarian assistance that is involved in all phases of emergencies, from designing prevention measures, issuing early warnings and formulating disaster preparedness programmes prior to the onset of an emergency, through the relief phase and the various stages of rehabilitation and recovery. FAO is well equipped to respond in all phases, drawing on a broader range of expertise than most other bilateral or international organizations.
NGOs cooperate with the Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) as providers and users of information and with the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS). They are FAO's main implementing partners in emergency interventions, particularly in complex emergencies where the state does not have adequate and immediate capacity to provide vulnerable populations with services concerning food production, nutrition and food security. To strengthen these partnerships further, FAO will:
- develop formal partnership agreements with major NGOs with which cooperation is ongoing;
- promote dialogue with NGOs/CSOs aimed at improving the relief-rehabilitation-development continuum;
- coordinate action with NGOs/CSOs to assist governments in food security monitoring.
2.4 Resource mobilization
The share of ODA channelled through Northern NGOs/CSOs to their counterparts in the South is growing, and an increasing proportion of development assistance is also coming from private sources. This trend is likely to continue, particularly in the context of decentralized cooperation programmes. It reflects a perception that NGOs are flexible and cost-effective providers of support at the community level and, more broadly, the changing roles of development actors discussed above. FAO needs to identify and build on complementarities with NGOs and to help them apply their resources effetively towards achieving agricultural development goals.
The NGO paper^6 prepared for this review states the case for cooperation in resource mobilization in the following terms, which FAO broadly endorses:
"FAO's role is essentially broker rather than banker .... The Organization's work in capacity building and the promotion of partnerships can help both governments and civil society to attract and use resources well.
For many donors, NGO participation in field programmes is an inducement to their support. FAO could systematically incorporate components for work with NGOs in programmes it presents to funders. FAO could provide NGOs with technical support to make their programmes more attractive to donors.
It is not likely that strengthened FAO/NGO cooperation will greatly increase the provision of funds by the one to the other. NGOs may, however, mobilise resources for and implement activities parallel to and supportive of FAO programmes without any transfer of funds taking place. When they really feel "joint ownership" of a project proposal, they can be relied upon to approach bilateral and multilateral donors in support of an FAO request."
To enhance collaboration in resource mobilization, FAO will take action in the following areas:
* NGO-FAO programmes, promoting programmes operated in partnership with NGOs/CSOs in which FAO would receive funding from NGOs specifically for technical assistance/capacity-building components;
* UN funding sources, reviewing the interest of UN system funding sources in NGO/CSO cooperation and taking advantage of the new opportunities for partnerships that are opening up in their investment and technical assistance activities;
* FAO/Government Cooperative Programme, exploring possibilities within this Programme and in new approaches to decentralized authorities by including the issue of FAO-NGO cooperation in meetings with donors;
* TCP, providing technical assistance (with government endorsement) to strengthen NGOs/CSOs and involve them where appropriate in implementing grassroots development activities. NGOs could be expected to provide matching funds for jointly formulated projects;
* TeleFood, using resources mobilized through TeleFood as a source of cofunding for grassroots initiatives. Once established with one NGO, arrangements of this nature could be extended to other partners.

3. Managing NGO/CSO cooperation in FAO
Organizational changes in FAO are facilitating cooperation with external partners at headquarters and in the field. The World Food Summit process, the NGO consultations held in connection with technical committee sessions, the review of FAO/NGO cooperation and the current strategic planning exercise have created momentum and brought many ideas to the fore. This section discusses the areas in which FAO will act to take advantage of this positive environment.
3.1 Revising formal status and meeting attendance
Procedures for granting formal status to NGOs will be reviewed, taking into account changes made elsewhere in the UN system. More flexible formal arrangements for cooperation will be explored. In connection with the ongoing examination of governance by the Programme and Finance Committees of the Council, procedures for NGO/CSO participation in FAO meetings will be reviewed to enhance the involvement of relevant organizations. On the basis of these reviews, a proposal will be submitted to the FAO Conference. A mechanism will be established in future to define jointly with NGOs/CSOs an overall code of relations governing FAO-NGO/CSO cooperation and identifying mutual responsibilities.
3.2 Integrating partnerships in FAO's programme planning
FAO's planning process will give attention to NGOs/CSOs, as has already been done in the preparation of the Strategic Framework for FAO. Technical units will be encouraged to use Regular Programme funds to further their collaboration with NGOs/CSOs both in developing approaches and methods and in national-level validation of experiences.
3.3 Promoting a "partnership culture" within FAO
This policy and strategy paper will provide impetus for a "partnership culture" within FAO. It will be backed up by:
* the development of guidelines for FAO staff in the form of a handbook on working with external partners;
* the incorporation of briefings on cooperation with external partners in staff training sessions;
* participation with other UN agencies and programmes in system-wide sensitization initiatives.
3.4 Strengthening the capacity of decentralized offices to build relations with civil society
FAO will:
* Dialogue with civil society at the national and regional levels, keep track of new experiences and identify innovative and effective organizations that support the interests of FAO's ultimate beneficiaries. In this regard, the FAO Representations and Regional Offices will play a key role in close collaboration with other UN organizations under the Resident Coordination system.
* Issue clear mandates and guidelines for decentralized offices
- including responsibility for NGO/CSO cooperation in the terms of reference;
- preparing guidelines on working with NGOs/CSOs at the country and regional/ subregional levels, based on the relevant proposals presented in Section 2. Decentralized offices will be asked to help survey and monitor NGOs/ CSOs and maintain national-level databases in collaboration with other UN agencies (software for a common UN database is being developed).
* Identify resources for civil society cooperation by decentralized offices
- designating a staff member in each regional and subregional office to act as an NGO-CSO focal point;
- recruiting more staff with NGO experience and seeking additional human resources from the APO and Young Professionals Programmes or NGO secondments;
- encouraging FAORs to use TeleFood project funds to build partnerships with CSOs;
- seeking resources for specific activities from local offices of NGOs and bilateral and multilateral agencies.
3.5 Strengthening Headquarters' capacity and Organization-wide networking
Consultations carried out in the framework of this review have produced a substantial list of services expected from TCDN, as FAO's focal point for NGO cooperation. These functions could not be performed if they depended only on TCDN. FAO can only respond adequately to the opportunities for greater collaboration with NGOs by vesting responsibility throughout the Organization, promoting in-house partnerships and harnessing existing resources and opportunities.
The NGO working group created for the review will be formalized and extended to the divisional level in the larger technical departments and to selected decentralized offices. It will serve as FAO's reference and outreach group in carrying out the following functions:
* Policy/strategy formulation
- formulating policy and operational guidelines on cooperation with civil society;
- following evolutions in civil society cooperation and exchanging information on best practices with other UN agencies.
* Information/coordination
- promoting networking and the exchange of information among FAO units at headquarters and the field;
- developing information/documentation exchange and dialogue with CSOs;
- establishing, at the headquarters level, a database on CSOs with which FAO is cooperating, incorporating information provided by technical departments - this will complement the data maintained at the country level on national NGOs;
- monitoring the implementation of FAO's NGO/CSO strategy.
* Promoting and learning from action
- promoting innovative cooperation activities and the assessment and diffusion of these experiences;
- facilitating technical units' and field offices' efforts to strengthen their collaboration with civil society.

4.Technical issues
While conducting their own reviews of their cooperation with NGOs, FAO's technical departments identified key areas in which they see NGO/CSO involvement as particularly critical in the medium term. This section presents only a small selection of these issues to illustrate in concrete terms the scope for enhanced partnership.
Agricultural trade liberalization
FAO has a major programme of technical assistance in Uruguay Round follow-up activities that is likely to be intensified in the next few years as the process of further trade liberalization in agriculture is pursued at WTO. NGOs have built up related capacity over the years, and this could be drawn on to address issues of the reform process and provide feedback from NGOs working in the field.
FAO has worked closely with some NGOs on Uruguay Round matters. This has proved to be very useful in keeping certain issues before public attention. Collaboration on trade matters between FAO and NGOs was intense during the process leading to the World Food Summit, especially in the context of the consultations organized by FAO at the regional level. The close collaboration continued at the NGO Forum during and after the Summit. For example, FAO reviewed and commented on the NGO position paper on trade issues, which was subsequently forwarded to the Singapore Ministerial Conference. FAO has also been closely associated with NGO initiatives related to ways and means of implementing the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries.
In the future, FAO will continue this constructive collaboration with NGOs, in particular drawing on their assessments of the impact of trade liberalization on vulnerable groups in developing countries and their identification of issues of concern to these countries. As in the past, FAO will also take part in major NGO initiatives, providing them with information and analysis of ongoing trade issues and thus helping them to conduct well-informed campaigns to influence public opinion.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was negotiated over a period of two years with the active participation of many of FAO's member countries and important national and international fisheries NGOs representing environmental, industry and small-scale fisheries' and fishworkers' interests. It was adopted by the FAO Conference at its Twenty-eighth Session in 1995.
The Code is directed towards all states and fishing entities, organizations and persons concerned with the conservation of fishery resources and the management and development of fisheries. It establishes general principles and standards of conduct for responsible fisheries and specific criteria for the elaboration of national policies. It defines policy objectives such as the contribution of fisheries to food security and food quality, emphasizing the nutritional needs of local communities.
Activities in support of the implementation of the Code are the priority of the Fishery Department's current and medium-term work programme. NGOs must play a central role, since it is through these organizations that the contents of the Code can be effectively disseminated, especially to the millions of small-scale, artisanal and indigenous fishworkers whose active participation is essential to achieve responsible fishing practices and to protect their interests and livelihoods.
The Code was one of the important areas identified for future collaboration between FAO and NGOs in a meeting held in conjunction with the Twenty-first Session of the Committee on Fisheries in 1996. Consequently, an umbrella programme to support NGOs in the implementation of the Code was developed jointly by various NGOs and FAO. The programme's aims include enhanced awareness of the contents of the Code among all stakeholders, participation with governments in the elaboration of national strategies for its implementation, and the development of improved institutional arrangements for participatory fisheries and coastal area management regimes and the development of responsible aquaculture practices.
Access to land and natural resources
Access to land and natural resources is crucial to agriculture, food security and income generation and has been a key focus of FAO since its establishment in 1945. Land tenure and agrarian reform have always been concerned with efficiency and social equity, but the major methods for achieving these goals have varied over time, as have their precise sets of beneficiaries.
Whereas, in the past, emphasis was placed on providing access to those without land rights, more importance has been given recently to increasing the tenure security of those who already have some rights, but for whom unclear, short-term or insecure rights constrain investments. Because Member Governments often have limited human and financial resources, poor public awareness and the non-application of new reforms and policies have constituted major problems in many countries, particularly in rural areas. Given these trends, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of combining government-generated legislative, juridical and administrative changes, with support to more non-governmental and local-level processes, such as land markets and rural institutions involved in land and resource management.
Collaboration among government, rural producers, CSO/NGOs and FAO now appears essential for sustainable improvements in land tenure. Such collaboration would combine governmental legitimacy and farmers' knowledge with the field-based long-term perspective of NGOs/CSOs and the technical expertise of FAO.
* NGOs/CSOs would:
- identify problems and constraints in achieving sustainable improvements and articulate local needs;
- through information and training, support the development of forums that increase the representation, legitimacy and bargaining power of key groups that have been traditionally underrepresented or disadvantaged in land management decisions, such as women, tenant organizations, occupational castes and transhumant pastoralists.
* FAO would:
- bring the lessons learned through worldwide experience to bear on national and local problems and provide guidelines on what is needed for technically sound and sustainable land rights systems.
Biodiversity
There is increasing recognition worldwide of the value of local knowledge systems in agriculture and rural development, and of the fact that rural people, with their detailed, holistic, integrated and interactive knowledge of local ecosystems, are experts in their own right. They are capable of classifying and structuring environmental data and knowledge using their own terminologies, understanding environmental processes and developing skills and strategies for natural resources management and sustainability. They have existing systems for transmitting knowledge both within their immediate cultural group and to outside groups. Local knowledge systems are, by nature, gendered. Men and women often have very different skills and knowledge which, together, create a knowledge system specific to local conditions, needs and priorities. Their social roles and relationships are also part of this knowledge system and its use, preservation and adaptation.
FAO has been supporting the work of national and regional NGOs in three regions: Latin America, South Asia and the region of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Activities include:
* carrying out in-depth studies of gender-based differences in local knowledge systems;
* developing mechanisms for the implementation of gender-sensitive policies, programmes and participatory technology development for the in situ conservation, sustainable use and management of agrobiodiversity for food security
FAO will continue to work with NGO partners in following up and expanding on the above activities to promote implementation of gender-responsive strategies and programmes for building on local knowledge systems in the conservation, use and management of agrobiodiversity.
Organic agriculture
Because organic agriculture is emerging as a viable sustainable approach practised by a growing number of farmers around the world, FAO has recently included it on its agenda for future work. The potential contribution of organic agriculture to sustainable production and improved livelihoods, market opportunities for developing countries, and the need for market regulation and technical assistance are areas in which FAO can assist its member countries.
NGOs and farmers have been promoting this form of agriculture for more than two decades, in the absence of formal technical or policy support. NGOs are not in a position to perform some of the functions carried out by FAO; for example, advising governments on sustainable farming alternatives, settling disputes on international markets for organic labelling or systematically collecting and disseminating information to assist farmers in their decisions. On the other hand, FAO does not have the technical experience in organic farming techniques, or the field network, that NGOs have. Collaboration between the two, drawing on respective strengths and opportunities, can greatly assist advances in organic agriculture.
The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and FAO have held a brainstorming seminar to share knowledge and identify areas of future cooperation. Plans are under way to implement field projects jointly. Regular consultations are held by e-mail on several initiatives. It is hoped that this joint venture will provide an example of how FAO can respond to the needs of farmers, in both its field and headquarters policy work, through collaboration with NGOs.
Integrated pest management
FAO projects work extensively in Asia with NGOs in implementing participatory integrated pest management (IPM). IPM programmes in Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam carry out NGO-government, South-South, technical and farmer-to-farmer field exchanges as well as longer-term cooperative work with farmers' field schools. These cooperative initiatives have mutually strengthened local, national and regional IPM programmes in rice, vegetables, tea, fruit and other crops. Global, regional and national NGOs in Africa, Latin America and the Near East have sought and received technical and policy advice from FAO on IPM and pesticide risk reduction. NGOs have adapted the farmers' field school approach from IPM field training given in association with FAO for in situ conservation, selection, exchange and utilization of genetic resources in the Philippines and Viet Nam.
The Global IPM Facility, cosponsored by FAO, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), works with NGOs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Near East in identifying new opportunities and providing technical and financial support for IPM implementation and policy reform. Globally, FAO cooperates with policy-oriented NGOs - those affiliated with the Pesticide Action Network - especially in the implementation of the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides. NGOs have been instrumental in national and international application of the Prior Informed Consent procedure, and activities concerning methyl bromide and persistent organic pollutants.
Genetic resources for food and agriculture
The Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture provides an international forum for the discussion of all aspects of the conservation and sustainable utilization of genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Commission is an intergovernmental body, but international NGOs regularly attend as observers and have contributed effectively to a number of debates and to the formulation of relevant policies. The Commission monitors and oversees the implementation of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, which is currently being revised by countries in the Commission in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity. The revised Undertaking is likely to be a binding instrument and probably a protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which will regulate multilateral access and benefit sharing in relation to plant genetic resources and will contribute to the realization of farmers' rights.
NGOs have also contributed to the discussions regarding the development of codes of conduct on the collection and transfer of genetic resources and on biotechnology as it affects the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources; the establishment of the World Information and Early Warning System on Plant Genetic Resources (WIEWS); the establishment of the International Network on Ex Situ Germplasm Collections, under the auspices of FAO; and the realization of farmers' rights. NGOs played an important role in the preparatory process for the Fourth International Technical Conference on Plant Genetic Resources (Leipzig, 1996) which was overseen by the Commission; the Technical Conference adopted the Global Plan of Action on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

ANNEX
Recent innovations in UN system relations with NGOs
* All major entities of the UN system have engaged in fundamental reviews of their relations with CSOs, resulting in policy statements, institutional reforms and more focused cooperation. Guidelines for working with NGOs are being developed, procedures for granting formal relations are being revised and NGO liaison offices are being strengthened and integrated more closely with their organizations' substantive programmes.
* Most UN agencies and programmes now hold periodic consultations with CSOs. Many, including the World Bank, IFAD and WFP, have created standing NGO advisory committees to facilitate dialogue.
* New forms of governance are emerging that involve the formal participation of NGOs, such as in the governing body of UNAIDS or the Inter-Agency Standing Committee on Humanitarian Affairs.
* Innovative and often informal arrangements for UN interaction with civil society actors at the international level are being developed in forms such as panels and briefing sessions. UNIDO and UNCTAD have experimented successfully with workshops bringing together NGOs and the private sector around issues of common concern.
* Proposed NGO amendments have been given official recognition alongside government texts in the preparatory meetings of Habitat II, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests.
* The UN has established a focal point for NGOs and civil society in the Office of the Secretary-General and re-established Interdepartmental Working Groups on NGOs in New York and Geneva.
* Operational cooperation with NGOs has increased significantly (in the case of the World Bank from 6 percent of projects approved in 1988 to more than 50 percent in 1996). Programmatic and institutional mechanisms are being developed such as the UNHCR's Partners-in-Action process and the memorandums of understanding that WFP signs with major NGO partners. UNDP is finalizing procedures for project execution by NGOs. Financing or cofinancing of joint development and other activities between the UN system and CSOs is increasing, with emphasis on programmes of capacity building for civil society.
* Cooperation with local NGOs is being developed by the UN system's decentralized offices, particularly UNDP and the World Bank, more than half of whose Resident Missions now have designated staff responsible for NGO partnership. Encouraging CSOs' participation in national policy dialogue is seen as an important role for the UN system.
* UN bodies have reviewed their information disclosure policies and are increasing their capacity to deliver appropriate information through the use of new communication technologies and national channels.

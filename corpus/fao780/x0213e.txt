Objectives
This Manual is intended for outreach workers engaged in agricultural and rural development programmes and projects, especially where activities are carried out in direct contact with local communities, households, families or individuals, both women and men. By using this Manual, the outreach worker will:
first,
enhance his/her knowledge on (i) linkages between population and development, and (ii) the important social and economic role women play for the benefit of their own families and the entire rural community and,
second,
be provided with a wide range of ideas and methods by which he/she can integrate gender-sensitive population messages in the ongoing non-formal (i.e. out-of-school) education and training activities in rural areas.
Although the focus is on the importance of women's roles in managing livelihood resources for the wellbeing of rural population, the Manual should be not used for addressing women only but, as much as possible, it should be a tool for addressing a mixed, female and male audience.

How to use this manual
How to use this manual
* Read first Module 1 - Part A (Population and Rural Women). This is a must before making any further use of this Manual. Then read Part B. which familiarizes you with possibilities for integrating non-formal population education (NFPE) in various activities regularly carried out, directly addressing the rural population (women and men).
* Module 2 shows how specific "population messages" can be conveyed. For each of the five proposed messages, specific lessons are designed, suggesting possible methods to be used.
* If you wish to see how teaching (i.e., conveying population messages) can be done using one particular method, please refer to Module 3. However, if you wish to use anther method, you can acquaint yourself with the explanation of various methods in Module 5.
* The population messages presented do not have to be taught in their order of appearance in this Manual. Depending on the needs of your audience, you can adopt your own order of presentation.
* Some of the content and questions/answer/exercises may also need to be adjusted to suit the type of audience, such as for example, young male and/ or female adults, with no or only one or two children, engaged in farming and food processing and marketing, or in other rural activities (e.g. home keeping crafts, services, etc.)
* Before any population education activity is undertaken, it is advisable that you read the reference materials in Module 4, many of which are applicable to the population messages to be conveyed through the lessons you decide to teach. This way, you will be able to grasp the topic even better.

Module 1 - Rural women in non-formal population education
Purpose:
* This Module provides basic background on the population situation and the problems common to rural women in South East Asia.
* The importance of integrating non-formal population education (NFPE) in rural development programmes and projects is discussed.
Part A - Population an rural women
Population of South East Asia
* More than 50% of the population in South East Asia depends on agriculture for a living.
* Except for Malaysia and Singapore, the rest of the countries in the region have economies based on agriculture.
* South East Asia is composed of the following countries:
- Brunei Darussalam
- Myanmar (formerly Burma)
- Indonesia
- Philippines
- Cambodia
- Singapore
- Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos)
- Thailand
- Malaysia
- Viet Nam

* Total fertility rate represents the average number of children that would be born alive to a woman if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years (i.e., age 15 to 49) conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (i. c., The number of live bir the per 1,000 women at different child-bearing ages) of a given year.
Role of rural women in the Region
* More than two-thirds of South-East Asian population is rural and the majority will remain rural for decades to come (UN Population Division, 1993.)
* A large portion of the rural population in this region are women who are engaged in various types of agricultural work such as planting crops, food processing, animal husbandry, inland fisheries and marketing of agricultural products. Women farmers comprise a significant proportion of the total agricultural labour force in most countries, ranging from approximately 35% in the Philippines to over 60% in Thailand (FAO/UNFPA, 1991.)
Figure
* Though their role in agriculture is vital for the well-being of families and the society as a whole, women nevertheless carry a triple burden in their everyday lives: as wives and mothers, as agricultural producers and as community workers.
* As daughters, women often have primary responsibility far the care of the aged.
* As wives and mothers, women are expected to be responsible for childbearing. child-rearing and taking care of their husbands.
Figure
* As agricultural producers/ marketers, women are expected to sow, plant, weed, harvest, process and sell the crops.
Figure
* As community workers, women serve as volunteers for health, livelihood and other social development programmes.
Figure
It is unfortunate women have not been given equal recognition in society, compared to men. This is shown by the fact that women have lower levels of literacy and education, lower income and social status, and less participation in political affairs and in decision-making. Women also work for longer hours and often are not paid for most of the work that they do.
Problems encountered by South East Asian women
What are the problems that have kept women from getting into their rightful place in rural development?
Sex discrimination
* Women are still regarded as the inferior sex. Note these comments from some people in the region:
Figure
* In the above examples, the low regard for women has the effect of increasing population. How? The wives are expected to have more children until they meet the desired number of sons.
* Other forms of discrimination against women:
- Most women cannot get financial credit on their own because they do not own land, cattle or other types of collateral. Often, their husband's approval is needed to obtain credit or a loan.
Figure
- The narrow economic opportunities for rural women lower their self-confidence. This strengthens their notion that, for them to be useful, they must give their husbands the number of children the latter desire.
- Unequal pay for equal work. In some countries in the region, women are paid lower than men for the same amount and quality of work.
All of the above are true, even if the Constitutions of most countries in South East Asia affirm the equality between men and women.
* For example, the Constitution of Malaysia states that: "All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law."
* The Thai and Indonesian Constitutions have the same provision as that of Malaysia.
* The Philippine Constitution is more explicit in its regard for women:
The state recognizes the role of women in nation building, and shall ensure the fundamental equality before the laws of men and women. (Sec. 14, Art. 11, 1986 Constitution of the Philippines).
* However, a basic problem is that laws governing the rights of women are usually not enforced.
Figure
Non-involvement in family decision
* Most women cannot take part in making decisions important to their lives. These include matters like childbearing and how the household income will be spent.
Figure
* It has been recorded worldwide, however, that if women are able to take a more active part in making decisions, the quality of family life will improve. There will be fewer and well-spaced children. A bigger part of the family income will be spent on such basic needs as food, health and education. Studies have shown that women tend to put priority on these needs rather than on items like clothing and household appliances.
Figure
* Women do not get the same recognition (financial, social, legal, etc.) as men for their contributions to agricultural development.
* Worse, women do not have much choice in childbearing, which is one of the most important aspects of their lives.
* Few realize that this lack of choice (whether or not to have children) is a factor in the increase of population.
* The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 1990 Report says: "If women who wanted no more children had the choice there would be a 38% reduction in the births and a 29% drop in maternal deaths worldwide."
* Rapid growth of the rural population has resulted in worsening living conditions for family households and entire communities. For women, this has made the job of obtaining resources, such as water and fuel, and ensuring stability of family nutrition, more difficult.
* An increase in family size means that less land will be available for cultivation for each member of the family if the inheritance is divided equally.
* All the above, in turn, hamper the effective planning and delivery of rural development programmes and projects.
Part B - NFPE
Non-formal population education (NFPE)
* Non-formal population education (NFPE), also known as out-of-school population education, can be considered as life-long, continuous means of upgrading one's knowledge, attitudes and skills on population - related concerns affecting individual, family and community well-being.
* NFPE is versatile. It can be integrated into ongoing rural development programmes and the regular activities of outreach workers.
* Where there is also a formal process of population education, it can be complemented and strengthened by NFPE.
Activities where NFPE can be integrated
Population education can be integrated into the various activities of ongoing programmes and projects.
Below are examples of such activities:
Adult education/functional literacy trainings
* Sentence construction in reading/writing classes can impart simple gender sensitive population messages.
* For example:
- Father helps mother in cleaning the house.
- Father takes care of little sister.
Figure
Agricultural extension training/orientation
* The role of agricultural extension training in non-formal population education is crucial. Training in food production, for instance, can easily integrate health and population concerns even by way of illustration.
* A favorite example is the analogy given by Philippine Secretary of Health Dr. Juan Flavier. He cited that papaya fruits grow bigger and sweeter when there are only few of them on the tree.
Figure
Cooperatives
* In forming a cooperative, there is usually a value-formation portion in the training.
* Population messages as they relate to cooperative development, can be discussed during the training, and also during meetings.
* In forming a cooperative there is usually a value-formation portion in the training that can highlight the fact that the bigger the family size, the smaller is the share per family member.
Figure
Health Education
* Health education classes conducted by both government and non-government organizations always provide opportunities for incorporating population education.
* Malnutrition, poor hygiene and unsound sanitation contribute to infant and child mortality in developing countries. This may result in high fertility levels as couples try to compensate for high infant and child mortality.
Women's Organizations
* The process of organizing women entails orientation/reorientation sessions, where gender concerns and population issues can be introduced.
* It is therefore natural that in above sessions, such as the role of women in agricultural development, women's reproductive rights, and other such topics be discussed.
Figure
Farmers' Organizations
* Farmers' organizations have a wide range of opportunities for integrating population and development messages.
* For instance, during training on new technologies concepts on human reproduction can be introduced. Seasonal production, where the conditions are suited to the optimum growth of certain types of crops can be compared to the idea of spacing the children, so they come at the proper season. That is, if the time is right for having a child, the family will be financially and emotionally prepared. In addition to that, the mother is physically ready for the demands of a (new) child.
Figure
Home Economics Education
* In most South East Asian countries, home economics education usually prepare young girls to be good and productive housewives.
* In others, it is extension work that provides more skills to rural housewives/women on food preservation, dressmaking, handicrafts, etc.
* Sessions in home economics provide excellent opportunities for introducing population education messages. For instance, time allocation for household chores usually done by women can be shared by the male members of the family.
* The indirect effect on the decision of women not to have more children can be brought about by the skills introduced in home economics classes. Now that they have acquired new skills to earn additional income, women would be mare involved in the decision of whether or not to have more children.
Follow-up Support for Formal Education
* Follow-up support to formal education at the elementary level has been found to be effective.
* In the Philippines, for example, a method for following up lessons learned in the elementary school classrooms has been developed through the Teacher-Child-Parent Program. Nutrition and population messages are incorporated into lessons in Home Economics and Livelihood Education, Science, Mathematics, etc.
* The messages are transmitted to the parents through children's notebook/workbooks which the parents are made to sign.
* The teacher conducts home visits to provide assistance in understanding and appreciating the mesages being popularized.
Figure
Media
* Radio Plugs/Dramas
- Radio plugs are the most common, and perhaps the easiest method of popularizing population messages.
- A 30-second radio plug repeated several times a day has been found to be effective in guiding the actions of the listener.
- Serialized dramas can also incorporate population messages as part of the content.
- The advantage of using radio is that the audience could follow the programmes without interrupting their day-to-day activities.
- Workers planting rice, for instance, have radio as their constant companion, either through the music it generates, or through the group's favorite soap opera (drama series).
* School in the air
- This is a popular format among rural extension workers.
- Radio programs are usually scheduled early in the morning, presumably while the housewives are cooking breakfast.
- Extension workers provide support to the program by giving the school-on-the-air enrolees the needed workbooks/materials required by the program.
- The workers likewise monitor the responses to the questions posed in the radio program, to ensure that the learning by the enrolees is progressing as expected.
Figure
* TV Plugs/Drama/Quiz Shows
- Although messages from TV have more impact than those coming from the radio, they reach a smaller segment of the rural population. This is because in most communities in the region, only those from the higher income bracket have TV sets.
- Just like in the radio, soap operas, TV plugs and quiz shows can all be used as a means for disseminating population messages.
* Comics
- The highly visual and easy-to-read format of the comic magazines make them the preferred materials in rural communities.
- Comics have a distinct advantage because they can be passed on from one person to another, or they can be read over again for review
Figure
Networking and linkaging for NFPE
Persons/groups/organizations to link with
* Depending on the area, there are plenty of sources for support in conducting NFPE.
* Retired school teachers, for instance, have been found to be one of the most effective trainors/facilitators in NFPE.
* Community groups or organizations can be tapped to provide technical and material support for NFPE. The Primary Health Workers or their equivalent can provide information and manpower support for house-to-house campaigns.
* It is extremely important to be in close coordination with local health units, since most of the services needed by the population are delivered by this sector.
Figure
* Outside the communities, there are plenty of development organizations that can help boost our NFPE efforts. Appendix D provides a list of sub-national, national and even international organizations with whom to link.
Steps in Establishing and Maintaining Linkages for Non-Formal Education
In linking with other organizations for NFPE, it would be helpful to go through the following steps:
* Study the aims and objectives of the group/organization; find out their target groups and their area of coverage.
Figure
* Talk to the key persons in that group/organization. Tell them about the situation in your area, the objectives of the NFPE and the aspects of the work where you need most help. Where possible, it would be better if the members of the community/target groups for NFPE are included in this meeting. Later on, the community members can be the ones to continue the linkages with these organizations.
Figure
* Get the commitment of the organization to support the NFPE. A simple, written agreement will go a long way towards clarifying expectations from both sides -- yours and that of the supporting group/organization.
Figure
* Invite representatives from the support group to observe/take part in the NFPE sessions. In this way, the commitment of this group/organization to assist the NFPE efforts shall be strengthened.
* Keep the support group/organization updated with the progress of your NFPE. If the group/organization is giving financial/material resources, the supporting group/organization would welcome an accounting of the donation or grant that they have given.
Organizing networks/institutional umbrellas to sustain NFPE
Eventually, it would be helpful to put together a network of organizations/ institutions to sustain the NFPE. This could be done by bringing together these support groups to regular meetings where they can discuss and plan out how they can coordinate and integrate their support to the NFPE.

Lesson 4 - Women in decision-making
Lesson 5 - Providing women with technology
Module 3 - How to conduct NFPE lessons
Purpose:
* This Module offers suggestions as to which step-by-step procedures could be applied in conducting each session.
* For each session, sample teaching procedures are illustrated.
Lesson 1 - Appreciating women's roles in the family and the community
1. Title : Appreciating Women's Roles in the Family and the Community
2. Message : Women have significant roles to play in the family and community as environmental resource managers; as producers of agricultural products; as educators; as care-givers or healers.
3. Objectives: Explain the roles of women as:
* environmental/resource managers
* producers of agricultural products
* educators
* care-givers or healers
4. Teaching Procedures: The facilitator will ask the participants to divide themselves into four groups.
- The facilitator will then ask each group to pick up one of the four sheets of paper describing (or depicting) the above mentioned "women's roles".
- Each of the four groups will be asked to depict or dramatize for three to five minutes the role they have extracted.
Figure
The rest of the participants will guess the roles of women, that have been acted out.
After all the roles have been presented, enumerate and group the roles of women, according to the following classifications:
- environment and resource managers
- agricultural producers
- educators
- care-givers or healers
The participants will be asked to discuss the significance or importance of each role to the development of the community.
The facilitator will summarize the role of women through the following statements:
- Women complement men's perspectives (different but equal).
- Women's roles in the family and society are as important as those of men.
- Women contribute significantly to improving the quality of life of the family and community through their roles as environment and resource managers.
- Women's roles determine the health and well-being of the family.
Figure
Lesson 2 - Pregnancy and spacing of births
1. Title : Pregnancy and Spacing of Births
2. Message : Pregnancies should be avoided below the age of 18 and above 35. Pregnancies should be at least two years apart.
3. Objectives:
* Discuss the most appropriate ages for women to be pregnant.
* Discuss the proper spacing between pregnancies.
* Discuss the health center services and facilities to space/avoid pregnancies.
4. Teaching Procedure: Storytelling
* The facilitator will ask the group to listen to the story of Dolores in Module 5.
* The facilitator will ask the group what they think is the right age to be pregnant and the right spacing of births.
* The facilator will then ask the participants to complete this statement: Pregnancy should start at the right age, otherwise:
* The participants may be asked to cite their own experiences as the basis for filling up the above statement. The facilitator can also ask the first question (at what age did you have your first child) to set the participants on track.
* The facilitator will explain the reasons why pregnancy should not occur below the age of 18 and above 35, and also why pregnancies should be spaced 2 years apart.
* The facilitator will make a synthesis using the analogy of the papaya tree (the more fruits in the tree, the smaller they are; the closely spaced the fruits, the smaller they are).
N.B. Facilitators may find some useful reference readings on this subject in Module 4.
Lesson 3 - Providing for the children's future
1. Title : Providing for the Children's Future
2. Message: We should balance the need for having more children to help us on the farm and in the house, with our capacity to provide for their basic needs and their future.
3. Objectives:
* Discuss the advantages of not having more than three children.
* Discuss the financial, emotional and other requirements for bringing up the children until they become economically productive adults.
4. Teaching Procedure: Group Discussion
* The facilitator will introduce the topic by asking the participants to state how many children they prefer and why.
* The facilitator will make a tally on the board for each reply, as shown below:
No. of Children
No. who Chose
Reasons
security/helper at home
etc.
* The facilitator will compare the economic contribution of a child working at home or on the farm against his/her needs.
* The facilitator will make a synthesis of the insights based on the lessons reamed.
EXERCISE
Discuss and answer the following questions as a group:
1. What do you think are our obligations to our children? Based on our present resources, how many children can we effectively support?
2. How much would it cost for one child to reach 20 years of age for the following items? Please make a rough estimate.

Lesson 4 - Women in decision-making
1. Title : Women in Decision-Making
2. Message: There is a need to involve women in decision-making, particularly for such important concerns as:
* childbearing
* child-rearing
* family health
* disposition of family income
* employment/participation in the labor force

- whether they will have another child
- whether the child will be allowed to plow the field
- whether to bring a sick child for consultation
- where to spend the income from the sale of coffee
- whether the wife will work in the community
- whether a deep well shall be dug near the house
* For each situation above, the participants will be given two minutes to simulate actual discussion and the decision that will be made. For each discussion, the husband and wife will be the main characters.
* For each decision, the participants will be asked to enumerate the merits/ negative aspects of the decision.
* The participants will be asked to review the stand made by the wife (woman) and its implications.
* After the simulation activities, the participants will be asked to comment on:
- the quality of the decision
- how binding the decision is
Lesson 5 - Providing women with technology
1. Title : Providing Women with Technology
2. Message: Women should have access to technologies that would make the work at home and agricultural production more efficient and reduce the need for her and her children's labor, time and inputs.
3. Objectives:
* Identify work where technology can ease the physical burden among women.
* Identify where technology can reduce time inputs needed by women.
* Enumerate ways by which such technology can benefit women.
* Discuss ways by which women's physical and economic access to technology can be improved.
4. Teaching Procedure: Demonstration/Return Demonstration
* The facilitator will invite a resource person who will demonstrate low-cost appropriate technology among the participants.
* The participants will be asked to use the technologies themselves.
* The participants will then enumerate other types of work/activities where technology can aid them.
* An open forum will follow so that the resource person can answer questions raised by the participants.
* The participants will enumerate ways by which their access to technology can be improved.
* The facilitator will synthesize the session through the use of a diagram highlighting the importance of technology and how it can be brought closer to the women.

Role of women in agriculture and rural development: policy issues
ROLE OF WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT: POLICY ISSUES^1
^1 Excerpts from: Stephens, Alexandra. "Gender Issues in Agricultural and Rural Development Policy in Asia and the Pacific". Regional Consultation on Gender Issues in Agricultural and Rural Development Policy. Bangkok, 1-5 November 1993. FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (RAPA), Bangkok.
Women, Sex And Gender
Gender applies to one sex or the other, and relates to the way each behaves in a given situation. While sex is a biological given, and can not (nominally) be changed, gender is a result of a socialization into a male or a female role which ascribes certain behaviour according to norms for one's sex. Agricultural policy makers have for decades fumed a blind eye to farmers who are women because they think of farmers as men, thus denying women's claim to participation in farming and other activities which directly affect their lives. As a result, rural women have lagged visibly behind most social and economic criteria.
Policy-makers have recently been confronted with some startling revelations about women farmers, derived from alternative data sources:
- women are a majority of all farmers in Asia, although invisible because their work is uncounted;
- their work day is longer than men's, and most have reached the frontiers of endurance in stretching their day;
- women harbour specialized knowledge, represent a pool of highly skilled labour in many areas of agriculture and rural development which are not shared with men;
- women increasingly head rural households, and/or are chief economic providers for their families;
- women's productivity is severely constrained by the fragmentation of their time, their dual and triple responsibilities and their lack of access to essential inputs including knowledge;
- the gap between rural men and rural women is steadily widening, with a growing percentage of women among the absolutely poor and destitute;
- small farm production is increasingly unattractive to males who abandon agriculture in favour of better remunerated work in other sectors, leaving women to eke out a living on often degraded land;
- there is no biological imperative for men to maintain a stronghold on technology;
- agricultural research and extension largely ignore the major concerns of women farmers - nutritious food crops, hardy planting materials, household food security, home storage and small scale processing, for example.
Rights and Status of Women Farmers
The word "farmer" invariably implies a male farmer. When women farmers receive a rare mention they are usually disguised as "housewives" or farmers' wives. Policy statements which do not specifically include women farmers automatically exclude them, because of this kind of thinking on the part of both male and female policy analysts. An inclusive policy statement has therefore to be explicit in saying "men and women, or male and female farmers" if the planners are going to address the needs of each, and if implementers are going to see that both are reached directly
In most countries legislative changes have been made to facilitate women's rights to inheritance and ownership of land, but in practice they still have difficulty in realizing the benefits which should flow from this. Similarly in credit programmes. Where women's direct access to agricultural credit was barred, many women found the dejure lifting of barriers did little to change their de facto situation, and further, that many bankers themselves were party to these infringements by commission or omission.
In Thailand for example it was necessary to change the legal term from a "housewife" to "women farmer" to allow access to agricultural credit, but even so, it remains rare for women to independently take official loans. Among a potential clientele of proven, bankable clients, little has been done by mainstream financial institutions to create an environment in which rural women feel welcome in agricultural and development bank credit departments.
Technology
No agriculture technology is gender neutral. Whether a hand tool, a machine, a storage bin or biotechnology, all carry different implications for men and women. Technologies are made by men and women for use by women and men, or specifically for one sex or the other. Most are developed with a male or female user in mind, i.e., they respond to the demand created by those who want to use them, and can afford to buy them. That already results in a bias determined by culturally ascribed division of labour, and the limits placed on women's access to finance. Thus we find farm women concentrated around the most menial, boring, low-paid, "low tech" activities, while men clamber aboard tractors and combine harvesters for their work.
In a market-economy, technology will address the needs of monied clientele first. Men have the money. In a centrally planned economy, social norms of patriarchy will dictate that the machines are for men; that girls and women are "incapable by reason of their sex, to understand, operate and maintain machines". In very few countries has this stereotype been fully challenged.
Conservation and Sustainability
In relation to conservation issues and sustainability, gender differentials are most obvious in rural areas when the environment is degraded. Women in most developing countries are adversely affected by this more than men, because they are responsible for many of the tasks which demand more inputs from them as degradation and depletion occur. One of the first demands is increasing time inputs. As degradation forces women to walk further in search of potable water and household fuel supplies, their workday becomes longer. As soils are degraded women find access to technologies for restoration and increasing yields barred or constrained by a multitude of social and economic hurdles which affect men less, or not at all. These include knowledge and information, and the whole range of technologies, credit and services.
Vicious circles of discrimination against women emerge as men leave polluted, degraded or depleted environments for greener pastures. Women are often less free to leave because of social responsibilities, and because they are ill-equipped by inferior education and less access to capital, to relocate. Left in a poor environment in the countryside, they are then forced for the very survival of their family, into unsustainable practices which further pollute, neglect, degrade and deplete the natural resource base. Females are often unable to cover all the tasks, particularly the heavy ones related to land preparation and conservation, formerly done by men.
Population Growth and Environmental Degradation
POPULATION GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION^2
^2 Excerpts from: FAO. "Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development in Asia and the Pacific", Regional Document No. 2., FAO/Netherlands Conference in Agriculture and Environment. 'S-Hertogenbosh, The Netherlands, 15-19 April 1991.
The Region has already reached the safe limits of horizontal expansion of agriculture, meaning future needs can only be met by intensification, an option which will not be easy due to widespread land degradation. A major cause of degradation is erosion due to water and wind. Only a very limited area is free from soil-related constraints on agricultural production. These constraints include steeply sloping land, severe fertility limitations, and mining of soil nutrients. Probably the most serious environmental threat is the rapid loss of forest cover. In general, the higher the population growth and density, the more severe the deforestation.
Population growth combined with other factors is causing widespread environmental deterioration. The other factors include: the breakdown of traditional systems of resource management which used to be kept in balance by social regulation of fertility, mortality, marriage and migration; the impact of commercial demand on traditional cultural attitudes of indigenous populations; and unequal access to land and other resources, as well a fragmentation of holdings. Policies to slow down population growth, and enhance alternative employment opportunities are a necessary component to strategies to attain sustainable agricultural development.
Pregnancy and spacing of births
PREGNANCY AND SPACING OF BIRTHS^3
^3 Taken from Facts for Life (UNICEF), 1988.
1. Becoming pregnant before the age of 18, or after the age of 35, increases the health risks for both mother and child.
* Every year over half a million women die from problems linked to pregnancy and childbirth, leaving behind over one million motherless children. Most of these deaths could be prevented by acting on today's knowledge about the importance of planning pregnancies.
* For health reasons alone, no girl should become pregnant before the age of 18. A woman is not physically ready to begin bearing children until she is about 18 years of age. Babies born to women younger than 18 are more likely to be born too early and to weigh too little at birth. Such babies are much more likely to die in the first year of life. The risks to the mother's own health are also greater.
All girls should be allowed time to become women before becoming mothers. In societies where many girls marry at an early age, couples should use family planning to delay the -first pregnancy until at least the age of 18.
* After the age of 35, the health risks of pregnancy and childbirth begin to increase again. If a woman is over the age of 35 and has had four or more previous pregnancies, then another pregnancy is a serious risk to her health and that of her unborn child.
2. The risk of death for young children increases by about 50% if the space between births is less than two years.
* For the health of both mothers and children, parents should wait until their youngest child is at least two years old before having another baby.
* Children born too close together do not usually develop as well, physically or mentally, as children born at least two years apart.
* One of the greatest threats to the health and growth of a child under the age of two is the birth of a new baby. Breastfeeding stops too suddenly, and the mother has less time to prepare the special foods a young child needs. Also, she may not be able to give the older child the care and attention he or she needs, especially during illness. As a result, the child often fails to grow and develop properly.
The Perpetuation of Poor Health Among Women and Girls^4
^4 Winicoff B. "Women's Health in Developing Countries". Wallace, H. M. et. al. Health Care of Women and Children in Developing Countries, Third Party Publishing Company, California, 1990.
* A mother's body needs two years to recover fully from pregnancy and childbirth. The risk to the mother's health is therefore greater if the next birth follows too closely upon the last. The mother needs to give herself time to get her strength and energy back before she becomes pregnant again.
* If a woman becomes pregnant before she is fully recovered from bearing a previous child, there is a higher chance that her new baby will be born too early and too light in weight. Low birth-weight babies are less likely to grow well, more likely to fall ill, and four times more likely to die in the first year of life than babies of normal weight.
3. Having more than four children increases the health risks of pregnancy and childbirth.
* After a woman has had four children, further pregnancies bring greater risks to the life and health of both mother and child.
Especially if the previous births have not been spaced more than two years apart, a woman's body can easily become exhausted by repeated pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and looking after small children. Further pregnancies usually mean that her own health begins to suffer.
* After four pregnancies, there is an increased risk of serious health problems such as anaemia ('thin blood') and hemorrhage (heavy loss of blood). The risk of giving birth to babies with disabilities, or with low birth-weight, also increases after four pregnancies and after the mother reaches the age of 35.
4. Family planning gives couples the choice of when to begin having children, how many to have, how far apart to have them, and when to stop.
* Most health services can provide several methods of safe, effective family planning. No one method of timing birth is suitable for, or acceptable to, every individual. Couples should ask advice about the most suitable means of family planning from the nearest trained health worker or family planning clinic.
* Spacing births at least two years apart, and avoiding pregnancies before the age of 18 and after the age of 35, can help to ensure that each baby is born healthy and strong.
Providing for the children's future
A. Family size, pressure on land resources and migration
In many villages, the main problem is the growing pressure on land resources. There are more people, yet less land on which to grow food. This provides a logical approach for pointing out the benefits of having few children.
The small farmers and his wife usually have only about two hectares of land or even less from which they have to provide the food, clothing and other needs of the family. They get very little money, just one third of what the average workers in the country get. As the number of their children increases, it becomes more difficult to support them. It is even more difficult for those who have no land and depend on farm labour for income.
As you talk to the women and men in the cooperatives and other agricultural programmes, you can present the following ideas:
- If the farm is small and there are many children, it will be further divided into smaller portions with each succeeding generation.
- If there are many children on a small farm, there will not be enough work for all the members of the family.
- Many men and grown-up children cannot get work in the fields or elsewhere because each year, more children become old enough to look for jobs. So they leave the villages to look for work in the towns or cities.
- When the men or the older sons leave for other places, the women are left as heads of the household. This means increased work and responsibilities for them.
- The women have to take care of the family farm without improved agricultural skills, attend to the children and all other matters regarding the household. They cannot depend on their husbands to send money regularly because it is sometimes a problem to find work in the urban areas.
- If the land they farm is in their husband's names, the women may not be permitted to make legal decisions. Neither can they make decisions on what crops to plant or whether to hire workers.
Some points for discussion:
1. What are the reasons why the fathers or the older boys leave the village for towns and cities?
2. How are women affected?
3. How is village life affected when men leave for towns and cities?
4. When the husband leaves for the town, how does the woman cope economically, socially, politically and in terms of time as the head of the household?
5. List the advantages and disadvantages when a rural family moves to a town or city.
6. If land is fragmented among many sons and/or daughters, what agricultural food production practices can they follow for economic gains?
Figure
B. Family size and need for increased production
In many countries, especially in regions of shifting cultivation, women do about 60-80% of agricultural production work. This usually means that women are not only the primary food producers for household consumption but are also actively involved in assisting men in the production of the major or cash crops. Some women often contribute to more than half of the income of households through subsistence farming, food sales, processing and trade.
These women will likely be interested in ways to increase their production, especially if they have many children to feed. You might meet them through agricultural cooperatives or through resettlement. You could then start them thinking about having smaller families by showing them what they will need to make their farms produce more food.
C. Some important ideas to consider:
Ideas to Consider:
To improve production, what do rural women need?
- Farmers need access to better seeds, pesticides, fertilizers and modern equipment. But these things cost money. If they have many children to feed, clothe and care for, where would they get extra income to improve food production?
- They need to learn skills for improved agricultural operations, for post-harvest practices and storage. But technical training and information on agriculture are usually given by the extension services to men because it is assumed that only the men are farmers. And because women are too busy with their work in the home and on the farm, they do not have time to attend training courses and demonstrations and try out improved packages of agricultural practices. They therefore, do not get the chance to increase their competence and efficiency.
- They also require access to credit for investment in production and other needs such as small machines that will save them hours of labour. But often they do not have the right to borrow money because of the laws. Land reform acts in some cases make conditions even more difficult for women. When the farmers are made owners of lands, the titles are given to men as heads of families. And because the women cannot own land, they cannot be members of agricultural credit associations nor take advantage of rural credit programmes.
- Women need knowledge on health and good nutrition so that they will be strong enough to carry out the back-breaking tasks in farming. If a woman gives birth frequently and at close intervals, she will become weak. She will not be able to work efficiently on the farm.
- Women need rural organizations to break their isolation and to provide them with access to outside ideas, information and services. Such organizations also provide group solidarity for collective action that individuals alone cannot take.
D. Family size and traditional attitudes towards children
You know that most of the villager have many children. Having many children is important to them because:
- They do not know how many of their children will survive, so they keep on having them.
- Most parents want a son, so they will keep having children until they have one or two sons.
- Children provide additional hands to work on the farm.
a. The girls help their mothers take care of the younger children and help carry water and firewood.
b. They assist in gathering and processing food and in selling this in the market. They also take care of the animals.
c. The boys help in irrigation, fishing and harvesting,
- Children are expected to take care of their parents in their old age.
- For the mother, childbearing is a sign of womanhood. It is her means of getting approval from her husband and from the community and of gaining influence in he household. For a man, having children is a sign of virility and manhood.
- Children give women the love and affection that they often do not get from their husbands, especially in societies where women have a very low position or where husbands are away much of the time. Children are a means of continuing the family line and carrying on customs and traditions.
- In some cultures, children are a sign of God's blessing and also a sign that the parents are doing what God wants them to do.
- They give the family social status.
Children have different values in different cultures. In some countries, they are valued more as a source of love and companionship. In other countries they may be more important as a source of help and old-age security.
Here are some ideas to start women and men thinking about smaller families. These ideas can easily be part of your extension education programmes.
- More children now live longer because health services in the rural areas are much better.
- These days, raising a child costs a lot. Each one will need food, clothing, school supplies, medicines and other things.
- It will take many years before a child can earn any income. Generally, children below the age of 11 cannot contribute much to productive activities in the villages.
- Children who go to school (as they should) can not be much help at home.
- The farmer will probably not need so many children to work on the farm as the land available becomes smaller and she or he learns improved methods of farming.
- At present, it is not just having money but also having well-educated and healthy children that gives social status to a family. This would be difficult to get if there are too many children in the family.
Some points for discussion:
1. How much does it cost to raise a child before he or she contributes economically and becomes productive?
List the items that are usually needed by children. You could include the following:
- nutritious foods
- clothing, school fees and school supplies
- costs of illness such as medicines
- marriage celebrations, gifts, dowry
- other religious ceremonies
- a piece of land.
2. What do you consider a sign of success in your village?
3. What are the advantages of having fewer children? What are the disadvantages?
4. What are the feelings in your village about having a few children?
E. How may family size affect education of children?
Some ideas to consider:
- Even if schooling is free, it entails many other expenses - for clothing, books and other supplies. If the family is large, some of the children may not be able to go to school; or the family may have to give up buying other needs for the home and the farm so that they can send their children to school.
- It is easier to educate fewer children who are spaced some years apart. They would not reach school age all at the same time and the parents would not be overburdened with school fees and expenses.
- If the mother has time to rest before another birth, she can attend to each of her children and give them a better start in their schooling.
- These days, children without education will find it difficult to look after their parents because it is usually the educated ones who get good jobs.
F. What are some of the results when a woman has schooling?
- She may understand and better accept new ideas which help her to improve her family and also help her acquire status in the community.
- She gains confidence and can take part in village organizations. She might even organize and lead groups to increase family income or increase efficiency of women's work or conserve resources.
These activities could take the place of childbearing in helping her gain status in her village.
In one village, although the people believed in the importance of having large families, a young woman with only one child was selected by the other village women to head the local women's organization because she was the most highly educated among them. This woman had the chance to get higher education because she had only one child.
- When a young girl has the opportunity of going to school, she usually gets married at a later age. She then starts having a family perhaps at 18 or past 20 rather than at 13. An educated girl could talk with her husband on an equal basis about the home and the farm and could, therefore, take a more active part in making decisions. Then, perhaps, she could also decide with her husband on the number of children they should have.
Figure
Some points for discussion:
1. Ask the women to give examples of village women who have improved their conditions because of education and having fewer children.
2. Ask the women their ideas on how girl's education can help them, their children and their lives.

Module 5 - Learning principles and technologies
Principles in conducting learning sessions
Some methods in conducting non-formal education sessions
Setting Learning
Module 5 - Learning principles and technologies
Purpose:
* The in conducting effective learning sessions are discussed in this module.
* Also discussed are some methods in conducting non-formal population education, as well as guidelines for setting objectives.
Principles in conducting learning sessions
The people that we work with have special needs. Thus, for the sessions to be effective, it would help if we kept the following principles in mind:
Make the presentation simple.
- Before starting the activity, decide on your central message.
- Enumerate the details that you would like to discuss to support your central message.
- You can ask yourself the questions below to check if you are saying or putting in just the right amount of information:
* What information does the audience NEED to know?
* What information is INTERESTING to know but is not that vital? You can weed out the latter if you do not have enough time.
Learning methods should be problem-posing.
- The learning sessions should address the concrete problems that women face in the family and in the community.
- As facilitator, you should be familiar with these problems/concerns before a session starts. At the beginning of a session you should confirm with the participants whether the right problems/concerns will be addressed.
- As part of the reaming process, the participants shall then be asked to express their perceived solutions to the problems.
- The illustration on page 56 is an example of why poor health is perpetuated among women and girls in some developing countries.
ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS.
THIS WILL ENABLE YOU TO
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS.
As much as possible, select learning methods that are active and participatory.
- Participants remember and absorb the lessons faster if they take an active part in the learning process, that is, they do not just sit there and listen to lectures or observe what's going on but are involved in actual learning activities. Learning methods should have the following features:
* Participants should be provided with opportunities to ask questions at certain points of the lecture/discussion.
* They must be made part of certain activities which will serve as reaming venues such as games, actual testing of instruments/ gadgets) machines if they are being taught how to use them, group work where they all contribute towards an output, etc.
Figure
Draw lessons from the participants, as they are the richest source for learning.
- The reamers have a bank of experiences that are the best sources of lessons most applicable to their situation.
- As facilitators, we can encourage the participants to share these experiences. From these we can draw out lessons that can be applied to the day-to-day life of the reamers
Figure
Avoid "women only" presentations, unless the sessions call for a special women's action.
- Experience in development efforts have shown that advocacy programs on women's development work better if the men are involved. After all, the men are part of the decision-making process at home and in the community.
- In most cases, the tasks of cooking and washing have still to be done by the women even if they are supposed to be participating full time in education sessions. Often, the women will come in late because these tasks have still to be done before they leave the house.
- Men and boys should share household chores with women and girls. This will allow women and girls to take more active role in activities outside the home.
Figure
There is strength in learning together.
- If learning is done with peers, there is constant reinforcement. There is also more encouragement to attend the sessions because of group pressure and fun.
Figure
We learn best when we are not under stress.
- Learning occurs best in a relaxed atmosphere. When we are tense, we find it hard to concentrate on the lesson.
- Help your participants to unburden themselves of stressful matters before the start of the session.
- You can ask them to share with the group (and write down) their most urgent concerns. For example, some of them might have problems with sick farm animals, or there is no water coming out from the irrigation, etc. You can ask them to make a resolution to forget temporarily those problems that cannot be immediately solved so they can attend to the most urgent ones.
- The facilitator makes a lot of difference in creating a relaxed atmosphere. If you are tense, the participants can sense it, and they will start to get tense, too. This is especially true in rural areas, where people are very sensitive to one's moods and predisposition.
Figure
Success reinforces learning.
- Learning sessions should build upon one successful activity after another, no matter how small.
Figure
- Every so often, you can stop to assess together with the participants, the progress that has been achieved (you can refer to the questions below).
- You can also refer regularly to the learning objectives as a way of measuring group success.
Figure
Some questions you can ask the group after each session:
1. What are our objectives for this session?
2. Were we able to meet the above objectives?
3. If yes, what are the factors that contributed to our success?
4. If no, why not?
5. How then should we improve our sessions so we can meet our objectives?
Some methods in conducting non-formal education sessions
House-to-house sessions
* We can schedule regular home visits to families in our area of coverage.
* However, it is important that we set the learning objectives clearly before each visit.
Figure
Guidelines for Home Visiting
1. Always be courteous. Even if you are familiar with the people in the household, always obey common laws of courtesy, i.e., greet them good morning, ask their permission to enter the house, etc.
2. Be sensitive to what is going on in the household. If you sense that they are busy, or perhaps resolving a family conflict, defer the visit, or make an appointment to return at a more convenient time (preferably within the same day). Then go and see another family.
3. Go straight to the point. Small talk is okay to make the people being visited at ease, but this should not fall into a rumor-mongering/gossip session.
4. If you have to use household resources like water, see to it that you use them sparingly.
5. Pack your own food if you expect your schedule to extend after meal time. This way, you avoid being a burden on the people. However, if you are invited to partake of the food, make sure that everybody has eaten and there is enough to share.
6. Transform your negative observations into opportunities for improvement. For example, if you see garbage all over the place, you can ask them if they have any problems in garbage disposal. Then, you can help them from there.
7. Be familiar with rural customs and belief systems. This way, you can avoid offending some people, who put much importance on customs/ traditions.
Song/Poem Writing Contest and Song/Poem Analysis
* Songs are one of the most common ways of expressing ideas and sentiments among the rural folk
* Song analysis is also an excellent method of clarifying and emphasizing ideas.
* Popular songs can be adapted to impart population messages. These can be easily recalled by the audience and even the children can sing them.
* The same mechanics can apply to poem writing, in areas where the people prefer this type of expressing.
(Below is an example of a song that emphasizes family planning)
Responsible Parenthood
Ito ang Responsible Parenthood
Magplano ng pamilya
Sa inyo ang ginhawa
Sa anak ang biyaya.
("This is Responsible Parenthood
Plan your family
For you, there will be comfort
For the children, blessing")
Taken from the Responsible Parenthood Program of the Philippine Center for Population and Development.
Organizing a Song-Writing Contest
A song-writing contest is an effective culminating activity. This way, you can also assess whether the participants have absorbed the messages or lessons you wanted to impart.
Mechanics:
1. Divide the participants into groups of three.
2. Ask them to think of a melody they already know, and to write lyrics based on a particular topic in population (e.g., ideal number of children). For those who are more creative, they can compose their own melody to suit the lyrics.
3. You can then ask each group to sing their song.
4. The participants themselves can agree on the criteria for the best song. These criteria can include:
- originality
- correctness of ideas/concepts
5. You may invite somebody who is good in song-writing to be a judge in the contest.
6. During community programs, encourage the winners to sing their songs as entertainment numbers.
Story-telling Sessions
* Small community gatherings lend themselves well to story telling/reading sessions, where lessons in population education can be incorporated.
* Most villages have skilled storytellers. These are usually old folks who have much experience to share. We can tap these folks, or we can make our own folk-tales which incorporate moral lessons in responsible parenthood, gender-sensitivity and environmental conservation.
Figure
Organizing a Story-telling Session
If you have already organized a study group, story-telling can be a method to introduce a concept or lesson.
Sample questions:
1. What happened to the mother/father? Why?
2. What happened to the children? Why?
3. If you were in the parents' place, what would you have done?
The Story of Dolores
Dolores Perez was nineteen years old when she married Delfin. (A picture of Dolores shows she is a pretty girl).
In the same year, she gave birth to Daisy.
Then, she gave birth to Carmela, Tony, Carlos, Maria, Emma, Cynthia and Jose.... eight children in eight years of marriage.
Carlos did not even reach his third birthday when he fell ill and died.
And this is Dolores now. (A picture of Dolores shows that she is now haggard and looks much older than her real age).
How many more women are like Dolores who do not know that a two-year spacing between births is necessary to ensure the health of both mother and child?
Field Visits
* Nothing is more convincing than seeing a success story with your own eyes and interviewing the people who made success possible.
* Community members can visit nearby villages who have successfully launched a development program or any project related to responsible parenthood/ population.
* Taking out the participants from their day-to-day environment will help in broadening their knowledge. The field visits can also provide a respite to the participants from their heavy work load.
* It would be helpful to prepare guide questions for the participants. This way, all the information needed can be gathered during the trip so that there is no overlapping of activities.
Figure
Poster Making
* Poster-making contests on specific population themes can be organized Since the contestants will need to know more about the theme, they will be forced to do research on it
* Posters will have multiplier effects since there will be many who will read the messages
Figure
Puppet Shows
* This is another method that appears to work well with younger audiences.
* Puppets can be made from recycled materials like old socks, brown paper bags and plastic disposable cups.
* Community members can be trained to make the puppets and to draw up the script
Figure
How to Make Low-Cost Puppets
Materials needed: old socks or brown paper bags, crayons/felt tip pens
Directions:
1. Fit the sock or brown paper bag into your hand so you can mark where the eyes, ears, nose, etc. will be.
2. Draw the face of the character you want to show on the sock/brown paper bag using crayons/felt tip pen. You can improve on the appearance like putting yarn for the hair, etc.
3. Since these are hand puppets, you can design your show in such a way that only the faces of the puppets are seen.
4. You can also make full figures from old clothes/socks and other materials that you can recycle. If you have pillows that are no longer used, you can use the pillow stuffing to fill up the puppet. Then you can attach strings at the arms and legs to make the puppets move.
Folk Drama
* This method works well with big crowds especially during community festivals or celebrations.
* Community members can be trained to re-enact true-to-life stories related to population, environment, women and development.
* The group members identify a problem and enact a skit or play on it in the presence of others. It is then discussed with the audience to stimulate further analysis, reflection and action.
* Simple and low-cost props and costumes can be designed. The community members can even take part in the development of the script.
Figure
Organizing a Folk Drama
1. First, decide on your message/s. What concepts would you want to put across in the folk drama?
2. Draw up the script, or ask somebody to do it.
3. Select the cast of characters.
4. Practice drama with characters either as a group interacting, or as individual characters.
Development Theater/Role Plays
* This is a simplified version of the folk drama/theater. This requires little or even no props, and no costumes, unlike the folk drama.
* Performances can be set anywhere. Often, community members can even serve as props (i.e., if a chair is needed, one community member poses as a chair and provides suggestive behavior).
Figure
Adaptation of Common Games
* Games provide good opportunities for mixing physical and mental activities in one method. The following are examples of games that have been adapted to community use:
- Rumor Clinic (a version of message relay)
- Tic -tac -toe
- Snakes and Ladders
- Family Feud
A complete description of how each game is conducted is found in the Appendix B.
Figure
Quiz Shows
* This method works best among representatives of community groups.
* You can organize the quiz shows together with other facilitators, or in coordination with existing organizations in the community (e.g., Community Development Council).
Figure
Organizing a Population and Development Quiz Show
1. Select your contestants. They can either be individuals or teams, depending on your preference.
2. The quiz show is best scheduled to coincide with an activity in the village (e.g., village fiesta, end of harvest season, etc.)
3. In the actual show, the person/group that signifies to answer the question first is called first. If the answer is wrong, the other group/contestant will be given the chance to answer the question.
4. The group/contestant who correctly answers the most number of questions wins the contest.
Below are samples of questions and answers:
1. What is the best or ideal number of years between pregnancies? 2 years.
2. At what ages should pregnancy be discouraged among women? below 18 and above 35 years of age.
3. A pregnant mother should have a tetanus toxoid vaccine.
4. The first outflow of milk from the mother, which is yellowish and sticky, should be given to the baby. True or False.
5. Children who have diarrhea should not be fed. True or False.
Use of audio-visual materials like slide-tape presentation/movies
* Slide-tape-presentations and movies can be used in areas where there is electricity or where a small generator is available.
* Most movies/slide-tape presentations have already built-in messages in the story.
* Appendix D shows slide-tape presentations/movies that can be used for community education programmes.
Group Discussions
* Group discussions are effective means of clarifying and weighing the pros and cons of a problem or an issue.
* The atmosphere for discussion should be conducive for expressing one's thoughts/ ideas to maximize the outputs of group discussions.
* The facilitator should see to it that the guidelines on group discussion are used to provide a logical and progressive framework for developing the courses.
Figure
Conducting Group Discussions
1. Prepare an introduction to guide you at first. A facilitator who is confused or lacking in self-confidence will not hold the attention of the participants.
2. Clarify with the participants the objectives of the discussion.
3. Create a friendly atmosphere for frank discussion.
4. Let each person have a chance to speak. See to it that the request to speak is signified, and that you, in turn, acknowledge the person before he/she can speak.
5. Encourage the timid to join in, but politely restrain the most talkative.
6. Take care that the discussion does not become a dialogue between two members.
7. Do not let technical jargon go unchecked. Always simplify or explain terms which may be unfamiliar.
8. Prepare questions to steer the discussion. If the subject runs dry, or people stray from the point, it is time to bring out those questions.
9. Do not argue with the group. You are not an opponent but a mediator.
10. Make a summary/synthesis of what has been discussed and if possible, display this for all to see and endorse.

Setting Learning
Reviewing the Technology for Designing Population Education Activities
Setting Learning
* It is important that for each population education session, the learning objectives should be clear.
* We can follow the guidelines below in setting learning objectives:
Learning objectives must be:
Specific
Measurable
Acceptable
Realistic
Time-bound
S - pecific
We must be clear about the change we want to achieve. Action words must be used to describe the desired outcome in terms of what the learner should be able to do as a result of learning.
Examples:
* At the end of the 30-minute exercise, the participants shall be able to enumerate the effects of rapid population growth on the availability of rural resources such as fuel and water.
* After the group discussion, the participants must be able to explain the importance of giving production loans to women even without the consent of their husbands.
M - easurable
The changes in knowledge, attitudes and skills must be easily seen and determined.
The post-test scores of women on management of rural resources must show a significant change in knowledge before and after an education program has been conducted.
A - acceptable
The behavior, attitude or knowledge expected of the participants must be culturally acceptable.
Example:
In some Muslim countries such as in Southern Philippines and parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, and in Roman Catholic communities, the use of contraceptives such as the pill for family planning is not acceptable. Therefore, this may not be accepted as a valid objective.
R - ealistic
The reaming objectives can be achieved.
It is useless, for instance, to set an objective where rural women, after attending some sessions in food preservation (and where the concept of responsible parenthood was discussed), are expected to discuss comprehensively the effects of population growth on rural transmigration.
The objective is simply not realistic because there were no adequate inputs for the women!
T - ime bound
The time for the objective to be achieved must be stated.
Sample reaming objective:
By the end of the one-hour session, the participants shall be able to explain the advantages/disadvantages of using a condom for family planning.
"If you are not certain of where you are going, you may very well end somewhere else (and not even know it!)"
<section>7</section>
Module 6 - Review and evaluation
Why should we evaluate?
What methods can we use for evaluating the sessions?
Module 6 - Review and evaluation
Purpose:
* This module discusses the importance of evaluating the NFPE activities and provides guidelines for such a purpose.
Why should we evaluate?
* We need to know whether we have met our learning objectives.
Figure
* We need to identify our strengths and weaknesses. For example, we might be strong in the methods, but our content might not be as comprehensive.
Figure
What methods can we use for evaluating the sessions?
* Action- Reflection -Action Sessions
- Participants are asked to share their observations/insights on the methods and content of the sessions, including the performance of the training staff/resource persons.
- These can be informal, free-for-all sessions that can be conducted among groups with not more than 20 participants.
* Visual Expressions
- Sometimes, our participants are too shy to express their feelings.
- We can ask them to draw their feelings or reactions to the NFPE activities.
- They can either draw how they feel or use flash cards prepared for this purpose.
- Below are examples of drawings expressing how one feels:
Figure
Pre-post tests
* Simple testing, like selecting prepared drawings showing certain concepts, can be administered before and after some sessions.
* The participants should correct the tests themselves so they can funkier learn in the process.
The above are just sample evaluation methods. You can use all your creativity to devise more appropriate and participatory methods in evaluating the NFPE activities.
Figure
Games
* The use of games can be an effective evaluation method. If we want to check on the knowledge of the participants, we can have variations of such games as:
* TIC-TAG-TOE
A correct answer entitles the participants to a mark on the board, until they can make a straight line. It looks like this:
Figure
* FAMILY FEUD
The winning participants are the ones who give the highest number of correct answers. The participants vie to be first in giving the most number of correct answers. Example of question:
- What C can be used to prevent the spread of AIDS virus?
Answer: Condom
* RUMOR CLINIC
-The group that gets the correct message first wins the contest.
In conducting games as an evaluation method, it is important that the answers are discussed. We should also ask the participants who gave incorrect answers the reasons for their responses. This way, we will know if there were some shortcomings in the way we handlled the learning process.
N.B. Facilitators my find some useful hints on conducting games in Appendix B.

Appendices
Appendix A - Preparing support materials
Preparing Support Materials for Non-Formal Population Education
Generally, the intensive and diversified use of support materials for the non formal population education is crucial in view of the adverse realities, some of which arc given below:
* Almost one third of the world's adult population cannot read and write.
* Women compose 60% of this population and the number is increasing.
* It is important to reach out to this non-reading, non-writing women population because they are precisely the vulnerable group and are most in need of population education.
There is an old Chinese adage which goes:
IF I HEAR IT, I FORGET IT
IF I SEE IT, I REMEMBER IT
IF I DO IT, I KNOW IT.
* Unfortunately, not all of our teaching methods and our resources will be able to cater to the "on the job" training type of education. For bigger audiences and for wider reach, we need to have group teaching methods that rely heavily on the use of visual support materials.
* There are various types of visual support materials that have been proven effective in population education. These materials include flip charts, flash cards, leaflets, comic books and magazines. Lately, there has been much use for visuals silk-screened in rough chambray or cheesecloth
Advantages/Disadvantages of Each Type of Visual Support Material
In selecting the type of visual support materials for our NFPE activities, it would be helpful to know the strengths, as well as the limits, of the materials we arc planning to use:
* Flip Charts
Advantages:
+ Convenient to use because the concepts needed to be explained are already prepared.
+ Drawings can be put together so that they can be arranged in the order the topic will be discussed.
+ Flip charts made from cloth have been found to be of popular use because they can be folded or rolled and can be easily carried. Unlike chants made of cartolina or cardboard/illustration board, flip charts made from cloth do not get easily damaged when wet.
Figure
Limitations:
- Flip charts can only be used for an audience of not more than 25 persons. Otherwise, these will not be seen? especially by those located far from where the charts are shown.
- Since the illustrations in the charts do not show much movement and have to be simplified for visual impact, there is still the need for an effective verbal enrichment/explanation of the concepts presented.
* Flash Cards
Advantages:
+ Flash cards are easy to carry. More concepts can be introduced in several cards which can show progress or movements.
+ They can be easily developed, and the audience can even participate in making some of the cants.
Limitations:
- Flash cards can only be used for smaller groups of not more than 15 persons. However, they are best used for home visits or for face-to-face sessions.
- The smaller size of the flash cards somehow diminishes the impact of the presentation and is not as dramatic as, say, the flip chart.
Figure
* Leaflets
Advantages:
+ Messages can reach a larger number of people, limited only by the supply of leaflets and the people who will do the distribution. This has multiplier effect because the material can be passed on to others after the first set of audience has studied them.
+ The readers get to retain their copy of the messages which they can review when needed. In some instances, the leaflets are even used as wall posters, as a constant reminder of what needs to be done. This is specially useful when using such contraceptives as the pill because the mother gets a constant reminder that she should take the contraceptive.
Limitations:
- No matter how well-illustrated the leaflets are, the audience must still know how to read because not all the messages can be contained in the illustrations. This limits the audience to those who are literate, unless somebody can read the literature to them.
- Producing leaflets would entail a bigger amount of initial expenses for printing and even for conceptual development. The smaller the print run, the more expensive is each individual copy.
Figure
* Comics
Advantages:
+ This is a favorite form of entertainment in the rural areas, where the audience is already familiar with the comics.
+ This can be distributed to as big an audience as the budget would allow.
+ More messages can be incorporated in story form. The material can be read by the audience over and over again and can be passed on to others who are interested, or who may need to read them.
Figure
Limitations:
- Comics entail more funds than the preparation of the leaflets. A skilled artist and writer should develop the concepts in population education in such a way that they not look like they are forced within the story.
- The audience is limited to those who have a medium level of literacy. That is, their reading skills are not as developed as, say, someone who has gone through four years of elementary education.
Figure
TIPS IN PREPARING VISUAL MATERIALS
* Layout
- Visual aids must be easily legible. If there are letterings to be done, they must at least be two inches in height if they are to be easily seen by the audience. it is difficult to read this........
Figure 1
Figure 2
THIS IS CLEAR AND EASY TO READ
Figure
- The visual aid must be clean and neat.
Figure
- Present one message for every illustration.
Figure
- Limit the number of concepts/pages for each material so as not to bore/overload the audience.
Figure
- Leave plenty of white space so that the material can be easily understood and will not look crowded.
Figure
- Arrange messages in sequence that is most logical to the audience. We should consider that people usually read from left to right and from top to bottom.
Figure
- Use illustration to supplement text.
Figure
* Illustrations
- Use familiar images or representations. People can easily understand and associate things that are familiar to them.
Figure
- Use simple line drawings so that the audience will not be distracted from the main message.
Figure
- Use a positive approach. Negative approaches might be discouraging.
Figure
- As much as possible, make illustrations that encourage analytical skills and allow discovery.
Figure
Appendix B - Some common games
SOME COMMON GAMES THAT CAN BE USED FOR NON-FORMAL POPULATION EDUCATION
1. Rumor Clinic
* Before starting the game, decide on the messages that you want to relay. The following are sample messages:
- Breastfeeding is best for your baby.
- Small families, happy families.
- Women power, people power.
You can make your own messages which are suited or relevant to the conditions of your area/audience.
* Ask the participants to form 3 lines of around 10 persons each. Select a Game Watcher for each line.
* The message is whispered by the Game Watcher to the person in front of the line. The person in front then whispers the message to the next to her or him, and so on, until this reaches the person at the end of the line. The latter then runs forward and whispers the message to the Game Watcher. The first group who gives the correct message gets 1 point.
* The group who gets the most number of points win the game.
2. Tic- Tac - Toe
* Materials needed:
Blackboard
Chalk
Questions in index card
* Divide the participants into 2 groups. One group will take the "X" sign, while the other will take the "O" sign.
* Draw the diagram below on the board, big enough for everybody to see.
Figure
* From a set of prepared questions, draw one question at a time.
Example:
What is the ideal number of children per family?
The group who answers "2" (the correct answer) first gets to put their sign on the board.
If the answer given by the first group is wrong, the second group is given the chance to answer the question.
If both answers are wrong, the Game Master gives the right answer with some explanation, and goes to the next question.
* The first group who draws a straight line using their sign (examples shown below), wins the game.
Figure
3. Snakes and Ladders
* Materials needed:
Game board
Dice
Marker
* The object of this game is to reach a designated point on the board, which represents success.
* You can make a board out of a cardboard folder or cartolina as shown below:
Figure
* You can divide the participants into groups of 5. Each group shall be given a gameboard, a die, and one marker for each participant.
* The participants take turns in rolling the die.
* Beginning in the spaced marked "start", the player counts the spaces shown in the die. If the player falls on a "positive" space, he or she advances. Positive spaces are those which show desirable values. For example, if the marker falls on a space which shows women and men helping each other do the housework, the player advances to some spaces, or gets another turn in rolling die. "Negative" space are those which show undesirable values, such as women not included in community meetings. If the player falls in the space, he or she either goes back some spaces, or loses a turn.
* The first player to reach the "ideal place" or the goal, wins.
4. Family Feud
* Materials needed:
Brown paper/kraft paper
Blackboard
Chalk or marker pens
Questions (to mark on kraft paper) on index cards
* The object of the game is for a team to win as many points as possible.
* The participants shall be divided into two-groups. Each group will select a leader.
* On the board, or brown paper, you can draw a figure showing the first letters of the answers to the questions. The first letters can themselves form a message as shown below:
* The Game Master can start with the first letter and ask:
What "W" is said by the Chinese to "hold half the sky?"
Answer: Women
* Then he or she goes to the next letter:
What "O" prevents dehydration?
Answer Oresol (or oral rehydration solution)
* The Game Master goes on until he or she completes all the letters.
* In case the players cannot answer the question, and the Game Master has to give the answer, he must have a back-up question(s) for the same letter.
* It should be noted that in cases where the participants do not know the answer, the Game Master should provide more details regarding the correct answer. In this way, the participants are further educated.
5. The fertility game
Materials:
* Questions
* Stock of cards showing contraceptive method, and corresponding points
Instructions:
* Divide the participants into 2 groups
* Ask them to line up.
* The 2 in front will be asked a question. For example: What contraceptive method is contraindicated for women who have heart problems? Answer: pills
* The first one who gives the correct answer will be asked to draw a card. Each card will have a corresponding point, with the explanation:
- Pills - If taken appropriately, this has a 97% effectiveness. You score 5 points.
- Billings' method - This method may not be as reliable because changes in body secretion are sometimes not discerned rightly. You score 2 points.
* After the participants in front of the line have finished with their turn, they move to the back of the line.
* Each group will then total the number of points that they have made.
* The group with the most number of points wins the game.
* The facilitator will make a synthesis of the session by relating the use of more effective family planning methods to peace of mind, to less number of children, and eventually to the improvement of the quality of life of the family.

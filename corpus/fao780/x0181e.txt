<section>1</section>
Introduction
Introduction
Nearly 10 years have transpired since the conclusion of what the UN referred to as "the decade of the woman" (1975-1985). The world has lived and experienced great changes such as the end of communism in East Europe. Many Latin American and Caribbean countries which were repressed during the heavy economic crisis the famous lost decade (1980-1990) began adjustment policies and have been gradually resuming a rhythm of sustained economic growth. The South-East Asian nations, which precede the Region in regard to their economic development, are characterized, among other things, by having a sustained investment in education and training in their towns, a strategy which CEPAL also supports from the perspective of ''equal productive transformation."
In this world of accelerated and varied changes, what is happening to women? The patriarchal relationship standard between men and women that has marked the most cultures on the planet is being questioned and, in fact, has been mitigated in many regions. What is happening in Latin America and the Caribbean? Moreover, what is occurring in the lives of rural women in the Region?
As it was described years ago^1, a society organized on patriarchal standards is characterized by a hierarchy division of roles and tasks for men and women. Men occupy and lead the public arena, or work and politics; women are engaged in the private world related to domestic life which is oppressed by masculine dominance. The deep roots of Latin America and the Caribbean are, without a doubt, patriarchal. However, in modern times, scientifically speaking, this confirmation is not novel nor does it bear any substantial contribution. The progression of this knowledge requires more complex visions, visions that are keen, precise and which demonstrate the feminine complexity in maintaining patriarchal order. Above all, these visions must identify changes and progress, eventual weaknesses or reinforcements of what Basil Bernstein denominates as the "classification'' between the sexes. Latin America and the Caribbean is patriarchal, although not as it was 50 years ago.
^1 For example, please see, "Feminist frameworks"
Work and family life in rural areas of Latin America and the Caribbean are permeated with patriarchal standards; however, it has also suffered the influx of modernization such as technology and the media.
This work attempts to outline the situation of women living in rural areas of Latin America and the Caribbean; the progress they have achieved; and their still pending challenges. These studies were conducted with an awareness of the important forum to be held during the World Conference Regarding Women in Beijing '95 and the fact that it will constitute a milestone and new horizons for the people and institutions concerned with improving women's conditions as a whole.
The Region is vast and includes over 60 million rural women (1990). Furthermore, it bears quite a blend of cultures, ethnic groups, economic development levels and political conditions. Likewise, each country has its own heterogeneity. This work, for its general tenure, does not pretend to reflect precisely what is occurring in each country, nor could it thoroughly exhaust each of the subjects to be considered.
The main purpose of this document is to provide fundamental ideas in a global perspective which will lead to comparisons of what occurs in other regions throughout the world thereby serving as an instrument in orienting future research and the design of policies.
This is a study based on Regional bibliographic information available at international entities, such as research centers and documentation, therefore representing its strengths and limits. Vast amounts of information have been reviewed finally selecting the most homogenous and reliable sources. However, the true reality goes beyond this research. The vision contributed by the international bodies and research centers constitutes "one" perspective of reality, however meticulous and valid it may be. Many changes occur on a daily basis in rural sectors; such changes have not been researched and there is no available information in this regard.
This document attempts to respond to various questions. The first, which comprises the first chapter, is a question of context. It seems logical that before speaking of rural women, one must profile their varied walks of life and the Region's rural development. The life of a woman occurs in context and depends on it. For example, the incorporation of women into the work force at varying degrees cannot be explained by the prevailing cultural standards at any given moment, it must also consider the growth and unemployment levels in a specific economy.
The second question reflects an awareness of the diversity of the studied reality. Rural women are multifaceted: they are housewives, but they also work, whether on their own farm or not. These women are rich and poor, old and young, literate and illiterate, natives and indigenous, they speak all languages and dialects. To put it all together, "the rural woman" is an abstraction, a useful concept rather than a reality. Chapter Two aims to provide, backed by statistics, knowledge of their manifold variety and to unveil certain forms of "invisibility" which result from a patriarchal culture applied to women on the farms.
Chapter Three responds to questions concerning rural women's education and their access to formal education, training and technology. Formal education is frequently a requirement when seeking paid employment and being involved in decision-making processes in their community and country. Usually, it is considered as a necessary requirement although this does not suffice to advance the condition of women.
The Family is what many consider to be the natural locus for women. It is, without a doubt, a primary dimension in the life of the majority of women. In Chapter Four, through analyzing marriage, family types and fertility, an attempt is made to provide a panorama of some of the features and trends inherent in rural families today.
One main concern in the analysis of the gender perspective is the relationship between the access women have to power and the impact of the same in their own lives and society. Control and power exercised by men in light of the deep, patriarchal roots characterizing Latin America and the Caribbean have established barriers blocking feminine involvement in decision-making processes within different types of organizations linked with industrial and community affairs. Chapter Five responds concerns regarding the measure of how rural women have overcome barriers posed by masculine power, as well as their being involved in decision making concerning industrial and community activities.
The Law, by nature, applies to all citizens of a country. Legal discriminations affect all women, independent of the fact that they may be rural or urban. However, Chapter Six entails those legal provisions linked more specifically to women's lives on the farm. The Chapter also proposes some matters related to the institutions bearing an active concern for the progress of the feminine condition.
In Chapter Seven, reference is made to the environment and some milestones, partly generated by a patriarchal culture, regarding the role of rural women in environmental care.
To facilitate reading, each chapter includes its own tables, conclusions and recommendations. At the end of this document, general conclusions are presented as well as the bibliography.

Chapter 1 : Context in which rural women are living
1.1 Magnitude of rural population in the Region
The evolution of the rural population^2 in Latin America and the Caribbean is characterized by a continual decrease regarding total population: in 1930, nearly 70% of the population lived in rural areas and in 1990 close to 30% of the Latin Americans lived in rural areas (Graph 1). In absolute terms, of the approximate 440 million inhabitants of the Region, 124 million live in rural areas (J. Chackiel and M. Villa, 1992).
^2 The definition of the "rural" towns, is not homogenous in all countries. The differentiation between rural and urban considers aspects such as total population, main grouping significance or the proportion of the population depending on agriculture. This implies that the rural population is defined as that group which inhabits rural areas and should not be considered as synonimous with the agricultural population (Macció, 1985).
The proportion of rural population varies according to each country. In Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Paraguay, the rural population comprises the majority, and in Haiti this number reaches 70%. In countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela, rural population equals less than 16%. (See Table 1 and Graph 2).
Changes in economic activities of Latin America and the Caribbean and the subsequent urbanization process established the favoring of non agricultural activities. Two macroeconomic indicators of this are the composition of the Economically Active Population (E.A.P.) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per sector.
In regard to the makeup of the E.A.P., workers in the agricultural sector are no longer the majority. In 1950, 55% of the employed dedicated to agricultural activities; whereas at the end of the '80's, this percentage decreased to 25%. The decrease in the agricultural E.A.P. did not affect its internal composition in terms of a modern, farming sector; the first representing around 40% of the total (PREALC, 1991).
The GDP presented a similar behavior: between 1950 and 1980 the average annual growth rate of the non agricultural GDP, exceeded agricultural growth; 5.8% and 3.5%, respectively.
There are differences among the Region's countries regarding the contribution of agricultural activities to the GDP, and the percentage of the E.A.P. in the agricultural sector.

Regarding the GDP, available information for 12 countries indicates that the contribution from the agricultural sector is greater in Paraguay (31.0%), Guatemala (23.3%), Costa Rica (19.6%) and the Dominican Republic (18.2%) and lower percentages are seen in Chile (8.4%) and in Venezuela (4.6%). In the remaining countries, percentages vary between 11% and 15%. Such information indicates, likewise, the importance of the utilities sector in all countries (excepting Cuba) (Table 2, Graph 3).
In reference to the total E.A.P. composition per productive sector, it is observed that these same countries demonstrate significant differences: in Guatemala and Paraguay, nearly half its E.A.P. is dedicated to agricultural activities (these two countries enjoy the greatest GDP contribution from the agricultural sector) while in Venezuela and Uruguay, this figure dose not exceed 16%. The population employed in the agriculture sector represents 40% of the Peru's E.A.P. and 32.7% in Ecuador. For the other countries, statistics stand between 20% and 28%. With the exception of Guatemala, Paraguay and Peru, in the other countries, nearly half or more of their E.A.P. are devoted to the service sector (Table 3, Graph 4).
The urbanization process in Latin America and the Caribbean resulting from the development styles assumed by the different countries, established a trend towards concentrating the population in areas that possess political-administrative service centers and consumption spaces. This is related to the deteriorating living conditions in the country, and above all to the unequal distribution of the excess produced in the farming area, thereby generating the exodus of large population contingents to the cities.
For its part, pressure in large urban centers brought into play the fact that the social policies favored people living in urban areas. This favoritism of urban over rural is discussed in a document which synthesizes case studies, centered on rural communities in five countries comprising the majority of the urban Region population (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela). Such document indicates that rural districts would have, generally, a marked tendency towards city ordinance. Furthermore, its functions are basically assistance-oriented on attention and social benefits levels for residents, and not on promoting productive activities in rural areas. The fostering tasks for agriculture production have traditionally been assumed by the central government, in which the communities enjoy marginal involvement (FAO, 1993a), except in Chile's case³.
³ Chile presents a different situation. The analysis of the resource distribution between urban and rural sectors, within the 20 rural communities in the Region VIII, there was 65.2% of resources destined to rural sector projects. In this light, it is stated that "without delving into the precise use and destination of these investment projects, the objective fact confirms that relatively speaking the sectors that are rural within the analyzed communities are favored.. (FAO, 1993b:100).

1.2 The "lost decade" and structural adjustment processes
During the so-called "lost decade", all economic sectors were severely affected, but relatively speaking, the agricultural sector was the least affected. In fact, although both the agricultural and non-agricultural PDG decreased, the average annual growth rate of agricultural GDP between 1980 and 1989 was 2.1% while the nonagricultural GDP was practically half (1.1%) (PREALC, 1991). In fact, the decreasing trend of total GDP contribution experienced in the agricultural sector in previous decades was reversed between 1981 and 1989.
This relative "least poor" position of the agricultural sector compared to the rest of-the economic sectors observed during the "lost decade" was interpreted differently. One interpretation (CEPAL, 1992) indicates that quantitative indicators would confirm the traditional function of agriculture as a support rather than a motor to improve economic growth and its capacity to cushion macroeconomic disturbances and preserve resources so as to maintain growth during depressed periods in virtue of the inertia of that sector. This would correspond to the basis referred to as traditional agriculture which for its own rationality complies with that "traditional function" since it places its resources to production services when faced with crises situations with work dynamics that do not correspond to the economic criteria of the modern businesses which strive to accumulate capital.
Also, it has been said that, undoubtedly, important progress has been made for some products in those countries where it was possible to expand nontraditional exports (tropical fruits and those from temperate climates, vegetables, flowers, soy bean) (J. Chackiel and M. Villa, 1992:41). In this regard, others (Gurrieri, 1994) refer to this phenomenon as the "green revolution" which produced a true transformation in Latin American agriculture regarding production growth and productivity. The authors refer to modern agriculture, medium or large scale, which was developed based on land concentration, its richness, income and the mass migration of the agricultural population to cities.
Likewise, the relative most favorable behavior in the agricultural sector may be indirectly related to the adjustment policies that eliminated some bias towards the sector resulting from strategies assigning priority to the industrialization. Also, devaluation and less food imports to the Region generated spaces to reactivate production and stimulate agricultural exports, thereby compensating the negative effects of the adjustments (such as the reduction in public expense) better than other sectors (IDB, 1990).
Beginning in 1991, a clear improvement was registered in the Region's general economic situation but agricultural contribution to this improvement was irregular. In fact, the large increases in the economic activity were produced in oil-exporting countries benefiting from a temporary peak in 1990/1991. Results in those countries with greater agricultural orientation were unequal. Clearly, the increases in the GDP in Chile, Ecuador and El Salvador were largely due to agriculture. However, the drop in the agricultural production was partly responsible for the decrease in Costa Rica's GDP and for the effective production decrease in Haiti. Economic contribution from agricultural exports was also unequal. The preliminary 1991 data indicates that income derived from agricultural exports may have decreased slightly in relation to 1990 (FAO, 1992a).
The future behavior of the agricultural sector is a subject that has not yet been sufficiently praised. The opening process and the structural adjustment which have been imposed in Latin American and Caribbean countries, for as far as a balance could be made, have suffered from a fundamental error: human conditions have not been taken into consideration, including their specific aspects in the productive and cultural areas which have established the gaps between the reality and the proposed objectives. The key to the adjustment measures is in perfect consonance with the achievement of economic profitability; profitability in traditional agriculture's is known as one having connotations of high human level content regarding resources and family needs.
The exchange policies, duties and stimulus for export trade are tending to elevate profitability of companies producing exportable agricultural goods, particularly nontraditional tropical and subtropical products (CEPAL, 1992).
Another area which poses interesting profitability levels comprises the fruits of a temperate climate following its opposite production season conducted in the northern hemisphere, the diversification of vegetable production and some extraction of renewable forestry and fishery resources. Sources which have suffered more in terms of future profitability are observed in grain, dairy and meat exports (CEPAL, 1992).
1.3 Poverty and neglect in rural zones
From the point of view of the income and access to basic services, it is assumed that better living conditions prevail in urban areas. If this assumption is correct and is associated to the privilege awarded to urban areas regarding social policies, it hides the fact that, in both the rural and urban areas there are insufficient living conditions and extensive poverty. The inhabitants of the "ghettos", "favelas" (Brazilian ghettos), shanty towns, "cantegrilles", etc., may even have worse living conditions than rural residents. The Regional UN Project for overcoming poverty estimated that there were 270 million poverty stricken Latin Americans, which is to say, nearly 62% of the population.*
In fact, poverty in absolute terms is situated in urban areas given the style of population concentration typical to Latin American and Caribbean countries. From this point of view, there are more poor people in urban areas than in rural areas. Relatively speaking, it is considered that 30% of the Latin American population lives in rural areas, which helps to comprehend the true magnitude of rural poverty as a problem when in 1989 more than half of the total rural population was living in poverty and almost one third of them were destitute.
* See .UNDP. Regional Project for Overcoming Poverty. Development without Poverty, 1990.
In one study, the magnitude of the poverty in the Region was analyzed for the '80's (CEPAL, 1991). When comparing poverty in Latin America between 1970 and late 1980, a difference is observed with respect to 1970: poverty is actually primarily associated with the urban sector, a product of urbanization and increased poverty levels concentrated in those areas, particularly during the crises. While in 1970 only 37% of the poor resided in urban areas, by the end of the 1980's, more than half (57%) were in the cities. However, when observing the situation of the extremely poor or destitute in the Region, it was found that, although the portion of the urban population within the total destitute grew from 31% to 45%, just as in 1970, the majority of the Region 'e destitute resided in rural areas.
Poverty levels within rural and urban areas, in turn, experienced an inverse process for the same period; homes considered as poor within urban areas increased from 26% to 54%. Homes of the destitute within the urban areas rose from 10% to 12%; while in the rural areas a slight decrease was observed from 34% to 31%. In 1989, 43% of the poor inhabitants of the Region were rural thereby leading to the affirmation that rural poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean is decreasing. The rural destitute in 1989 numbered over 60% of the rural poor.
According to the same study, these global figures are associated with the virtual stoppage of the level of product per capita in the Region between 1970 and 1989 which, excluding Brazil only rose 3.2% in real figures. The level reached in 1989 is less, exceeding 12%, than that achieved in 1980. The majority of this low resulting from the crisis was accompanied by reductions rather than a larger income ratio of the poorest areas. These circumstances would explain the increase of total poverty and essentially urban poverty. Such figures lean towards ideas of decreased rural poverty, apparently, in any case, given that the income per capita is a global variable which obscures Latin American agricultural dynamics inasmuch as the product generated is the result of the consolidation of a capital-technology intensive modern agriculture in large scale and medium size units which did not accompany living condition improvements of the rural dwellers. This produced income in such a way
that the fastest increase in per capita income was obtained in rural areas compared to urban areas over the last two decades. This tendency wee stressed in the '80's when the value added to agricultural aspects - per rural inhabitant- grew close to 14% while that generated from non-agriculture activities decreased in a similar percentage (IDB: Agricultural Peak in Latin America", Bulletin from Inter American Bank of Development, 1989, CEPAL, 1991).
These trends indicate a) that poverty in rural areas is proportionately higher than in urban areas; and b) that the majority of the Region's destitute live in rural areas. The 1989 estimates reveal this situation, as shown in Table 4.
Among the reasons that cause poverty and disregard among rural area dwellers, the access to and ownership of land is considered. Even though agrarian reforms have been made in the majority of the Regional countries, generally it has not been sufficient to provoke substantial changes in the ownership structure since Latin America is the Region presenting the largest concentration of land ownership (FAO, 1993c).

* Estimates based on figures calculated for 1986 in 19 countries of the Region.
In this regard, upon analyzing the results from the agrarian reform processes conducted in Latin America from 1917 to 1980 in 13 countries, León, Prieto and Salazar (1987) state that only Mexico, Cuba, Bolivia, Peru and Nicaragua produced substantial changes in the distribution of land ownership. Efforts in other countries were less in this sense, also favoring individual ownership forms which, at times, were accompanied by diverse cooperatives (Table 5). It must be indicated that this figure (75%) contains those rural people who do not own land and those with small farms yet they require larger areas for their survival.
The portion of rural dwellers without land is undoubtedly very high. In effect, according to FAO estimates (1987), such individuals constitute between 15% and 39% of dwellings in Latin America and the Caribbean (León, Prieto and Salazar, 1987:5). Now, CEPAL/CELADE (1993) estimate that "75% of the rural families in the Region do not have land available or suffer from acute scarcity of the same, thereby obliging family members to spread out and work away from their own farm in order to subside. This does not always occur under conditions that safeguard minimum income and well being." (Pg. 50).
It should be noted that the significant difference between the above-quoted estimates reveal the difficulty in determining how many of the rural area residents do not possess land in these countries, and this subject has been frequently mentioned.
Together with the difficulties of accessing land ownership, a large portion of the population in rural areas is currently distributed on small-size settlements with a high geographic dispersion. Reduction in lot sizes has been increasing in the majority of the Regional countries, fundamentally associated with poor farmers. According to recent estimates provided by FAO (1987), in Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Peru the number of small farm units has increased by 50% during recent decades; yet surface area revealed only a 38% increase, thereby generating a decrease in the average size of the small farm (León, Prieto and Salazar, 1987).
Beyond limitations concerning access to land ownership and the size of the farms, it is evident that the mere feet of owning land does not suffice to ensure the well being of farming families. This is even more valid when put in the context of the enormous competition and market expansion in which the training for and management of new technologies are ever more necessary main factors for increasing agricultural productivity.

There is a large heterogeneity of productive forms among and within the distinct Regional countries. Chiboraga and Plaza (1993) indicate that productive forms in the agrarian sector of Latin America are different, among other manners, because of their productive social organization, production logistics, productive systems, the quantity and quality of resources, location of diverse agri-ecological and socioeconomic areas which determine the economic and social viability. Within the agricultural sector two different subsectors exist: one modern and the other farming^5. The differences between both subsectors originate not only from the resource quantity that they manage, but also from their productive logic and the type of articulation they have with global society.
^5 If this classification of agricultural in the region has had a traditionally accepted focus BID (1990) indicated that the crises of the '80's provoked profound changes in the social structure and the productive activity of the sector. The result is that currently there are three sectors coexisting in Latin America and the Caribbean: a) modern and technological production systems; b) medium size units and c) rural area economy , which would replace the traditional division between the modern and country sectors.
The modern subsector is organized by market logic and focuses target crops for urban consumption and exportation. Furthermore, it possesses the bulk of agricultural credit, the use of supplies and modern techniques, the majority of irrigated land and both the physical and institutional infrastructure. This sector is composed of small and medium size farmers and large agricultural and livestock activities organized under company management.
The majority of the farming and small-size producer's sector is situated in areas lacking physical and social infrastructure. Some are independent small farmers, others are organized by a type of collective ownership (rural communal land, common land) that is associated with or which depend on, in some manner, estates and large properties. They are characterized by little credit access and production is mainly based on meeting family needs. The land they possess is scarce, fragmented and disperse, a considerable portion of which is under precarious ownership conditions.
1.4 Conclusions
The agriculture of Latin America and the Caribbean is very different from what it was 50 years ago, having experienced very dramatic changes over the last few decades, which are reflected in the figures referring to the magnitude of rural populations in the countries, to the agricultural activities contribution to GDP, and regarding the importance agricultural EAP has for the total EAP.
The trend in the continent is that the rural population is decreasing; however, some countries continue being very rural. The Regional population currently is predominantly urban and the urbanization process has had, to a certain degree, a peculiarity: due to the manner in which it has been conducted, it has worn down rural life and imposed urban life styles on rural sectors.
Poverty is one of the stigmas of the Region: in rural areas it not only has increased in absolute terms, but also has degraded the proportion of destitute exceed by 60% those living in poverty. More than 54% of the rural dwellers live in poverty.
Access to and land ownership have been expressed as one of the causes for rural poverty and some redistribution policies would contribute to its decreasing. However, today, there is general consensus with respect to the fact that land ownership access alone does not ensure the economic well being of the families living in the country. In this light, it has been demonstrated that the policy design focused on redistributing land ownership must consider training programs, technology transfer, credit and marketing thereby enabling the country dwellers to continually improve their production profitability.
Regional agriculture has three perfectly defined distinct facets; one large, modern and developed; the other, medium, modern with technology; and the other traditional, rural and generally poor. All of the aforementioned are large goods producers for the food product market and for agroindustry. The differences among those sectors do not only arise from the quantity of resources that they manage, but also from their productive logic and their articulation with global society which together determine their economic and social viability.
During the crises and the so-called "lost decade" (19801990), when faced with severe GDP decreases in all economic sectors, the agricultural sector decreased in less proportion. On one hand, the so-called modern agriculture with technology, achieved significant progress, particularly in the production areas for nontraditional exports. On the other hand, the country's agriculture, due to its individual productive logic and articulation with society, was constituted as a means to cushion the crises, incorporating more work to its farms, expanding whenever possible - the working surface area and often decreasing their benefits.
Beginning in 1991, the crises was beginning to wind down and an improvement was seen in the macro-variables of the Region. The agricultural sector of the different countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have presented different responses to the adjustment measures, according to the type of prevailing agriculture - modern or traditional - and according to the rural-farming population ratio. However, the adjustment policies that have been implemented gradually in the Region have been eliminating the prejudice towards the agricultural sector and have generated spaces which enabled reactivation of agricultural production and exports.
The Latin America and the Caribbean Region presents the largest concentration of land ownership in the world. Despite having exercised agrarian reforms in this century in nearly all of the Regional countries, specifically beginning in 1965, there is still a high rate of rural dwellers who do not own land or who have very little land. Likewise, the land distribution is very unfair, and the largest part of the very small farms prevail with a high geographic dispersion and with a growing tendency towards reducing farm sizes. Similarly, access to training programs, new technology and credit is also unequal. Such aspects are considered as a strategic point to face the problem of rural poverty.
On a production level, in an attempt to pose a future estimate for agriculture in the Region, adequate levels are envisioned for production profitability of exportable agriculture goods, particularly tropical and subtropical nontraditional products, the production of fruits and vegetables from temperate climates and the extraction of renewable natural forestry resources and fishery. On another level, due to the amount of rural population which duplicates the traditional rural production example in Latin America and Caribbean, if land distribution, training, recovery and incorporation of technology of high social control policies are not severely applied, the living conditions of this sector will not only remain as they are, but poverty conditions to which the majority of the population is subject will gradually become more acute.

Chapter 2: Women's entry to productive sectors in a rural environment
Latin America and the Caribbean, as mentioned previously, is characterized by a heterogeneous productive structure. Women are involved socially and economically in this structure in different manners, areas and productive and reproductive roles within the family. For this reason, it seems more appropriate rather than referring to "rural women" as an abstract identity, to talk about "women in rural areas" who are farm owners, paid workers, in varying degrees of dependency, whether they are lessees, seasonal workers or employed in the agricultural industry as artisans, business women and, of course, mothers of their family.
Now, Regionally there still is a problem which was detected many years ago by those interested in gender studies. This is related to the difference between the environments assigned to women in their social role: their private environment, comprising their labor related to production and family reproduction; and the public, which is related to the environment through wages and social and political institutions. The first case frequently disregards or simply discriminates the productive contribution from women. In rural areas, the problem is much more complex due to the diversity of the tasks women perform, to the difficulty in differentiating daily productive activities, and to the bias generated in attaining truthful information (interviewer interviewee relationship). This information could influence criteria which later guides policy making which would be discriminatory and under estimates important records.
2.1 The "invisible work" of rural women
According to the IDB report (1990), generally speaking, in Latin America and the Caribbean, women are involved in almost all agricultural and livestock activities and there is also evidence that the rural E.A.P of the Region is becoming increasingly more feminine. To evidence this fact, it has been mentioned that a) the feminine, rural E.A.P. is underestimated by more than 50%; b) some estimates indicate that nearly 50% of the income in rural areas originates from activities performed by women thereby assisting many families in alleviating their poverty; and c) the results of diverse study cases evidence the different roles assumed by women in agricultural production.
However, the involvement of women in agricultural production in Latin America and the Caribbean has been, in general, underestimated, both for its scope as well as for the diverse forms in which it is manifested. It is common that statistics reflect only those productive activities responding to modern economic standards, whose basic indicator is compensation. The lack of statistics related to feminine work both within the home and farm, and for paid employment's in farming, traditional and modern agriculture, is a problem existing in all of the Regional countries. This phenomenon has been denominated by the '80's literature as the "invisible work" or the "invisibility of women."
The consideration of feminine labor is a topic of discussion in the quantification of unpaid family work. Rurally, the discussion is posed related to the duties of the housewife which are not limited to the biological reproductive and social roles of the workforce, rather she performs productive duties, that measurable or quantified within the agricultural economy product.
The registration of inferior levels of the productive economic activities of rural women is related as much to the criteria, instruments and measuring methods employed, as it is to the women'. perception of their own work.
Regarding the measuring instruments, in the case of the census and home surveys, due to the methods used in conducting them and general lack of adequate preparation of the interviewers and surveyors, information is omitted which would permit the true establishment of the magnitude and diversity of the economic involvement of women. For example, Karremans (1993), upon analyzing the feminine employment as a percentage of the total rural EAP for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua between 1970 and 1985, states that feminine agricultural EAP has remained constant in the Region throughout the entire period with the exception of Honduras. According to the author, this situation can only be explained by the use of inadequate instruments used to detect and represent the reality of rural women and men.
In addition to the deficiencies in the measuring tools, different official instruments often produce different figures. In Chile, for example, the feminine, rural EAP in 1982 was 10.8% according to the census of that year. For the same period, according to the National Employment Survey, it was 17.4% (Aranda, 1992:24).
By some methodology, the questions and answers are coded and both the interviewer and the interviewee omit the multiple activities which do not correspond to the traditional role of women; for example, the care of children and domestic duties. Therefore, the questions formulated for the census, home or employment surveys, geared to establishing the so-called "activities" of the woman (such as, what is your main activity?) lead to the answer of "housewife, "housework", "taking care of the home", etc. which ultimately classifies them as women in the ''economically inactive" category.
In an effort to approach this problem, a census conducted among indigenous groups in four rural districts in the south of Chile incorporated the question "What activity did you do last week?" the answer category ''took care of the house and worked", thus differentiating it from the "housewife" category. However, the analysis of the results revealed that women exclude activities such as taking care of fowl and smaller animals, agricultural activities and handicrafts that they perform and, in more than a few cases, these activities tend to be the exclusive responsibility of women (URFO/INE/FII/PAESMI/CELADE, 1990). The above indicates that it is not a simple matter of modifying information gathering tools, but suggests that research methods require fine tuning. In this regard, what Lanz and Valdivia (1990) proposed gains more relevance regarding the studies conducted with small farmers in Yaracuy (Venezuela): "...scientifically speaking, one of the greatest lessons we have
learned from the relationship with small farmers is that the traditional methods for research provide several limitations in attaining the truth ... the technical tools should be modified and more emphasis should be placed on observation techniques and on defining indicators that could be supplementary to the surveys given the wide range of errors which these introduce in the apprehension of knowledge."
The perception women have towards their productive work depends much on how and where they live. Their performance as an unpaid family worker or assistant without compensation is not usually acknowledged in their family or society thus making it very difficult that they acknowledge themselves. This is to say, we find ourselves faced with a vicious circle in which society does not define women as workers and neither do the women themselves. The way to break this circle assumes, before anything else, an awareness of the aforementioned: that women themselves be the first ones to assume and acknowledge their productivity.
In addition to the self-esteem that women have regarding their productive role and the deficiencies of the official measuring tools as factors related to the inferior registration of the productive activity of women in the Regional rural areas, a third factor must be added: when women work as paid employees - a matter which could be considered as an indicator for the EAP women employed temporarily per season tend to be considered employed, even if they were not working at the time of the survey. This also obstructs the measuring and acknowledgment of their own economic activity (Aranda 1992, Errázuriz 1987). FAO indicated an example of this: according to the most conservative statistics of the agricultural census, 19% of the women are involved in the agricultural work force in Latin America and 54% in the Caribbean. The differences do bear a relationship due to data collection methods: in the Caribbean, questions were asked for a six-month to one-year period while in the
rest of the Region, general speaking, questions were asked for the preceding week. ("Paraguay, Case Studies on Ojopoi: a country cooperative and repatriation: an area of an old decomposing settlement, 1983, CEPAL 1986).
Another factor to be considered in this explanation is that domestic and productive activities performed by women within rural societies have been historically developed without a clear, defined delimitation. The orientation towards self-consumption hinders even more the separation of economic activities from those that are truly domestic. An a result, rural women, a. the reproduction and survival foundation of the family, is divided between both types of tasks, attempting in any event to achieve optimum well being for their families.
In this framework, Errázuriz (1987) indicates that the work in the productive sector does not provoke conflicts between roles among women regarding how much or how well it is performed within the same physical space, meaning, without leaving her home. If she works away from her home as a temporary paid worker, she would tend, in many cases to accommodate her work periods, using the diverse options open to her that are still possible in the rural environment (due to the existence of certain family and community integration) such as leaving her children with other family members, older siblings or neighbors, when she cannot take them to her job. "The absence of conflict in the performance of her roles, gives way to less social consideration from the domestic and economic contribution of women along with the natural manner in which they are carried out which also diminishes its true meaning for the family" (pg. 219).
Now, this family and community integration tends to decrease as a result of economic and social dynamics (migrations to cities, lack of land for young couples, among others), and immediately the effect of this such conflicts appears in the domestic and productive role of the rural woman. In fact, one of the complaints indicated by a group of temporary assistant. in "rural women's schools" in Chile was to have nurseries for children at the work place (companies, fruit packing and vineyards) since many women are involved in these activities and the existing laws are not enforced or respected. Such law states that a work place should provide day care if 20 women or more are employed at the work site (Valdés 1992).
Errázuriz adds, however, another important element to understand the "invisibility" of productive activities within the home. She states that women favor their domestic role because it grants them identity and social position that does not depend on the economic power as a criteria for social differentiation. The role of the mother constitutes the only position in which she is irreplaceable. In effect, the author says that "...the domestic activities pertaining to women constitute a semi-autonomous system centered on family well-being which is controlled by women and constitutes a unique domain where women may exercise decision making powers legitimately and with greater self-determination" (p.222). According to the author, this explains why when a woman acquires new tasks thereby prolonging her work schedule, she does not stop doing her duties which are traditionally linked to her female role. It should be considered, though, that the addition to rural women's work shifts
usually stems from an economic decision and not a social one. The fact that she also executes the tasks socially assigned to her traditional feminine role does not always originate from the reason that she assumes those tasks because of her femininity, rather as a consequence of a matter of necessity.
There is a pending task in the majority of the Regional countries: the refinement of the instruments employed in economic activity measuring, generally census or national employment surveys, for which numerous studies in the gender area have produced recommendations. What is most needed is the political will to change the measuring tools and to familiarize the surveying team with the new procedures.
Refinement of measuring tools employed is a pending challenge in the majority of the Regional countries. Among the possible alternatives two deserve special attention: a) the incorporation into current employment or home surveys of specific items to be used in measuring women's productive activities in rural areas; and b) the carrying out of periodic studies particularly geared towards this goal. Of course, information provided from said studies would be fundamental in forming strategies destined to strengthening the entry of rural women to the productive, economic sectors of the Region.
2.2 Different types of feminine insertion to the economy in rural areas
The economic role assumed by women in rural areas is generally related to the family's survival strategies, either her own or the family she forms. A large number of women assume the role of an unpaid, uncompensated family worker or helper linked to the family farming production or her work in rural communities. In many cases, she is active in temporary or permanent paid employment in the fields dedicated to internal consumption or exports. Additionally, she may enter the informal economy as a salesperson or artisan.
According to the IDB report (1990) already mentioned, in Latin America and the Caribbean there generally exist evidences that the rural E.A.P. of the Region is becoming more feminine and that women assume different roles in agricultural production.
The feminization of rural employment would respond to the modernization of the agricultural and livestock activities, the impoverishment of the rural economy or a combination of both. On one hand, the demand for paid, manual labor for the agricultural production of marketable goods is easily obtained from men who respond by leaving the farm to the responsibility of his wife. On the other hand, the income deficit in rural homes motivates men to seek employment away from the family farm^6. Some of the main conclusions which are derived from national information and case studies indicated in said IDB report are:
a) that women are actively involved on the farm where the majority of foods for home consumption is produced. Women perform tasks related to seeding, fertilization, weeding, harvesting, threshing, animal care and forage collection.
b) that the decline in the sector's productive level has lead women to increase their participation in economic activities, as a survival means for their families. Their involvement is varied and depends on the family structure, the size of the lot, the type of crop, and the technology employed as well as cultural traditions.
^6 In BID's judgement, the non acknowledgment of this fact could explain the permanence of many problems of small farm exploitation. Additionally, it would hinder the design of successful policies: the population which tries to benefit is another, with different characteristics and needs, due to the organisation of the very small farms which has changed.
According to conventional measuring of female participation in the agricultural E.A.P., the number of women dedicated to agricultural activities has decreased: in 1950, 28.2% of the economically active women in the Region were devoted to agriculture; in 1980, 14.9% participated in this sector (IDB, 1990). This coincides with the total E.A.P. behavior and indicates a growing tendency of the population becoming more involved economically to other areas, particularly to the services sector.
Available information for 12 of the Region's countries brings to light diverse situations, the percent of women within the total agriculture E.A.P. and the feminine E.A.P. devoted to agriculture (Table 6) FLACSO-CHILE, 1993.
This same source, with regards to female involvement in total agricultural E.A.P., is relatively important in Brazil - 1988 - at 21.2%; Cuba, 1981 at 14.3%; Ecuador, 1990 at 12.7%; and Peru, 1981 at 15.1%. Women's involvement in the other eight countries stood at 10%.
Regarding the feminine, agricultural E.A.P., it was generally observed that when the manual labor of a country is strongly centered on agriculture, feminine E.A.P. in this field is greater. This is true in Peru, 26.1%, Ecuador, 15.8% and Guatemala 16.0%, where the total agricultural E.A.P. bears a significant weight (exceeding 30%). However, there are exceptions; for example, in Paraguay, almost one half of the total E.A.P. works in the agricultural sector (46.7%) yet only 12% of the feminine E.A.P. dedicates to said sector. Of the total agricultural E.A.P., women comprise only 5.1% (Table 6).
Regarding the type of occupation held by women, according to statistics from the ILO (International Labor Organization) (ILO, "Yearbook of Labor Statistics for 1988." in IDB 1990) the results are as follows: Latin America, 44.5% of women involved in agriculture work as "day workers", 32.5% as family help.. and 20.9% as "self-employed". This is to say, the majority of the Regional registered feminine E.A.P. earns a salary. However, this situation varies per area: in Tropical South America, the majority (53.7%) works helping the family; in Central America, 64.0% is self-employed; and in the Caribbean, 64.5% are day workers. In Temperate South America, the largest percent is observed in self-employed; workers (43.0%) (Table 7).
Regarding paid labor, according to Errázuriz (1987) the changes in the agricultural activity have provoked a reduction in the size of the farms and the value of the rural production, which has obliged the family work force to seek paid employment. Women have played an important role in this process and their proletariation represents the precariousness in which rural dwellers live: the poor, rural families are becoming increasingly dependent upon the woman's income.
To the author, these reasons explain the significance of the presence of paid labor, particularly in those areas requiring intense temporary/seasonal labor and in those areas specialized in agro-industry. Mentioning diverse sources, the author indicated that in Colombia, women now comprise 70% of the flower crop work force; in Mexico, 60% of the strawberry production employment is performed by women; in Honduras, 40% of the work force for tobacco is feminine; in Jamaica, 52% of the workers in the banana fields are women.
In Chile, women make up close to 52% of the seasonal fruit-growing workforce. Basically, the tasks required in this field are manual and, given the belief that women perform this type of work better and are more thorough than men, hiring preference goes to women (Veldés, 1992). However, it has been estimated that women comprise 5% of the permanent fruit-growing staff (Rodríguez and Venegas 1990: "From prairies to vineyards: a study on agrarian structure and the labor market in the Aconcagua Valley, Aranda, 1992).

Paid labor in agricultural industries has been performed by many women over recent years. In fact, the majority of the studies indicate that these companies have generated employment for feminine manual labor. It has also been observed that there is great diversity among the countries regarding the working conditions, even though they share some aspects: wage discrimination, lack of social security and other benefits. The seasonaleness of the work and the women's weak organization (CEPAL 1990a) would also contribute. In this regard, Díaz (1992) in a case study conducted in Chile's central valley, stated that of 44 temporary workers in the agriculture industry who participated in the study, only 21 signed a contract for the period prior to the study.
In reference to wage earning rural women, generally in all of the Regional countries, they received salaries which were inferior to men's salaries. In Bolivia, for example, the cane companies hire men to cut the cane, while women and children are left to de point, peel and pile the product. These employees are known as "fourths" since the women received one-fourth of what men receive (FAO, 1991b).
Wage differences, a constant factor in Regional agricultural industries, do not seem to apply in Chile. Venegas ("The fruit related labor market in Chile. Final report (unedited), Venegas, 1992") proposed that there is no wage discrimination against temporary employees in the fruit-growing business: in the major fruit-growing regions, seasonal female workers earn more per hour worked than men. According to the author, the sex factor does not mark the main difference, rather the occupational position and the type of work. In this same sense, estimates from the National Employment Survey of Chile, October-December, 1992, indicate that women who work for themselves in "agriculture, hunting and fishing'' earn more than men placed in the same category: her average income represents 127.3% of the average male income. However, considering salaried workers, women's average income represents 85.3% of men's average income. (IINE, 1994).
Trade is another economic activity carried out by women in rural areas. A study conducted in Honduran district (Denen, 1993) showed that trade activities follow the same logic as the division of productive work: women process a good part of the agricultural or livestock products in or around the house, where, at times, she has a small sales point installed. The income of these women equals over one third of the total income generated by the total sales of farm products. However, there are imbalances between men and women: sales with greater monetary value are made by men; they sell and purchase both on and off the farm. Women sell smaller items, yet they conduct more transactions although it is within a more restricted working radius.
When referring to the productive work of women, the production of domestic goods and services should not be forgotten; these also go unnoticed and is subject to "invisibility. since they do not figure in national accounts." This invisibility has long been evidenced in -tender studies. It should be highlighted that whatever the productive activity of rural women, said activity runs parallel to the performance of domestic work which, in the majority of the cases, is conducted under conditions demanding a considerable amount of time and physical effort since they do not have modern appliances, such as washing machines, gee stoves, etc. This implies that women develop a "double. or "triple work day". In this regard, Grunfeld (1990), when referring to rural women in Southern Chile, indicated that domestic teaks, such as water hauling, clothes washing and cooking, require a great amount of time and effort, in addition to wearing them down sad hindering their devotion to other
activities, whether economic, cultural, political, social, recreational, or others.
2.3 Women's access to land and credit
The access women have to land and credit is considered a fundamental element for the performance of productive efforts under the same conditions that men enjoy. However, in the majority of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, this access is limited and is directly related to the low productivity of feminine agricultural work, specifically on small farms (IDB, 1990). The restriction in land and credit access is basically due to cultural and legal factors.
In a cultural environment, it is observed that, generally, women define themselves as generators and reproducers of goofs and services in domestic activities while men are responsible for production. This impedes that women be conceived as beneficiaries of productive programs. In fact, the majority of such programs are geared towards men, while social programs for home improvement are to women (León, Prieto Salazar, 1987). The aforementioned indicates that cultural barriers exist within the same organizations that plan, manage and design programs and policies. Undoubtedly, this contributes to the disregard of women and systematically underestimate their productive role in rural areas of the Region, a matter which has already been discussed.
Cultural barriers influencing programs and project managers are also in rural areas in base organizations, as well as in families, couples and even in the women themselves. Therefore, the existing barriers in the planning entities and in the rural population are mutually reinforced, many times to the point where women do not acknowledge themselves as potential beneficiaries to land or credit access programs.
The scarce access that women have to land and credit is also related to the existence of a series of legal discriminatory provisions^7. To this must be added the fact that the majority of the countries present a gap between the legislation and its application in the rural sector. This often leads to customs overruling the laws, hence reinforcing the subordination of women (FAO, 1990a).
^7 For further explanation of these legal discriminatory dispositions see 7.1 "Legislation and Rural Women.
In reference to land access, it has been observed that agrarian reform policies have discriminated against women. In some countries, even legal provisions constitute an obstacle. When there are no such legal obstacles, frequently tradition and poor feminine organization pose barriers (FAO, 1992b). Generally, there is a tendency to define the beneficiary as the "head of the house" understanding that person is in fact a man. This does not acknowledge the existence of homes lead by women nor the woman's right to participate jointly with their husbands.
Explicitly, in Cuba and Nicaragua women have benefitted from agrarian reforms, countries where rural women's participation is defined in national policies (FAO, 1989). However, in Nicaragua, the majority of women have been indirectly benefitted through cooperatives. Direct access that women have to land has been very reduced: in 1984 only 8% of the direct beneficiaries were women thereby revealing contradictory legal provisions. If the Agrarian Reform Act acknowledges equality among men and women, it also establishes that ownership rights should be issued to the name of the claimant and not the family which leads to the fact that ownership titles have been awarded to men. Furthermore, although the Cooperative Law proposes to support women's involvement through their integration in economic and social management of the cooperatives, it does not grant legal inheritance rights to the husband's widow (Nicaragua, 1993).
The limited access women have to credit is part of a more general problem that tends to affect small farm producers. In fact, the experiences of credit for rural people, for example in Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay and Ecuador, verify that women have been good administrators and that they payback their debt (FAO, 1992b). Despite the fact that they represent a lower risk than men to financial institutions, since their rate of return in general is higher, banks and credit institutions are hesitant to grant them credit due to the fact that "...they do not own property which may be offered as guarantees. In general, they request small amounts and usually lack experience in credit activity" (FAO, 1989:95).
Diverse farming and women's organizations have demanded access to land and credit and below are various national examples. A survey conducted on 25 representatives of the National Committee of Rural and Indigenous Women of Colombia yielded that almost all of them admitted that their lack of land ownership proves to be an obstacle in obtaining credits and technical assistance. The first would be because they do not have a mortgageable property; the second, because of their "non-owners" status, they are excluded from the design of technical assistance programs (León, Prieto and Salazar, 1987).
In Guatemala, the Coordinator of Small and Medium Manufacturers, CONAMPRO, proposed at its First National Rural Convention (1992) that granting land to women who could not access credit should become a priority. However, the Mayan Guatemala Organizations Counsel, COMG, incorporates women as land beneficiaries through their family group (Arias Foundation/Tierra Viva, 1993).
In Peru, the district associations for rural women created in Puno in 1982 which extended to Junin and Piura, have demanded land and credit, as well as other grievances. In Brazil, the presence of rural women wee indispensable at the large assemblies for the agrarian reform during the 1985-1988 period (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993. Volumes correspond to each country).
In the Dominican Republic, the Feminine Minimum program created on the framework of the 1990 elections by the Research Center for Feminine Action, CIPAF, contemplated the right to land for rural women as one of their demands (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993. Dominican Republic).
In Paraguay, the Coordination of Rural Women, CMC, an internal entity of the Paraguayan Rural Movement was created in 1985 proposing the access to land as one of their demands. (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Paraguay).
As can be observed, the demands for rural women to access land and credit are included in rural organizations, thus forming general grievances from the farming arena, as well as in expressly feminine organizations.
2.4 Conclusions and recommendations
Women are diversely inserted in social and economic affairs in the rural areas of Latin America and the Caribbean for which, instead of speaking of the "rural woman" a more precise manner would be to refer to them as "women who live in rural areas."
The available information shows that one problem has been detected and maintained over many years through gender studies. Actually, the woman's economic involvement in rural areas of the Region have been, and still is, systematically underestimated both for its scope and diverse expressions. This problem also present in urban areas regarding domestic tasks, has lead to the creation of the concept of ''invisible work" or the "woman's invisibility". In rural areas, this gains a particular strength since the productive and domestic activities do not tend to be differentiated from a practice, evaluation or objective standpoint. This is unaffected by whether or not such activities are conducted on or beyond the farm, thereby causing difficulties in quantifying the generation of benefits, monetary and non-monetary incomes or savings through consumption and sales of goods and/or services.
Regarding the low registration of feminine work in rural areas, it has been detected that official elements intervene regarding the criteria employed; measuring methods and instruments that are coded which omit relevant information and often the lack of awareness on the part of the woman regarding her productive value and roles. These three aspects determine what is known as the viscous circle'. of such types of recording inferior figures.
Based on conventional statistics, which is to say those records where low registration is detected, and following the general Regional trend, between 1950 and 1980 the feminine E.A.P. was observed to be less each year for those women dedicated to agricultural activities.
Recent available data for some Regional countries reveal diverse situations: percentages of the feminine, agricultural E.A.P. vary from 26.1% in Peru to 2.5% in Venezuela. These percentages may imply that the proportion of women involved in agriculture continues the general trend in the country which is generally greater in those countries with a higher agricultural E.A.P. However, it is difficult to pronounce the logic of the figures until the problem of the inferior registration has been conquered.
The participation of women in the total agricultural E.A.P. is also heterogenous. The highest involvement (between 15% and 20%) appears in Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador and Peru. A share below 10% occurs in Costa Rica, Chile, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela.
It also verifies that the rural E.A.P. is becoming more feminine which responds to modernization in agriculture and livestock activities and to the rural income deficit which would compel the man to leave the family farm to become a paid worker. When this occurs, women take charge of the farm, particularly the small farms, where most of the food for domestic consumption is produced. If we consider the production of rural women on and off the farm, their contributions to savings begin with their own production for consumption, domestic activities or the sale of goods and services we may confirm that a very relevant part of the family income is generated by women.
Women participate in all agricultural and livestock activities and play various economic roles: many are dedicated to non-compensated housework; some are paid either temporarily or permanently in agriculture for national consumption or for exports; while others are traveling traders and artisans in the informal sector of the economy.
In reference to the type of their occupations, OIT estimations for 1988 indicate that Regionally 32.5% of the women help in the home, 20.9% are self-employed and 44.5% are day workers.
Considering OIT's figures, paid labor is one of the most important economic activities performed by rural women. In recent years, her participation has acquired growing importance in agriculture industries which have generated employment basically for women.
In agricultural areas where there are seasonal, employment peak periods for the industry, the paid work of women has intensified representing 70% of the work force of the flower crops in Colombia, 60% of the strawberry production employment in Mexico, 40% of the tobacco work force in Honduras and 52% of the banana workers in Jamaica. In Chile, women comprise 52% of the temporary work force in fruit growing; however, they represent 5% of the permanent workers.
Generally, in all countries women are subject to wage discrimination, a lack of social security and other benefits even though there are some exceptions, such as Chile, where temporary female workers in the fruit-growing industry earn more per hour than do men.
Trade is another activity developed by women and basically consists of selling product produced by themselves. The earnings generated by this activity represent an important part of the total family income. There are differences regarding the type of trade conducted by men and by women: women tend to sell minor goods thereby conducting a greater number of transactions within a limited radius with sales bearing less monetary value than those sales conducted by men.
Women perform all of the above jobs simultaneously with their domestic functions which demand a great amount of time and energy, often translating into a double or triple work shift. Unlike urban women, domestic jobs are performed with fewer appliances to facilitate work.
Cultural and legal barriers limit women' a access to their basic needs for strengthening their productive activities; in other words, land ownership and credit. This is associated with the low feminine work productivity especially on small farms. Basically the problem lies on the non acknowledgment of women as producers which is a conception often shared by program and project designers as well as the financial institutions.
Culture is sanctioned by legal discriminatory norms toward women which is added to the large unawareness existing in the country regarding legislation which many times is replaced by habit. In fact, the majority of the agrarian reform policies applied in different countries of the Region have defined the beneficiary as the "head of the houses" which is understood that such a role is actually played by a man. This perspective ignores the presence of feminine household heads and the right of married women to a shared participation. Cuba and Nicaragua are the exceptions, although contradictory information is available.
The difficulties presented in this chapter are basically cultural meaning that the form in which individuals and institutions understand reality is marked by concepts and codes which do not correspond to the rate of changes. In order to overcome the cultural and legal barriers and the problem of inferior recording of feminine productive work, supplementary, systematic and constant lines of actions are required in two environments:
- making the public and private entities which intervene in measuring, planning or execution of programs in the rural areas aware of the gender perspective;
- making the women themselves aware. of their productive roles. This point is further discussed in the chapter referring to education. Suffice to indicate at this time that the basic labor is to lead to mass awareness and invoke this train of thought from infancy through formal education.
Of course, it is not enough to make the different social participants aware of the gender perspective. Problems such as poverty, land and credit access are shared by women and men in the rural areas of each country. What seems to be important is that rural women be a part of the social organizations of the country, with the authority to participate and, apart from supporting global grievances, and that they be able to defend their roles as women.

Chapter 3: Education, training and access to technology
3.1 Coverage and education levels per zone, age and gender
Regional education has demonstrated increasing expansion since the '50's which is reflected in a marked reduction, generation after generation, in the lack of formal education in society. However, this expansion has responded to a set of complex pressures which translate into an example of unequal distribution of the benefits in the educational system. This distribution is characterized by social segmentation of education, a growing rural-urban imbalance, and less relative access for women.
Towards 1980, one-third of the people over 45 years old were classified as "bearing no education" while only slightly more than 10% of the population between 15 and 19 years old were placed in the same category (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992).
The analysis of the totally illiterate confirms the same: extending to 15% of the population over 15 years of age in the Region in 1990 and particularly within those older than 43^8 (Graph 5). The largest part of illiteracy in the elder age group is a common factor in all of the sub-regions, as illustrated in Table 8 (Unesco/OREALC, 1992).
^8 In Unesco/OREALC, 1992, totally illiteracy is defined as those classified as such in the population census.
In the majority of the Regional countries, urban population possess higher education levels than those in rural areas. Recent available information for some of the countries in the Region reveal that in all countries illiteracy in the rural areas is double or more than that in urban areas (Table 9, Graph 6). Feminine illiteracy follows this same trend; that is, illiteracy is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. There is a difference of almost 5 percentage points in Uruguay reaching 31 percentage points in Guatemala (Graph 7).
In the rural population, women generally obtain an inferior education than do men. The rural, feminine illiteracy rates in the Regional countries fluctuated between 19.2% and 48% in 1985 (CEPAL/CELADE 1993:57). This situation is worse in Peru where the difference between men and women is nearly 35 percentage points. Costa Rica, with almost no difference and Brazil, where the rural masculine illiteracy rate is greater than the feminine one by approximately 3 percentage points (Graph 8), are the exceptions to this tendency.

Upon comparing rural and urban area differences regarding feminine illiteracy and illiteracy among men and women within the rural areas, results were found that for the countries analyzed, the first are significantly higher than the second (Graph 9). This indicates that most likely the lack of education in rural women is more related to their geographical location rather than their being women, a conclusion which is quite important from a gender perspective.
Although it may be true that for some time rural parents considered that education for their daughters was unnecessary, the indicated figures seem to show that today both parents acknowledge that children, both sons and daughters, should be educated thereby generating more opportunities for girls than their mothers had. For example, this is demonstrated among Bolivian and Peruvian rural inhabitants. The Bolivians additionally stated that: "Current generations have an improved standard of living because women are educated", "Our life is better because we are treated better and we go to school, therefore we are better informed and know more things" (14-18 year old age group), (FAO 1991:33). As for the Peruvians, they add a new element: teachers: "the least prepared are sent, they are "third category" teachers" (FAO 1991c:23). Other indicators referred to below are not as clear in this regard revealing that still men are favored over women.
Educational levels of rural women result as being lower than those of men due to the rural migration which is predominantly feminine: in effect, migrating women are younger and generally represent higher education levels than other rural women. Leaving the countryside produces a breach in educational levels in these areas, thereby increasing illiteracy and decreasing teaching levels.
Unfortunately, there is no recent information regarding the differences per age groups concerning educational levels attained by rural women in the Region. The Unesco yearbooks, which is supposedly the most authorized source in this subject, do not provide such information. In the literature which was revised to create this document, no recent works were found in this regard.

An analysis of the census of the '80's, (CELADE, 1987), showed that instruction levels attained (years of study approved or passed) are generally lower in rural areas, women and the elderly. To be fully aware of the recent makeup in the Region, we must wait for the analysis of the '90's. However, surely the difference per age will not present important changes: they are related to the educational policies applied in the Regional countries which have affected various generations. Still, it will take many decades to minimize their effects. For this reason, the lack of education is greater when global indicators are taken into consideration for the analysis. This could lead to confusion by interpreting them as the product of actions currently taken. Furthermore, the higher education levels attained by young women favors the success of training and technology transfer programs which would lead to situations of their becoming priority recipients of these programs.
Lack of education among the elderly is frequently observed in the rural areas of the Region as well as in the indigenous communities of various countries (Hernández, "Ethnic Conscience and Adult Education for the Indigenous in Latin America, 1984, UFRO/INE/FII/PAESMI/CELADE, 1990). A census of indigenous groups conducted in four rural districts of Chile reveals that illiteracy is greater among older people, both men and women^9. Feminine illiteracy is higher than masculine (60% of the total illiteracy rate is comprised of women) and the difference per gender becomes relevant starting at 25 years of age. Among the younger ages, illiteracy rates are even slightly lower among women thus indicating greater incorporation of these women to the educational system (Table 10). Regarding school levels, men between 5 and 29 years of age have an average of 4.9 years of approved studies, while women in the same age group have a slightly lower average, 4.7 years. The differences are
greater related to the population over 30 years of age: men have an average of 3.8 years, while women bear an average of 2.6 years (UFRO/INE/FII/PAESMI/CELADE, 1990).
^9 The illiterate population is defined as that which has not approved any course in the educational system.

The quantitative expansion in the Region during the 1950's occurred mainly in primary school which became obligatory and free in all of the Regional countries (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992). However, it must be remembered that, even though educational coverage has increased in rural areas, "In all countries bearing information, schooling of about 50% or more of the rural youths reaches barely 6 years of primary school or less" (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992). Additionally, juvenile illiteracy in the Region (15-24 years old) is a predominantly rural occurrence. Recent statistics indicate that the average illiteracy rate in these groups was 31.1% in rural areas and 7.6% in urban areas (Unesco/FAO, 1988). Likewise, course failure in rural areas was, in some cases, double than that of urban areas. This influences schooling delay which is not attributable only to failing, but also to delayed enrollment to school common in rural areas (Rama: "Educational Styles" in "Education and society in Latin
America and the Caribbean", Unesco/CEPAL/UNDP/UNICEF, 1980, in Unesco/FAO, 1988). The actual meaning of these figures should be interpreted through a comparison to developed countries where finishing high school requires at least 12 years of schooling which has become practically universal.
3.2 Rural education quality
The fact that there is an ever-increasing number of rural youths entering the educational system does not mean they receive an adequate education for their developing requirements. Teaching quality is a problem existing in and beyond the cities; however, this is stressed in rural areas due to the following factors:
a) the obligatory curriculum of primary school is designed in the cities and the urban criteria prevails; the latter being inadequate for rural children, they confuse them and make them feel uprooted from their rural living. The difficulty of the fact that studies are in Spanish constitute another factor that limits access to children of indigenous communities which bear a limited or void knowledge of Spanish;
b) the incompatibility of school vacations and peak periods for manual labor in the country thus contributing to temporary absence and poor educational results;
c) the poor preparation of the teachers: the portion of unlicensed teachers tends to level at one third and 50% than the national average;
d) the simultaneous education of various grades without proper teacher preparation in this regard; and
e) the detachment of the teachers from the community since they frequently do not live in the community as a result of transportation improvements (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992).
All of the above points towards the fact that the core problem would not only linked to having access to education, rather its quality and the possibilities of remaining in the school system.
Attempts to resolve these problems have been more oriented towards quantitative expansion of the education in rural areas than in creating and offering an education pertaining to rural living. Furthermore, instruction and class modifications rarely have been evaluated and systematically diffused (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992).
Delving deeper into these qualitative aspects, FAO (1991a) analyzed the education in the rural sectors of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela indicating that the quality of the educational services in rural areas of these countries is quite poor and that men and women enjoy distinct conditions and opportunities.
In Bolivia, the feminine school abandonment is higher than men's and the informal educational programs for rural women tend to reinforce their domestic role (cooking, sewing, etc.) In Peru educational differences between men and women in rural areas are crossed due to cultural factors: the lack of resources cause the parents to favor the sons with education. A similar situation occurs in Ecuador where it is believed that the education provided does not coincide with or is not useful for country living.
Despite the fact that the women in the Region enjoy more educational opportunities than did their mothers, school texts used in primary school continue to transmit images highlighting women's roles at home, thereby underestimating their participation in other functions. Studies conducted in Chile, Costa Rica and Guatemala demonstrated the preeminence of masculine characters and images that associate men to productive activities and women to domestic activities. Over recent years, the Costa Rican government has made efforts to mitigate this situation (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992).
Although the effects of teachers transmitting stereotype gender roles through teaching (Rossetti and collaborators, 1994) have not been studied in the rural environment, there is no reason to assume that teachers could be more fair in the country than in the city. On the contrary, it should be also considered that what occurs in rural areas also happens in the cities, and that teachers reinforce stereotypes through their teaching methods and mannerisms in dealing with their boys and girls in the classroom.
3.3 Rural education and employment
The influence of education in employment opportunities is another topic of interest when analyzing the extent of educational coverage. Valdés (1992) upon studying three life stories of women in central Chile indicated that agrarian and social modernization would increasingly influence children and adolescents through the schooling system, prolonging the age of infancy, distinguishing and separating learning experiences collected with adults within rural families from the school education. She also states that attaining higher education does not seem to lead to better jobs since market conditions do not offer better employment opportunities to youths who attained a higher education than their parents.
This proposal agrees with that from CEPAL-CELADE where it is indicated that the educational influence on the growing social movability seems to be decreasing: "Upon widening educational coverage, increasing demands regarding necessary schooling have been observed; the above, so that education would imply better employment options and a better living" (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).
Despite the formal education limitations which have already been mentioned and that impede education to be the most adequate instruction for productive living in rural areas, education has been proposed to increase agricultural productivity through three potential effects: a) improving the work quality thus yielding more production with the same amount of supplies; b) improving the capability of the producer to process information and allocate resources for competitive uses; and c) improving supply selection in the short term and operating scales in the long term. In this framework, various studies indicate that productivity improves up to 7% or more if the farmer has passed four years of primary school.
These four years have been defined as the "minimum" necessary beginning. However, the incorporation of new technologies require large capacity in reading and writing, as well as mathematics (the four basics, ratios, percentages and the rule of three) which begin being acquired starting in the fourth grade at school and which should be studied in more detail after the sixth grade. Therefore, it may be affirmed that although the three or four years of primary education (considered sufficient for literacy) may act as catalysts, accelerating entrance in the first phases of technological changes, higher education is required to increase technological development (CEPAL/Unesco, 1992). In this regard, increased formal education becomes a requirement to adequately incorporate and manage new technologies.
Regarding rural women, the above implies the necessity to make efforts to extend their formal education, but more to guarantee their remaining in the educational system and overcoming the stereotypes taught through the teaching practices and learning texts. Then they should focus on favoring their development as women and particularly the success of the technology transfer programs.
As will be seen later, to date, in rural areas greater innovative efforts regarding gender have been made in training, which is part of the adult education and therefore necessarily restricted. What bears the most impact for mass, profound changes in the hierarchy and division of the sexes has not been considered; meaning what could enrich course studies and teaching practices of the formal education system throughout its different levels in view of equal opportunities between men and women. This would imply that before anything else, teachers of both sexes who work in rural primary and secondary schools should be made aware of this element.
Efforts in the formal system, even if they are delayed in their execution, are advantageous in achieving greater impact and being more permanent.
3.4 Training and technology
Generally, literature referring to the access that rural women have to training and technology indicates that such access is restricted. The " invisibility" of the productive work she does perform - due to the fact that she is not paid for it, as analyzed earlier - could constitute an exclusion factor regarding women's training. For some reason, it is assumed that since she in not paid, the rural female does not work; and given the fact that she does not work, therefore no training program is required (CEPAL 1990a).
This vision of limiting women to domestic-reproductive roles has also lead to their training being conceived in such a manner that reinforces their traditional feminine role. In these cases, training for rural women is basically oriented towards health aid activities, nutrition, environmental cleaning, home gardens, home improvement, sewing and handicrafts. Therefore, in this manner, women are taught to expect these types of projects and they will seek training to reinforce their domestic activities thus not developing their potential in productive projects in other productive areas.
However, in recent years productive projects have been developed for rural women in several countries in the Region (Aranda and Olavarría, 1988). This is not the moment to expound on all of them, although some of the projects are mentioned in Chapter 6. As one illustration, in Chile the program "Forming and Training Workshop for Rural Women" motivated by the government (INDAP-PRODEMU Agreement) which has been performed since 1992, conducted 304 courses in 1993; of which, 134 were related to agriculture and livestock (the majority of them were in reference to home gardens, greenhouses, fruit or vegetable processing and flower growing), 117 to handwork (sewing, knitting, cooking and baking), and 53 to handicrafts (weaving and wickering). Handwork represents nearly one third of all the courses; however it is important to indicate that these courses responded to the demands of women who still drag their experiences from the traditional Centers for Mothers which were not
questioned during the military government (Reyes et al., 1993).
In this regard, León's observation would apply which proposes that upon considering training, women think about those courses which are traditionally offered to them, creating a vicious circle: women are interested in traditional courses and the organizations and grantors foster this interest by not offering different alternatives.
An area where there has been much progress but until recently it was not systematically evaluated concerns the diffusion of alternative technologies for rural women. Regarding this subject, there seems to be scarce Regional information existing. Taking this into consideration, the UN Fund for Women (UNIFEM) created a directory of organizations working in this area in 1993 in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Nicaragua, based on research conducted two years before (UNIFEM, 1993). The directory provides 185 governmental and non-governmental organizations working in such countries: 32 in El Salvador, 50 in Guatemala, 47 in Mexico^10 and 56 in Nicaragua. Work areas are comprised of: a) agriculture (home gardens, organic fertilizers, compost and sutrane, minimum cultivation, biodigesters); b) stock breeding (manufacture of alternate foods); c) health (hygiene and nutrition, alternative medicine, drinking water processing) and d) food processing/micro-businesses (this line of
work is scarce and the majority of the projects relates to food production). Other programs include the breeding and fattening of animals (chickens and pigs) elaboration of sausages, sewing, knitting and assembly); e) housing (use of sun-dried brick, brick latrines, solar heaters, heaters (lorenas, Barneys and others); and f) forestry (forest management, oil extraction, forestry, reforestation).
^10 Only includes Non-Governmental Organizational
The list is vast, especially considering that it only covers 4 countries in the Region. Similar lists could certainly be formed in all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, recovering the experiences that abound starting from the '70's. The difficulties rests, without a doubt, on the fact that many of these initiatives are defined as action projects and do not count on the necessary resources to form and maintain a registry regarding achievements and results of the same.
The spreading of new technologies and their assimilation by the population is a subject discussed in the urban and rural environments. Regarding the rural areas, CEPAL (1990a) affirmed that the adoption of technological development in the agriculture and stock breeding sector has increased, in the majority of the countries, the polarization and heterogeneity of the productive structure. Although the incorporation of technology leads to be a greater control by the rural person of the technical conditions of the productive process, it has not been proven, in general terms, that poverty tends to be eliminated or decreased. One explanation is offered, alluding to Schajtman ("Country and Biotechnology. Notes to Reflect Upon. 1988), CEPAL poses that technology is not the "source of perversity" but rather economic and social conditions determine the lack of "neutrality" of the selection and technological adoption processes.
The incorporation of technology has also been discussed in relation to its effects on the work division between the sexes. In rural families it has been observed that they demonstrate flexibility when redefining labor divisions in crisis situations but then return to their traditional standards when such situations are overcome^11. (Ureta and Karremans, 1993). This is very similar to what Cock-burn detected ("Dominating Machinery: women, men and technical know-how, 1988, CEPAL 1990a) based on three case studies of industries in Great Britain. In general terms, the technological change does not affect the standard according to which men withhold knowledge and technical skills. However, technology incorporation provokes a commotion which implies a redistribution of tasks between men and women which ceases when everything has returned to normal. If this were so, CEPAL suggests that one should take advantage of the "commotion " moment to act on redistributing tasks between the
sexes.
^11 See 4.3. "Family and work division per gender".
Regarding the relation between technological incorporation and employment, to date the systematic effects are unknown as to the incorporation of new technologies in employment. Generally, manual labor production increases but the effects vary depending upon the type of technological change and the preexisting working conditions (CEPAL 1990a). Technological changes may have different effects on men and women. Joeckers ("Women and global economy., 1987, CEPAL 1990a) analyzed the situation of the developing countries and distinguished three levels of technological change which would be facilitating elements for incorporating it to work sites, particularly in the rural area: the improvement of the tools will accelerate the specialization process; mechanization overtakes manual labor and automatization increases the degree of participation, attention and preparation required by the work force. One example of this is the use of modern varieties of high-yield crops which generally
generate jobs as they incorporate other phases of work, among them, fertilization and land care.
Women could benefit from jobs generated by the incorporation of technology for two reasons: a) they represent, together with the youths, the only source of manual labor (particularly when there are low overall unemployment levels) and b) some activities requiring thoroughness and care, which demand, at the same time, much manual labor, specifically during the harvest, are classified as feminine work since agriculture follows the traditional standard of work division by gender. Furthermore, if men were to enter the agricultural industry, women would have to replace them in the farm.
Independent of the peculiarities of the processes of technology adoption in agriculture in Latin America and the Caribbean and the relationship between technology-generic division of the work and technology-employment, there is a consensus regarding the fact that training of rural women and the technical assistance programs can facilitate greater and better incorporation of women to production in different areas, a general increase of agricultural productivity and an improvement in the family socioeconomic conditions.
In this area, it should be asked to what degree are rural women willing to incorporate new technologies, considering their low educational levels and subordinate role to which they have been subject during hundreds of years. In fact, this question has been hardly developed. For example, in the Sub-Regional Workshops regarding the execution of the FAO Action Plan (FAO, 1992b), in the workshop conducted for South America, all the countries indicated as obstacles, although in varying degrees, the following: cultural barriers, scarce gender outline in public organizations and the lack of preparation of the officials, and legal and financial problems. Only one country, Chile, indicated an additional unsureness of rural women being interested in productive projects.
An example of the exclusion of women from training programs and technology access and the disregard of women's points of view, is found in some experiences in Peru (Alcántara, 1991). According to the author, in this country various energy projects have been developed (National Council of Energy, ITINTEC, Cajamarca University and DESCO) to use solar, heolic energy, biogas and hydroelectric energy, all in an experimental phase with limited scopes. No project included specific training for women. This is even more relevant when one considers that women directly use energy in their domestic and productive duties.
Another project, also conducted in Peru, INFOR/FAO/Government of Holland, trained to forest grantors as a means to motivate reforestation in some Andean communities in the sierra. Similar to the previously mentioned situation, these programs included a minimal participation of rural women. However, the same project considered a program of improved kitchens in two areas of the country (Huaraz and Huancayo) training the grantors to train women in some communities. In the eyes of the author these programs had "...a relative success due to construction costs yet with few efforts at convincing women to adopt these new kitchens" (op. cit. pg. 6). It is interesting to highlight this evaluation since it could lead to a questionable understanding: it could be said that the success of a technology transfer program lies in the capacity to convince the executors without considering the opinion and behavior of the beneficiaries.
In fact, considering the vision of rural women themselves regarding the training programs is a key element in the discussion regarding women's access to them. For example, research conducted by the Technology Transfer Program of the National Institute for Agriculture and Livestock Development (INDAP) in Chile (Olavarría, 1991) consulted the family grantors on, among other aspects, the demands of the beneficiaries. It was revealed that they were mainly centered on matters not related to agriculture such as material painting, knitting, cutting and assembly, cooking and baking. As an exception, in areas where there is or was some degree of organization, support to conduct activities that would contribute to women earning some type of monetary income was sought; such as the sales of some products (wood caving ovens to make bread, flower and vegetable growing in greenhousse).
To those offering the programs, this reveals that women do not wish to be trained in matters related to agricultural work. They believe that "they know everything about agriculture" or that they like to do things "their way". Furthermore, they are aware that many of the courses they demand do not contribute to their income but that they would like to be trained so as to have a better house or to knit for their family. In this same sense, it wee observed that they require training for matters that they already know how to do which represent an extension of their domestic role and whose main effect would be perhaps a "solid" activity so as to justify their leaving the home (Grunfeld, 1990).
The valuation of training courses centered on home improvement is not an exclusive rural phenomenon. Research conducted in industrial workers in Santiago, Chile, found the same opinions regarding training (Rosetti, 1984). This reveals the precarious insertion of the women in the working world for the urban and rural sectors.
In Olavarría's opinion, it is very likely that women 'e demands are influenced by the feminine stereotype linked exclusively to the maternal role which has been traditionally transmitted through programs aimed at rural women and which is systematically reinforced by the media. Therefore, Olavarría concludes that one should "...support the beneficiaries in defining their identity as women, as rural women, and in valuing their contribution to the family, production and society."
It is clear that programs should be designed to incorporate gender contents which allow the rural woman to redefine her role as a woman and producer, but it is fundamental to consider various elements when developing said programs. On one hand, the rationality of women themselves: their interest for training in areas linked to domestic duties does not only reflect a millenary lesson, perhaps it is also a sign of growing women, who do not wish to see themselves restricted exclusively to the working environment. In any event, forgetting such reasoning could become an important fact in the failure of a specific policy. In Colombia, for example, the contents of certain sexual educational courses oriented to rural women were considered by the same as strong thus provoking rejection from their families and the women themselves. Additionally, women even opposed to the creation of organizations with gender content as they considered the proposal of equality between the sexes as very
bold. (FAO, 1991d).
A second factor to consider is that before one can train women in nontraditional areas, a sustained awareness is required from the organisms which provide training and from the trainers as well so that they learn to better manage women's resistance to the change; a resistance that was fostered by the organizations themselves for decades.
Another important factor to consider is the magnitude of the activities developed by women and the time that they dedicate to them. The opinion of a female Andean leader is decisive: "Some initiatives for development, official or private, do not consider the excessive work of rural women and they add more work by believing that by improving the family situation they will improve women's life immediately" ("Andean Women", ISIS International, women's Editions No. 6. In Aranda and (Olavarría, 1988:40).
Training for rural women has been proposed to be centered on the activities they perform. In this regard, FAO (1989) indicated that normally this aspect is not considered since agricultural training has been directed towards activities which commonly women do not perform. In this sense, it affirms that "Women will not be sufficiently assisted by the agrarian extension services unless the extension message is more pertinent to their needs: related to the crops that women produce, the stock that she raises, the agricultural systems she uses and the time which she dedicates to her work'' (op. cit. pg. 98).
León (1986) believes, however, that the above in necessary but it is not sufficient. Training projects which would enable women to be more technically involved in their essential, usual activities such as gardens or care for smaller species, would contribute to reproducing the subordination of women if they take the existing work separation as a fact. The author defines the training as "the urgency to make the rural woman aware that what she does generates the power for making changes". (op. cit. pg. 13).
Finally, Aranda and (Olavarría, (1988) add important elements to the above. They believe that training should be made through the integration of three dimensions that contain the main missing factors of the poor, rural woman: economic-productive arena, organization and personal development.
Regarding the economic-productive factor, is should be considered, other than the technical element, training understood as "work education". According to this, the authors disregard providing technical specific knowledge favoring a "learning the job" experience; which is to say, a vision of the process in which technical aspects make sense. This perspective is proposed as the most adequate to provide rural women not only with modern techniques, but also with business management. In practical terms, training which combines both dimensions - techniques and management- also contains the advantage of being applicable as of the recognition of women's role as an agricultural producer and the reconsideration of the productive character of the home garden. The reality of rural women, their tasks and the environment with which they are associated, serve to boost those aspects where major faults are found.
In reference to organization, training should be focused on strengthening rural women 'e organizations. When confronting this, two important elements to be considered are proposed. First, the organization should constitute an instance where cultural traditions delegating woman to the private environment are discussed. Second, it must consider that many women's organizations reinforce the spirit of service of the woman and her domestic role; these are highly valued by women as a social participation which is different from the home. Training should strengthen these organizations so that they become more political with the ability to move and make demands throughout the community.
Regarding the personal development, they indicate that any project or program geared to rural women must be familiar with the problems which have been repeatedly proposed: domestic closing in, isolation, lack of participation, separation from society, and ignorance regarding relevant aspects of herself. Training for specific projects require a wider projection: beyond the type of program which should be brought into practice, "it requires a women with a minimum of knowledge and technical preparation, capable of expressing herself and her judgments, of forming and receiving criticisms. A participating woman; a woman "equal" to men; a woman that can be connected with external agents, go to cities, perform movements, apply for credits, program production, etc." (op. cit. pg. 41). In these terms, a training program emphasizing personal development may not obtain economic-productive results in the short term. However, in the long term its effects could become permanent thereby
leading to new training projects.
3.5 Conclusions and recommendations
The information regarding educational levels for the rural areas on a Regional level, separated by gender and ethnic group is not enough. For this insufficiency, one important recommendation is that the analysis of the census conducted in the 90's be made entailing a thorough review of the educational differentiation's in rural areas, a matter scarcely considered in the regional documents.
In recent decades, the Regional education has been characterized by an ever-growing coverage but with unequal distribution particularly between rural areas and cities. Therefore, the education of the rural women corresponds more to their geographical location than to their status as women: educational differences are larger between urban and rural women than between rural men and women.
Together with increased coverage of education, there has been a change in the rural people's valuation of education considering it is as necessary for their sons as for their daughters. Both occurrences are expressed in the fact that the education attained by young women is superior to those of older women which does not mean to say that the first count on adequate education.
The fact that young women have acquired higher educational levels than their mothers constitutes an auspicious element for development, training and technology transfer projects. Therefore, it is necessary to give these women special attention thus providing opportunities to avoid their facing an obligation to seek said opportunities in the urban environment.
Educational coverage has grown; however, it must be born in mind that for more than 50% of the individuals, it encompasses barely 6 years of primary education which is clearly insufficient for the development of these countries. Furthermore, there are high levels of course failure and abandonment.
Not only are there problems of coverage and permanence in the school system, but the teaching quality problem is also present. This is not fully relevant as it applies the urban curriculum and the same school order in rural areas.
As for rural women, gender stereotypes are added which reinforce their orientation towards fulfilling traditional roles by means of the school texts and the teaching methods used in the classroom.
There are different points of view with respect to the incidence of the education in attaining employment in rural areas. Some say that a higher educational level does not guarantee finding a job. Others, although they acknowledge that demands for work positions have increased, state that a higher education is essential in order to improve agricultural work productivity and technology transfer and therefore the quality of job performance.
Regarding training, rural women tend to be excluded because rural society and politics and the training organizations do not consider them as "worker". This also occurs because when training is offered, courses related to domestic work, not productive work, are offered. At the same time, women are interested in traditional courses and this interest is fostered by the organizations and grantors by not offering different alternatives.
It is erroneous to sustain that improvements have not been made. In fact, the productive project list for rural women is quite long in the majority of the countries and the same happens, although to a lesser extent, with those projects related to alternative technology transfer. What dote remain is that innovations have not been obtained in the majority of the cases to overcome the poverty of the population or break the role separation between men and women. The technological change does not affect the standard according to which men continue to withhold knowledge, technical abilities and power. Notwithstanding, the incorporation of new technologies has meant, to a certain degree, more employment for women: for example, in fruit growing businesses.
Recommendations to improve training directed to rural women are listed below:
- Training should start by considering rural women's points of view and interests, even though it initially may be limited to the domestic work;
- Parallely, educational authorities, organisms and officials who design and conduct training programs should be made aware of the perspective of equal opportunities for both sexes. The goal is to gradually offer women courses that are not traditional, that are linked with agriculture/farm management, and that provide the acquisition of abilities and specific techniques.
- Training directed to women must be conducted in productive activities that they perform which does not tend to occur habitually. In other words, incorporating knowledge and technology in their own, familiar areas, thereby gradually overcoming some uses and customs.
- All training should incorporate personal development of rural women and stimulate their involvement in social organizations, both of gender as well as of the community.
Training is important and enormous progress has been made handled, in the majority of the cases, by Non Governmental Organizations, but it is important to realize that they are directed to adult women and therefore only to a portion of them. Hence, the need to encourage rural women to increase their formal education will never be emphasized strongly enough and it will not be enough to provoke changes in gender separation through formal education. In fact, a more massive education may have the biggest impact.

Chapter 4: Rural families
A large part of rural women live in a family, whether it be her family or in the family which she has formed. This chapter will attempt to profile rural families through deduction, through different events occurring within the family: fertility, infant mortality, family group composition, marriage and power relationships between men and women established in the family.
4.1 Fertility and infants mortality in rural areas
Regional fertility rates have experienced great changes in recent decades. Since 1965, some countries exhibited changes in fertility which gradually extended to the rest of the countries. While around 1950 the average fertility rate was extremely high, 6 children per women, in the 1985-1990 period, the Regional average was 3.4 children per woman (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993). Therefore, the first affirmation regarding families in Latin America and the Caribbean is that they now have less family members than in the past.
The aforementioned does not imply that there has been a reduction in births: due to the fact that the decline in fertility is relatively recent and the structure per ages of many countries is still young, annual births increased from 7 to 12 million between 1950-1955 and 1985-1990 which, in absolute terms, implies an increase in the population in the majority of the countries (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993). This is to say that there are more inhabitants, but grouped in families that have, on the average, less children.
The decrease in fertility rates results from a number of socioeconomic and cultural factors which limit the exposition to sexual relationships, conception and pregnancy; such as the educational level attained, area of residency, occupation, health coverage, union (marriage) standards: These are the main ones, and they act over a group of variables denominated "intermediate variables" or "proximate determinants" which affect fertility at the same time^12.
^12 For more information see: Davis and Blake, 1967: Sociological factors of Fertility. Colegio de Mexico/CELADE, Mexico. Bongaarta, 1976: "A framework for analyzing the proximate determinants of fertility", Population and Development Review, vol. 4, No. 1, March.
Decreased fertility is a general phenomenon in the Region, but the transition of fertility has shown heterogeneity's among the countries as well as in them. Furthermore, it is recorded in a wider process known as "demographic transition" meaning that fertility changes are accompanied by mortality variations.
The "demographic transition" alludes to the change process of the population observed in western societies, and consists of the evolution from high fertility and mortality rates to low once. These occurrences are related to the social and economic transformations derived from industrial modernization (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).
According to gross birth and mortality rates observed in the 1985-1990 period, the Regional countries are classified into four demographic transition stages^13 (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993):
- Group I: Incipient Transition. Countries with high birth and mortality rates and moderate natural population growth rate around 2.5%: Bolivia and Haiti.
- Group II. Moderate Transition. Countries with a high birth rate and moderate mortality rate which lead to a high natural population growth rate, close to 3%: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay.
- Group III. Full Transition. Countries with a moderate birth rate and a moderate to low mortality rate with a moderate natural population growth rate, close to 2% Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, Suriname, Trinidad, Tobago and Venezuela.
- Group IV: Advanced Transition. Countries with a low birth rate and a moderate to low mortality rate with a low natural growth rate of the population around 1%: Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Chile, Cuba, Guadalupe, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico and Uruguay.
^13 It is expressed that these measures do not totally indicate fertility and mortality rates but that they determine the population growth and show the influence of the structure by ages. Additionally, they do not consider international migration due to its lesser influence in the growth evolution and the population structure.
A factor frequently associated with the demographic transition is urbanization, which permits stating that rural areas would systematically have greater fertility than urban areas. This comparison is based on theory and empiric experiences that generally evidence that the more urban the country, the more advanced its demographic transition. However, in some Regional countries this relationship is not casual: Bolivia is in the incipient transition category yet has an urban population percent higher than Costa Rica which is a country in full transition; Venezuela, the Latin American country with the second highest percent of urban population is not yet in the stage of advanced transition; Cuba, placed in the advanced demographic transition category has lower urbanization than the countries within the same group (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay). These cases show that the effects of urbanization on the transition phases are more related to the socioeconomic transformations of this
process than to the concentration of the population in urban areas. (J. Chackiel and M. Villa, 1992).
The relationships between demographic transition and urbanization do not appear to be based on reason, but there are two clear differences between fertility and mortality between the urban and rural areas which are greater in those countries in the less advanced stages of transition. This is due to the fact that the demographic transition begins in the urban environment and in more comfortable social sectors and is then spread to the rest of the population.
Regarding fertility, in countries situated in an advanced demographic transition stage rural and urban fertility converges. For example, in Chile and Cuba, urban and rural families tend to have approximately 2 and 3 children. In full transition countries, this convergency is just beginning to profile itself. Finally, in the moderate to incipient transition countries, there is decreased fertility in capital cities yet these changes are not seen in rural areas (J. Chackiel and M. Villa, 1992).
With these reservations, rural women tend to have more children than city women. The National Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in some countries during the '80's reveal this fact (Table 11). A significant number of rural women systematically declare that a high proportion of their real pregnancies are unwanted; meaning that women have *had more children than they would have wanted (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993). In the majority of the countries where this information is available, the true unwanted pregnancies are, in fact, larger than those declared by city women (Table 12). This could indicate that women in rural areas have less access to family planning methods. It would be convenient to conduct specific studies in greater depth which would clear up the role that the cultural factors play in this and specifically the resistance to change. It is clear, though, that at least in some countries, there seems not to be a valid ideal of a numerous family; rather, that many births
were unexpected or they were impossible to be avoided.

In rural families in Latin America and the Caribbean, infant mortality is also higher than in urban families. In the incipient and moderate countries, close to two-thirds of infant deaths are produced in rural areas where also half or more of the births occur (J. Chackiel and M. Villa, 1992); and, likewise, infant mortality in the indigenous population is higher. A recent study conducted in indigenous groups in Chile found the infant mortality rate to be 45 per 1,000 for 1985 while nationally it was 20 per 1,000 and in the high income sectors of the country's capital it was less than 10 per 1,000. This is to say, almost five times less than the estimate for indigenous groups (UFRO/INE/FII/PAESMI/CELADE, 1990). Recent information from some countries reveal urban-rural differences in infant mortality (Table 13).
Urban-rural differences bear a special importance since the death of children under one year of age is strongly associated with exogenous factors regarding health. On a family level, financial resources, the mother's education and the type of attention and care given to the child, as well as beliefs regarding the origin and treatment of illnesses, and sanitary provisions in the house act over an number of intermediate variables which determine the health-illness process of the child (Behm-Rosas, 1990). The lack of land and high destitution levels in rural areas of the Region (aspects which are analyzed in Chapter 1) could be factors associated with high infant mortality rates. The fact that the definition of poverty and destitution is associated to income, however, ignores that portion of the rural population whose productive strategy centers on animal-vegetable diversification supplementation since there is evidence (Lanz-Valdivia, 1990) that it centers more on consumption
and savings than on generating income. This focus generally leads to better nutrition of the family group thereby making it implicit the probability that in that particular group the infant mortality rates are lower.
In summary, a great part of rural families in Latin America and the Caribbean have entered the demographic transition phase in a heterogenous manner according to each country. Generally, they present fertility and mortality rates that are higher in rural areas. This is to say that there are changes, rural women live in smaller families, they want to control their fertility, but do not always have the necessary means to do so.
Looking at the future, demographic transition progress is expected in all of the Regional countries. Based on levels and trends in fertility, it is estimated that in the last five years of the century, women will have an average of 2.8 children and around the year 2020 this figure will decrease to 2.1; meaning the level required for the population to maintain its numbers. The analysis conducted per country reveals that those countries situated in Groups I and II will reach this level 10 years after the Regional average. The Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, Martinique and Puerto Rico are currently at this level, while women in the rest of the countries in Groups III and IV will have, by the year 2010, an average number of children lower than 2.5.

Notwithstanding these projections, the influence that development strategies and continuous expansion of the media in many countries have over the ever-growing social sectors cannot be discarded. This promotes the idea of a small family through diffusing established standards of consumption and living and the generalized access to family planning methods (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).
Independent from the aforementioned, the diffusion of cultural standards tending to reduce fertility and extend family planning programs could play important roles in rural areas, specifically in the countries found in Group I and II. When these elements are absent, current rural fertility tendencies in these countries indicate that they would remain above urban averages for decades.
In Group III countries, a gradual decrease should come about between the rural and urban differences, while Group IV shows certain convergence in the fertility of both areas. However, it must be born in mind that the average behavior hides the heterogeneities within the countries, thereby ignoring the presence of social sectors which could require as much attention as shone bearing significant weight in the countries in Groups I and II.
The estimates regarding infant mortality indicate that only 8 countries in Latin America reached the WHO goal known as "Health for All in the Year 2000": infant mortality rate below 30 per 1,000. In the Caribbean, the majority of the countries have reached this goal with rates under 20 per 1,000, with the exception of Guyana (56 per 1,000) and Suriname (33 per 1,000) (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).
Regarding rural areas, it is important to consider that the reduction of infant mortality in the Region has had a common characteristic in 811 countries: the conduction of mass vaccination and oral rehydration programs and the spreading of health services and coverage. Furthermore, fertility rate reduction has played an important role in decreasing the proportion of the births with greater fatal risk (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993). In addition to the motivation of similar initiatives for rural areas, it would be recommendable to verify in a broader context if, in effect, the productive examples based on manual labor-intensive programs with diversified production strategies have lead to families with lower mortality rates. These results could set some grounds for policies recommendations in the Regional countries.
4.2 Family structure and type in rural areas
In recent decades profound changes in the rural family features in Latin America and the Caribbean have been experienced. These changes have implied the modification of the stereotypes of large families with young marriages, high levels of fertility and the large permanence of its members under the authority of the "father of the family". Today, there is the following trend:
- increase in the number of small families and decrease in the incidence of large families;
- increase in one member and incomplete families; decrease in or delay of marriages;
- decrease in the birth rate;
- the female heading the home;
- the proletarization of women;
- the lack of parents and emigration (CEPAL, 1986).
Although this cannot be fully applied to all Regional countries, nor to all geographic areas within each country, it may be claimed that the tendency in rural family organization will continue in such direction, basically related to the predominance of small families.
In Latin America and the Caribbean small families are more diffused. This is not a recent occurrence: figures for Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and Guatemala show that this trend was already prevailing in the '60's and '70's representing approximately between 50% and 58% of the total number of families. The percent of large families is between 20% and 35% and composed families between 12% and 19% (CEPAL, 1993).
A notable occurrence contradicting the normally used givens is that the preeminence of small families is generally associated with modernity, industrialization and urbanization; that is to say, categories that are the opposite to the rural world. However, in the Regional rural areas, small families prevail and even their proportion has become greater than in the urban areas. In Peru, small families in 1984 represented 53.4% in urban areas and 58.0% in rural areas (Market: "Family, sexuality and Family Planning. Basic Population Educational Texts"; CEPAL, 1993). In the Dominican Republic, as per the 1981 census, in urban zones, 47% of the families were small, 34% were large and 9% were mixed; rural areas, in turn, represented 55% as small families, 28%, as large and 5% as mixed. (Durate and Gómez: "The Family in the Dominican Republic: trends and features", CEPAL, 1993).
The fact that there are more small families in rural areas than in urban areas does not hold true in all countries. In Uruguay, for example, in 1985, there was a greater percent of small families in urban areas than in the rural ones despite that in both contexts small families prevails: 59.3% and 56.5%, respectively. Large families represented 19.9% in the urban area and 17.2% in the rural area while mixed families were more in the latter area (10.5% against 5.8%). More recent figures from Venezuela (1990) show similar characteristics, meaning that the majority of the rural families (51.8%) corresponds to small families, but that in the urban areas this percentage is slightly higher: 54.8%. Larger and mixed families represent practically the same percentage in both zones: 26% and 12% (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993. Volumes correspond to each country).
As it can be seen, families in rural areas of the Region are predominantly small for which one may believe that this type of family is the ideal, even though some people cannot achieve this. Notwithstanding, the portion of non-small families is important, especially the larger ones. Approaching this, the question arises as to whether or not the extended family exists because it is impossible to survive any other way or if it constitutes a family living option. It would seem that larger families respond to a survival strategy. In this regard, it has been claimed that rural families related to the working market tend to be smaller. Those that participate in production processes internal consumption prefer to use family manual labor which leads to mixed or larger families (CEPAL, 1986).
Conforming to the aforementioned, a study wee conducted analyzing three lives of rural people in Central Chile revealed that the rural family over recent decades appeared as a refuge against economic deterioration, as a place to retain manual labor given that urban and rural employment opportunities obstructed migration and independence of the younger homes. The family became a place to resist economic crises which spread throughout the country in the '80's tending to transform it into larger families whenever wages or family production required Valdés 1992).
Rural women form their families at an earlier age than urban women although both start at a relatively early age. Considering the average age for their first marriage as an indicator, available data for some countries show differences of about 2 years. The average age in rural areas is from 19 years old in the Dominican Republic to 21.7 years in Peru. In urban areas, the ages are from 20.8 in the Dominican Republic to 23.3 in Costa Rica. However, in the Caribbean (Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad Tobago) the average age for the first marriage in rural areas is relatively older than in urban areas (around 0.6 years, Table 14).

The differences in the average age of the first marriage for rural and urban women is explained by factors that rest on the idea that the marrying age of women is related to education, area of residence and the type of occupation they perform: the highest age for marriage occurs with women who attained a higher education, who reside in cities and are employed in modern occupations (CEPAL, 1993).
The average age considers all types of "marital unions", for which it is interesting to center on the types of existing unions: it would seem that the difference is related to cultural factors; such as, for example, ethnic group customs (United Nations, 1990).
Latin America and the Caribbean is the continent of the world where living together or consensual union is the greatest. This cannot be considered as, in general, a signal of emancipation from women rather, quite the opposite of their poverty and low contractual power (CEPAL, 1993). Consensual undone are greater in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Panama, and El Salvador. In the remainder of the countries, important proportions are appreciated excepting in Puerto Rico and Chile where this type of marriage is minimal: 5.4% and 4.6%, respectively (Table 15, Graph 10).
Charbit ("Famille et nupcialité dans la Caraïbe", 1987, CEPAL, 1993) upon analyzing the important proportion of consensual fond in the Caribbean, indicated that the main determining factor of these unions is poverty. The author formed and interesting description regarding women'. life cycle in consensual unions, particularly those who have children from many partners; the above, based on in-depth interviews, confirmed by quantitative data: it generally concerns poor, uneducated women who lack knowledge on sexuality and family planning for which they tend to have early, unwanted pregnancies. Furthermore, they have scarce work training and do not see themselves as self-sufficient workers. Therefore' they center there trust and aspirations on marriage. They do not propose demands on the man, either before or after their sexual or conjugal relationship, since they assume that bearing a child will ensure the support of their partners.
Regarding the duration of consensual unions, they tend to be more unstable than legal marriages in more relative developed countries such as Costa Rica and Colombia. In less developed countries, such as Mexico and Peru, they can be more permanent due perhaps to the influence of sociocultural factors, especially in the indigenous population which grant greater social support (Krumholz and Alcántara: "Marriage patterns: age at marriage and marriage stability" 1982, CEPAL, 1993).

Available information for some countries show diverse situations in unions of rural women. In Cuba and Guatemala, for example, the majority of women between 15 and 49 years of age have a partner (about 65%). However, while in Cuba 25.0% of women are married and 43.2% are "united" (1987); in Guatemala (1989), 25.9% are women who live with someone and 40.3% are married (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO, Chile, ed. 1993. Volumes correspond to each country). In Colombia, in small and large families, 70% of the unions are legal and 30% are de facto (FAO, 1991d). In El Salvador, 61.7% of the unions conducted in rural areas are free unions and in Venezuela they are a common rule (FAO 1991b). Legally, de facto relationships are acknowledged in Guatemala and Cuba, while in Colombia, although there is no legal acknowledgment, there is a favorable jurisprudence in this regard (FAO, 1991b).
A topic that has acquired special importance in recent decades is the feminine leadership of the home, which similarly to consensual unions, could be either a sign of feminine power and autonomy or vulnerability. There are no official statistics for both the Region and rural areas; however, there seems to be a consensus that between 20%-40% of the Latin American and Caribbean homes are lead by women (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993:65). FAO (1992b:43) indicates that Latin American homes under female leadership range from 15%-30%, and that a large number of these homes is located in rural areas. According to the same source, in the Caribbean, female heads of households represent 40% or 50%.
Available information for 12 countries in the Region reveals that the feminine leadership of the home is greater in urban areas. In rural areas, it varies between 11% and 19% (Table 16). This shows that feminine leadership in the home pertains more to the urban environment than the rural areas.
In response to the question of what is the significance of feminine leadership, one could reply that, more than anything else, it is a sign of poverty. Female household leaders tend to belong to poor homes and tend to duplicate this poverty throughout generations. As per various studies, this is due to the fact that they tend to have more dependents, their low income and their performing economic and domestic functions. The latter limits their possibilities of job selection and schedules, since they must be balanced with the children's care and therefore these women must accept lower wages (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).

Given the traditional definition of men leading the house, it is logical to expect that the majority of the women who head their households do not have a partner. For example, in Costa Rica, of the total female household heads in rural areas in 1984, 10.8% were married and 5.4% declared to have some type of union. Widows and single women showed similar percentages: 30.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Divorces reached 4.0%, and separations represented 19.1% of the total women in charge of their homes. (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Costa Rica). A similar situation is found among indigenous groups in Chile, where women in charge of their homes were mostly widows (59.7%), 25.5% were single women and those who maintained some type of partner (living together, civil marriages or by Mapuche law) represented only 7.1% (UFRO/INE/FII/PAESMI/CELADE, 1990).
These figures reveal that the majority of women who are in charge of the house do not have a partner and when adding those who are married and in some way united in Costa Rica about 16% of these women have partners, while in Chile, 7.1% of the indigenous women have a partner. Although they may constitute the minority, they in some way represent a unique situation as these are homes in which although there is a man, the woman assumes the role as head of the house. Given that there is no further information in this regard, one could think that declaring a civil marriage status or living together is merely an acknowledgment and that in reality the man is absent from the home. These figures could also indicate that, at least among these women, the traditional power relation is questioned among these couples which is a matter of interest to be investigated.
4.3 Family and gender work division
An important aspect to be considered is the structure of the relationships within the rural family, specifically in the productive environment and the work division per gender. In general, a clear division of roles by gender and age is seen. In Bolivia, for example, rural families articulate the productive and reproductive work for family survival. Families have a patriarchal structure and the work division is based on a gender and age distribution of the work. The family is organized in communities where men assume the representation of the family (FAO, 1991b).
In homes under feminine leadership, one could think that women assume the productive role which was previously performed by the man. However, a study of three homes headed by women, located in Santa Ana, El Salvador, revealed a different reality (Lok, 1993). On the farms where there was no husband or partner, whether due to death, abandonment or temporary migration, no radical changes in the work division of gender are observed. Changes do apply in the distribution of time dedicated to the farm tasks and the role that the woman in charge of the household plays in decision making: generally, women seek other men to perform those tasks which were performed by their husband (brother, neighbor, day worker) while they play a dominating role in decision making.
The above forces us to classify (Bernstein, 1987) or divide the private and public world, and men and women who mold work distribution within the rural families. This is seen also in another study conducted in two municipalities of the Jutiapa department, Guatemala (Urueta and Karremans, 1993), where there wee a very clear delimitation of gender roles: women act in a domestic sphere while those activities less related to the home are performed by men. The domestic sphere does not exclude women from income-generating activities (for example, breeding smaller animals, or post-harvest processing) but they do not always make the decisions regarding the use of their earnings since men consider that making the most important decisions on the farm is their own right. Children help their parents indiscriminately in the beginning, but later they begin to center on defined activities belonging to their gender: boys, between 8 - 10 years old and girls at the age of 11. Women work on
so-called masculine jobs when there is scarce masculine manual labor, however they abandon said activities when such need disappears.
According to the authors, rural economy in general demonstrates its flexibility in the productive strategies minimizing risks and covering the lack of lands or manual labor at specific times. Such flexibility is noted in the changes of tasks assigned to each sex and to those who are under age. However, the authors indicate that this does not imply that a new task, resulting from innovation, will be developed by any other member of the family: "...under "normal" conditions, men dedicate to what is traditionally theirs and women to theirs" (op. cit. pg. 106). Flexibility would imply the possibility of changes in work divisions, but, as per the authors, a division in responsibilities and income favoring women should be based on the existing cultural standards that are shared by men and women.
This last proposal is contradictory and in the long run, it will consecrate immovability. To allow women to accede power and decision-making roles would imply questioning existing cultural standards. One cannot ask that which is to be changed, i.e. the traditional work division standards between the sexes, also be the change factor at the same time. On the contrary, historically, the changes in the gender roles definition were never produced at the same time in men and women. The questioning of the discriminatory cultural standards towards women should, in the first place, start by the women's own initiative.
Regarding large families, the referenced study stated that in these type of homes crop production is performed separately while stock management is shared. Women cooperate among themselves in other activities: meal preparation, care of children when one is unable to, and similar tasks.
4.4 Conclusions and recommendations
Currently, families are smaller than they were fifty years ago and even ten years ago. There are more inhabitants in Latin America and the Caribbean but the family groups, on an average, are smaller. This is due to the fact that the birth rate has decreased: in 1950, women averaged 6 children while nowadays, the average is 3.4 children. This does not imply a reduction in birth rates: annual births increased from 7 to 12 million between 19501955 and 1985-1990 which translated into an increase in the population in the majority of the countries.
A decreased in the number of births is related to socioeconomic and cultural factors which act over a number of "intermediate variables" which influence their behavior. Furthermore, it rests on the process known as "demographic transition" which has been experienced differently by each country of the Region.
Demographic transition is a process that was historically observed first in western societies and consists of the changing from high mortality and birth rates to low levels. This is associated with sociocultural and economic changes derived from industrial modernization.
Regional countries have been classified into four stages within the demographic transition according to their current mortality and birth rates. Bolivia and Haiti are in the "incipient transition" stage; Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Chile, Cuba, Guadalupe, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico and Uruguay are in the "advanced transition" stage. The rest of the countries are situated mainly in the "full transition" stage with moderate birth rates and moderate and low mortality rates.
Theoretically is it hoped to find an association between urbanization and demographic transition, but in some countries in the Region, there is no relationship between both phenomena; therefore, demographic transition is due to other socioeconomic and cultural transformations.
The demographic transition begins in well-off urban sectors and then spreads to the other sectors. According to the statistics, rural women in Latin America and the Caribbean have more children than do urban women. This, of course, does not consider abortion which presumably is higher in the city than in the country, where a more solid criteria regarding unborn human life is stronger. The differences between birth and mortality rates in urban and rural areas are greater in countries found in the less advanced stages of demographic transition.
Rural women on an average have more children than do urban women; a percentage of them, varying per country, and considering 8 of the Region's countries, declares that some children were not wanted. This could mean that the idea of a small family is growing or that survival conditions in the country have deteriorated.
Rural families tend to have more children, but also, as a rule, infant mortality is also greater in the indigenous population. This is due to the deficient living conditions of rural families which affect the health of the children: scarce economic resources in the home, sanitary deficiencies in housing, low educational levels of rural mothers, popular beliefs that are not always correct regarding the origin and treatment of the illnesses.
It is predicted that in the majority of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, fertility will have to stabilize during the second decade of the coming century with an average of 2.1 children per woman. However, countries placed in the "incipient " and "moderate" demographic transition, and particularly rural areas of the other countries would not reach that average if there are no cultural communications leaning towards reducing birth rates and over all if the coverage and quality of family planning programs is not extended. If no effort is made regarding family planning matters, the current fertility rates in rural areas will remain above urban levels for various years.
Many children die in the rural areas in Latin America and the Caribbean and estimates regarding infant mortality are not encouraging. They indicate that only 8 countries in Latin America will reach a rate lower than 30/1,000 by the end of the century while the countries of the Caribbean, excepting Guyana and Suriname, present a better situation.
Infant mortality will remain high as well in rural areas unless the coverage in widened, health services are broadened and mass vaccination and oral rehydration programs are applied.
Rural families have experienced profound changes over recent decades, modifying cultural patterns centered on large, large families, early marriages and strong paternal authority. Currently, behaviors are oriented towards similar patterns to urban areas; which is to say, there is a trend towards smaller families, couples with less children, and delaying the marrying age. Currently, official statistics bring to light that there are homes under feminine leadership and responsibility.
A noteworthy phenomenon is that the rural families of this Region are predominantly small and in some countries the proportion of these families is even higher in the country than in urban areas. This shows that the predominant family ideal in rural areas is that of a smaller one and it questions the givens associating small families with modernity, industrialization and urbanization which is to say, categories that are opposite to the rural world.
Although small families prevail in rural areas, there is an important portion of large families whose existence seems to answer - as in the cities - strategies of family survival in the country more than a family living conception.
The age of forming a couple is higher when women have higher educational levels, reside in cities and work in a modern occupation. These issues do not apply to rural environments, thereby explaining why rural women in Latin America and the Caribbean tend to find a couple at an earlier age than do urban women.
A Regional peculiarity refers to the type of union; this is the continent with the highest rate of consensual unions, although differences between the countries are observed. Consensual unions are more common in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Panama and El Salvador while they bear minimal importance in countries like Puerto Rico and Chile. Regarding their duration, they tend to be less stable in countries with greater relative socioeconomic development. In less developed countries, many times they respond to cultural and indigenous patterns which grants a greater social support and, therefore, stability.
Differences in the proportion of consensual unions in rural areas among the different countries in the Region do not appear to obey a reasonable pattern and it is a matter which could be interesting to explore in greater depth. For example, in Cuba 25% of the women who have a partner are married and 43.2% are "united" while in Guatemala 25.9% are living together and 40.3% are married; in Colombia 70% of the unions are legal and 30% are de facto unions; in El Salvador, 61.7% of the unions are free and in Venezuela the latter is the common rule. Perhaps the differences are explained by greater or lesser adhesion to the norms of the Catholic Church but not to the fact that consensual unions are legally acknowledged or not. Countries where there is legal recognition of consensual unions reveal very different proportions of the same in rural areas.
The feminine leadership of the house in rural areas of the Region has acquired growing interest recently even if there are no official figures which estimate its scope. However, based on information from some countries, it is seen that the feminine leadership of the household is more frequent in the urban environment and in rural areas it comprises between 11% and 19% of the homes.
The majority of the female heads do not have a partner. However, there is a low portion, although not irrelevant, of women who claim to be the heads of the home with a partner, which would indicate an error or voluntary distortion in declaring the civil status or rather an indicator that shows their questioning the traditional relationships of power within the couple. This point would also be interesting to investigate more.
These women tend to belong to poor homes and tend to pass on their poverty for generations. Considering the unfavorable conditions already described that women face in rural society in their productive insertion, it is easy to understand the close relationship between poverty and feminine dominance in the home, particularly when the family sustenance depends exclusively on her. In this regard, female leadership in the home constitutes a specific target group to be considered as a priority when forming policies for rural women.
As it has already been analyzed in the chapter on productive insertion of rural women, the structure of productive relationships within rural families is based on gender and age roles where men assume family representation and decision making. It has been observed that in time of crises this division la modified, but later is resumed when the crises has been overcome.
This points to the foundations of the traditionally assigned roles to each gender in the family. It also suggests that in order to overcome the rigid limitations in the private and public environment, the members of the family must be aware of this aspect as well as the organizations and institutions which contribute to the socioeconomic and cultural development of the rural areas of the Region.
The most efficient actions to achieve effects in the families would be indirect actions, meaning these that have a material, solid base. For example, programs linked to agricultural production improvement. Another manner to create awareness of equal opportunities in the family should be made through the formal educational system modifying the different studies and adjusting them to a new family concept.

Chapter 5: Rural women involved in power positions
The term "Involvement" has had and still has all types of meanings. However, its study imposes methodological restrictions derived from the fact that little information can be compiled regarding such a topic without going into depth of the socioeconomic and cultural aspects which condition it. This Chapter will familiarize its readers with the types of participation that were detected, signaling, although, the limitations inherent in the limited, available sources. Also analyzed are limitations which are related to the access to power in the family, work environment, the community and in politics.
5.1 Participation in decision making in production
Despite their active contribution to agricultural production, the literature reviewed shows that generally rural women are scarcely involved in the administration of the farms and with the decisions regarding production allotment and as to how the income is used.
Women tend to make decisions regarding home management. However, decisions regarding what to produce, production results and, in general, relationships of the productive unit with external participants are managed by men (León de Leal, Women and Agrarian Capitalism, 1980, Errázuriz, 1987). In Bolivia, for example, the family budget and structure of the expenses are defined by man, while women are assigned to their administration. The expenses are prioritized in the following manner, first they are designated to production, then to food and in third place to clothing, education and health (Arteaga: "Economic recession, living strategies and the woman's role in Bolivia," 1988, FAO, 1991b).
Notwithstanding the above, there are certain conditions which denote greater feminine involvement. One investigation conducted in rural communities in Colombia and Peru showed that the incidence of women in decision making regarding the use of supplies grew as the size of the farm became smaller and that women made the decisions regarding the uses of seeds and fertilizer in 52% of the poorest farms and 27% of the richer ones (Women and agricultural and stock breeding modernization; balance, perspectives and strategies, IICA, 1991, FAO, 1993d).
Along this same line, some Andean communities have demonstrated that when the occupation and type of production is diversified and the importance of agriculture declines regarding the generation of the income, women increase their decision-making power and their amount of work as well (FAO, 1993d).
Women's involvement in the administration of the farms is also related to the temporary or permanent absence of their partner which, in turn, obliges them to assume the role as the head of the house. In this regard, Crummet (1987) indicates that the participation of the women in family production and her responsibility has increased in those families where the man leaves, which is associated to a smaller size of land, to the formation of large families and the decrease of employment opportunities in agricultural activities. In the Caribbean, for example, the masculine migration, either for short or long terms, has forced women to take charge of the farm. This has lead to a "feminization" of the land management, increasing Caribbean rural women involvement.
However, along with this feminization of management, a feminine expulsion has been produced: as the economic activities of the Region have been expanding, the rural woman has been attracted to sectors that are not related to agriculture, particularly industrial activities. This confronts a double phenomenon: on one hand, there is the feminization of agricultural land management as well as the simultaneous "defeminization" of the same due to the search on the woman's behalf of employment out of the agricultural sector. However, finding oneself in one situation or the other is not a random circumstance, rather it relates to the age and education levels of the women. Those who leave the agricultural sector are generally youths which have attained a minimum level of education. Those remaining or returning to the farm are older with relatively lower education levels (Chase, 1989).
5.2 Participation in social organizations
Policies and intentions in this aspect are clear. The World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development organized by FAO in 1979 elaborated an Action Program whose declaration of principles (item XIV) establishes that "the woman should participate under equal conditions as the man in social, economic and political processes of rural development, as well as fully share the benefits of improved living conditions in Rural zones" (FAO, 1991a: 5). It is proposed that, in order to achieve the integration of women to the development of the countries, the support of their organized participation is fundamental. This implies transferring to them the necessary political power which leads to their participation in decision making in the family and the community, in defending their individual and collective interests. As usual, the key is knowing how many of said orientations have really translated into a change in the reality.
Analysis regarding the participation of rural women in activities beyond the family and domestic scene conclude that, in general, women do not have greater interests in participating because it takes them away from their main environment which is the home. When they become involved in the local level, they tend to project their domestic role on a wider scale. It has also been said that the double work shift to which the rural woman is subject make it difficult for her to participate in organizations since she does not have the time nor the energy to develop other activities that are not her domestic and productive tasks. Furthermore, the secondary role she performs in society make it difficult for the community to grant her a space for her participation Errázuriz, 1987).
In all of the countries in the Region, rural women's involvement in social organizations show some common resemblance's:
a) women's participation has been slightly broadened in the basis of rural organizations, but there are problems of leadership, particularly in mixed or complex organizations (cooperatives, production associations, settlements);
b) rural women are hardly involved in decision making within their community where the belief that the family should be represented by the male head of the house prevails;
c) in many countries rural women's organizations have surged in response to economic needs and in the search for solutions to common problems. Through these organizations, the woman has learned to value herself and her work and has earned positions of participation in the family and community (FAO, 1992b).
Regarding the participation of women in production cooperatives, they are generally excluded since the criteria for membership is property or leadership of the home which are matters reserved for men. When women are involved, their participation is scarce (FAO, 1989). However, there are certain cases in which women play important roles in this type of association. For example, in Paraguay three large cooperatives in rural areas are lead by women: Ñeembucú, Itacarubí de la Cordillera and Paraguarí^14 women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Paraguay).
^14 There are 125 cooperatives that are legally acknowledged in the rural environment in Paraguay corresponding to production, savings and credit. The document quoted does not specify the year this condition took place nor the characteristics of the cooperatives lead by women.
Over recent years, many rural unions and guilds have generated within their groups feminine departments. For example, in Paraguay, the Paraguayan Rural Movement (MCP) created the Rural Women's Coordination (CMC) in 1985. This group held two national congresses in 1989 and 1991. During the second one, diverse resolutions were made; among them, the structuring of the organization at all levels; training rural women in political-ideological matters so as to assume leadership positions; creation of literacy centers, and fostering production for self-consumption. Furthermore, they sought the support of their partners from the Paraguayan Rural Movement and requested that the government provide more social investments and improved prices for their products. Seemingly in Paraguay, the rural women's organizations is weak: of the 26 women organizations existing in 1993 in Paraguay, the rural area only counted on one group, the Rural Women's Coordination (CMC) (Women's Institute,
Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Paraguay).
In Ecuador, the main rural confederations have a women's department, among them, UNASAY (Rural Union of Azuay), and FUPOCPS (Provincial Federation of Rural and Popular Organizations of the South) (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Ecuador).
In 1990 Brazil held its First Congress of the National Department of Rural Workers (DNTR-CUT). At that time, the "National Council on Rural Female Workers Affairs" was created designed to counsel the executive department of DNTR (Women's Institute, Spain-FLACSO Chile, ed. 1993, Brazil).
There have also been rural women's organizations that are relatively autonomous regarding other rural affairs created (rural union associations, political parties). These organizations that are specifically feminine have proposed diverse demands, among them being the access to land ownership which has been recalled in recent years: in Bolivia, the National Federation of Rural Women was created in 1980; in Colombia, the National Association of Rural and Indigenous Women was created in 1984; in Brazil during the First Congress of Rural Women (1985); in Honduras, the Federation of Rural Women. In Nicaragua and Cuba diverse social organizations have became a considerable factor to women's integration to the agrarian cooperatives (León, Prieto and Salazar, 1987).
5.3 The vision women have concerning their involvement in social organizations
Perhaps the most appropriate vision required to analyze the involvement of rural women in social organizations would be that of the opinion of the women themselves. Studies conducted in some countries in the Andean area demonstrate this perspective alluding to the main achievements and limitations that rural, organized women see in their own organization including, in general, some aspects regarding rural life.
The methodology employed consisted in the application of the Participatory Research among Women (IPEM). Those who participated in the workshop conducted processes on reflection of their condition as women and their organization, as well as an evaluation of their main achievements and limitations within their organization. One exception is the study of the National Association of Rural and Indigenous Women of Colombia (ANMUCIC), where the analysis of their achievements includes information obtained from secondary sources and individual interviews held with the Association's leaders and officials who are familiar with the organizations experiences in addition to the female's opinions.
5.3.1 The national confederation of mothers' organizations in Bolivia (CNCMB)
It is interesting to look at a type of traditional women's organization: mother's centers. In Bolivia, the CNCMB's situation was analyzed which groups mothers' organizations from both rural and urban areas (FAO, 1991b). These organizations emerged in the '60's, induced by government policies aimed at rationalizing food delivery. The CNCMB was created in the '80's, in rural areas, it is the only national women's association that groups rural women from different ethnic backgrounds, cultures, ecoregions whose sole requirement is that members must be mothers. Some mothers' organizations in rural areas conduct productive projects in diverse subjects and in the majority of the cases they do not have the adequate technical assistance.
The study worked with two mothers' organizations: Pairumani and Santiago de Liallagua. The participants of the first are Quechuas and the second are Aymaras; both groups perform productive activities yet in the first one there is greater organization and diversity in their activities.
According to the participants in this investigation, the women were able to obtain that their husbands allow them to attend the club meetings as well as having them care for the children and perform domestic tasks that day. They acquired their own position in the communities as well as recognition and valuing of women's work, both from themselves and the community. Furthermore, they learned how to express themselves in public. Despite these achievements however, they indicated that they were unable to legitimize their participation as a gender in community decision making processes. This is due, generally, to the fact that in rural areas, particularly the Aymara area, women are not accepted for representation in traditional organizations nor in rural unions.
The main problems women indicated are: a) excessive workloads which imply a lack of time to develop other activities than their domestic ones; b) lack of water for irrigation which influences their productive and domestic tasks; c) restricted access to education and d) excessive looting of lands and lack thereof. The women expressed that they themselves, their husbands, their children, the community, religion and society in general consider that women are inferior to men: "We respect our husband and that they must care for us as an egg"; "Eve was a sinner and we must bear her sin"; "Women must obey men" (FAO, 1991b:32). They also indicated that their grandmothers enjoyed better health, nutrition and greater production; but, at the same time they value the feet that their daughters have the possibility to attend school since this will mean a better quality of life for them.
The proposed solutions include technical assistance including the formation of leaders, instruments to access credits, better education and training, domestic work division within the family and some works of infrastructure regarding the leek of water. This would imply the development of better negotiation capacity, assumption of the gender conscience by rural women and the stimulation and strengthening of productive projects.
5.3.2 Women's organization of the department federation of rural people of Cusco (OMFDCC)
A similar study conducted in Peru (FAO, 1991c) analyzed a women's organization which is part of a rural union association. These organizations have been spaces generated within the Rural Federation so as to obtain a better presence of rural women and their specific problems. Although progress has been achieved in terms of consolidating women's groups in the Federation, the positions earned by women in the organization are insufficient: very few women hold major positions and in order to assume responsibilities they must develop a long list of merits.
Despite the above, the participation in these organizations has had an impact on women personally, family wise, in the community and in the organization, similar to the manner described in Bolivia. Personally, they have overcome their fear and insecurity in expressing their ideas. As for families, they have attained the support of their husbands and children which sometimes implied battles within the families. They highlight this modification indicating, among other aspects, "We consult with our husbands on all activities" (op. cit. pg. 21). This indicates the relegation that they have traditionally suffered; therefore, the "consultation" becomes a significant achievement. Concerning the community, they have obtained a recognition for their activities. Within the organizations, they have developed the capacity to generate their own resources which has given them a certain autonomy. Even though achievements within the community and family have been attained, they were the
least expressed and women still feel that they have much more to obtain.
The main external limitations for the organization that women expressed include the governmental sphere, political parties and the community to which the organization belongs.
Regarding the government, they indicated that in its institutions they are treated poorly when effecting procedures due to the fact that they are women and that they come from rural areas to which they add racial discrimination. Furthermore, the social support policies give help only to "Mothers' Organizations". This is the reason why many organizations change their name of "Women's Committee" to "Mothers' Organization." This will imply a deviation from the objective for which such organizations were created and although they may have produced an increase in members, many of them will remain in the organization while they are being helped.
Regarding political parties, they indicated that all parties without exception limit the autonomy of women's organization and attempt to submit them to different "slogans".
In reference to the community, many women indicated the strong social pressure designed basically to limit women's involvement making them subject to ridicule which is frequently used as a persuasion device.
Among the internal limitations indicated by women, there is heterogeneity of the members in terms of interests and participation. This produces distinct attitudes towards the organization and many times leads to operating difficulties. Furthermore, it is hard to form new leaders for which there is a low turnover among the leadership positions. Illiteracy, Spanish education and limited access to adequate training influence the capacity to generate new leaders. They also mentioned that there are communication problems regarding the basis: women require more information. Finally, they indicated that the government aid programs produce internal separations and the lack of funds limit the functioning of the Women's Organization.
The main problems that women perceive within the Women's Organization of the Cusco Department Federation of Rural People are related to:
a) the marketing of its products, because of intermediaries. The majority of the women are dedicated to trade and this directly affects them for which it is proposed to broaden the direct sales markets;
b) the absence of credits for women's organizations due to the fact that it is impossible to comply with the established requirements;
c) lack of health services for their families and reproductive health for women. They propose to recover and diffuse treatments with medicinal herbs which has been overlooked in the recent past;
d) educational deficiencies linked with the lack of interest of the parents in their education which is expressed by the fact that the majority of the women participating in the workshop are illiterate. However, they can envision a change: they and their partners want all of their children to be educated. The current problem would be the quality of the instruction; and
e) the leek of adequate mass media which causes women in one sector feel isolated from the others. Transportation is very expensive and they propose to return to using donkeys, mules and horses to transport their products suggesting that the communities who possess grasslands dedicate to breeding work animals.
The proposal to return to traditional medicine and transportation is interesting. Apparently, "modernity" has not reached these women and they do not visualize its access in the near future.
5.3.3 The popular feminine circle of nutrias port
In Venezuela the Popular Feminine Circle of Nutrias Port wee studied (FAO, 1991e). It began back in 1973 and emerged under the protection of the Catholic Church directed to Biblical knowledge and religious practice. Currently, it centers on the promotion of the organization and women's education so as to aid them in discovering their role and contribution which they may make to the development of the popular organization and community. Both the achievements and internal and external limitations that women mention are similar to those mentioned by the Bolivian and Peruvian women.
Regarding the main achievements of the organization, they mentioned the following:
a) improved family relationships and a change in the husband's attitude regarding their participation;
b) overcoming shyness, granting more self-esteem, gender awareness and motivation for the organization;
c) the generation of income through hand-crafts; and
d) institutional support expressed by training courses and establishing relationships with other community organizations.
In reference to the external limitations, they are listed below:
a) the family imposes restrictions of their participation due to the time required for domestic duties;
b) the lack of money for transportation which would be more due to low family incomes than for the lack of access and control of the financial resources in the home;
c) the shyness of the women;
d) the deficit of paid work sources which affects the State of Barinas. The lack of adequate commercializing channels and scarce access to credit;
e) problems with other community organizations regarding leadership within the community and ridiculing their participation from their neighbors. However, this would act as a reinforcement of their participation and their feeling of belonging;
f) despite the fact that the Government offers them with support, an significant number of women perceive that their organization is not trusted and they also feel manipulated by the political parties and the government.
Within the internal limitations of the organization the following are mentioned:
a) small turnover of the directive positions and low number of new members incorporated;
b) lack of economic resources which hinders activities and growth of the organization;
c) lack of training; and
d) scarce formation of new leaders.
5.3.4 The national association of rural and indigenous women of Colombia (ANMUCIC)
A study was conducted in Colombia regarding the ANMUCIC which was created in 1986 (FAO, 1991d). Unlike the organizations analyzed above in Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela, this group is peculiar since it emerged from the Government "as support and a condition for the success of continuity and strengthening of the development policy for rural woman whose main objective is to train women in order to participate in productive projects and in social and communitarian development processes" (op. cit. pg. 18). Basically this is an organization from the party leaders which later sought backing from their group members by creating regional and local committees. Due to the fact that this organization was created on leadership levels and by government initiatives it has not been exempt from criticisms by other organizations and rural leaders (see FAO, 1991d, appendix 1). One of its important peculiarities is that is assumes propositions basically and expressly related to gender
grievances.
Notwithstanding the difference between this organization and those in Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela, its achievements and particularly the limitations mentioned by the Colombian rural women are not substantially different from those indicated by women of said countries.
Among the achievements of the ANMUCIC, the following may be mentioned:
a) its legitimacy before other rural organizations and before women themselves which has demonstrated that one gender-related organization is viable in the countryside and may attain its goals. International agencies have acknowledged its importance and have seen the possibility of repeating similar experiences in other countries;
b) the training of its members has enabled their being integrated with consulting committees from agricultural and stockbreeding entities in order to define policies and development programs oriented towards the rural woman. The group has trained 2,182 leaders and has performed promotional efforts with 7,865 women, approaching subjects such as the problems of rural women, administrative decentralization policies, agrarian legislation, project forming, productive techniques, conservation of brains and drinking water, forestry development, alternative communication means and popular press (op. cit. pg. 24);
c) technical and financial institutional support by government and international bodies (UNICEF);
d) linking up with productive projects that are aided technically by the Colombian Institute of Agriculture and Stockbreeding (ICA) and the Colombian Institute of Agrarian Reform (INCORA);
e) acquisition of skills and development by its members on personal, family and organization levels;
f) excellent reception to its moves, diversity of member agrarian organizations and diverse political trends;
g) perseverance and strengthening of the organization despite adverse judgments;
h) construction and solidifying awareness of gender among the members; and
i) respect and prestige in the eyes of other rural organizations.
The external limitations the rural women see in the functioning of their organization are:
a) excepting the above-mentioned support, most of the entities in the agriculture and stockbreeding sectors have not supported the organization. To the women, this is due to the feet that they do not consider a gender-organization as a valid group and that each body wants to work with their groups, methodologies and institutional offer without favoring women's involvement. Common problems to these groups are the persistence of an example of assistance that conceives rural woman as a passive recipient of the government technical assistance; a non existence of clear standards for the women's incorporation process to development; lack of access for women to government financial sources for productive project development and the freezing of financial support from UNICEF to the Ministry of Agriculture since December 1989;
b) cultural barriers which hinder the involvement of women outside of the domestic environment which exists in the Government and the community. In fact, in the beginning, women themselves were first to oppose the creation of a women's organization since it would mean their setting aside their domestic obligations. They also considered the relationship of equality among the sexes as too bold. It is also difficult to incorporate indigenous women due to the ignorance with respect to their culture, family organization and politics in their communities. It is said that indigenous women cannot be treated in the same manner as the other rural women, quoting an indigenous woman on one occasion, "...without permission from Chief, I could not accept any type of appointment" (op. cit. pg. 27);
c) lack of economic resources which has led to limitations for the promotion, strengthening of and training of the organization.
Internal limitations indicated by the women were:
a) training problems. Initially, the sexual education courses were very vulgar which provoked rejection by the husbands, families and even by many women. Furthermore, the training was centered on participation in political decision making, thus ignoring productive, businesses and development aspects and dynamics of the organization. Its coverage was scarce and directed by very few leaders thereby causing a centralized power situation;
b) difficulties of the leaders in terms of unfamiliarity of their real possibilities of being coordinated with the Government and the power of the organization. The links with other bodies and diverse obligations in the community hinder their management capacity due to the numerous commitments acquired;
c) many base committees are inoperable mainly due to the fact that the organization was formed from top to bottom. In this regard, among the women who participated in the research there was a weak sense of belonging detected as well as a very local vision of the problems and lack of knowledge of key aspects in the organization. The above, despite the fact that the research was conducted with one of the oldest committees in the organization;
d) the majority of the leaders who have husbands and children have faced many obstacles in attempting to make them change their attitude, make them prone to participate and achieve their support by delegating their domestic obligations;
e) involvement on a national level is weak on behalf of the department leaders. The level of self-management is limited due to lack of training, information and economic resources; and
f) excessive dependence on government and international resources which limits ANMUCIC's autonomy.
5.4 Conclusions and recommendations
Generally, women's participation in the farm administration and decision making in production matters is rare. In general, they do not participate in the allotting of family expenses. All of the aforementioned disregarding their active contribution in family production and family income.
They tend to make decisions when the matter bears little importance or rather when the person who makes the decision is absent. This in how certain conditions favor a feminine participation. For example when they are related to a decrease in the size of the farms, the decline of agricultural activities as an income-generation aspect, the temporary or permanent absence of the partner. In summary, in any situation where there is decreased importance of the agricultural activity in family life, and rather than for reasons of gaining power positions and autonomy, the rural woman is obliged to assume responsibilities that under normal conditions she could not, would not, and would not know how to assume easily. And here it is hard to determine which are the most appropriate verbs since it is more likely that all of them apply at once.
Women are excluded from participating but more than anything else from the decision making in cooperatives and other labor related organizations, fundamentally because affiliation is defined according to criteria reserved, in general, for men: they are the owners or the heads of the household.
Rural women's involvement in social and community organizations is also rare. In general, on one hand when they participate they tend to do it in manners which reproduce or broaden their domestic role. However, on the other hand, it seems that they are little interested in participating in areas other than their homes, which is influenced by various factors including the weight of their domestic duties which does not leave them with neither the time nor the energy to participate. A well-known concatenation: she does not participate because she does not have the time to, but she does not have time because her involvement is not a matter of priority. Likewise, men and social organizations sustain that they do not invite women to participate, not because they want to discriminate against them but because women are not interested.
Although many question the existence of sex discrimination, there is specific and solid evidence of such which limit women's participation and decision making in social organizations and in the community since the accepted rule is that the man is socially defined as the representative of the family and that the woman should not try to go beyond the domestic environment.
In various countries women's organizations have been set up, many times responding to economic needs and common problems although some are relatively autonomous from other organizations. Furthermore, over recent decades some feminine departments within federations or rural unions have been created. In mixed organizations, there is ever-growing feminine involvement, but there are strong barriers in their accessing directive positions.
The involvement of rural women in social organizations seems to take on common elements, even in different types of organizations and in different countries. At least that is what is seen by women who comprise organizations varying from the Bolivian Mothers' Organization, a Feminine Department in a Peruvian Rural Federation, a Popular Feminine Organization in Venezuela and a Feminine Organization motivated by the Colombian government.
As it may be expected, the discrimination is less towards women who are involved in mothers' organizations while those who participate in clearly-stated feminine organizations may be even ridiculed by other members in its own community.
In varying degrees, women indicated that their participation has produced favorable changes on personal, family and community levels. Personally, the contact with other women who are living in similar conditions has allowed them to learn to express themselves in public, overcome their shyness and become aware of their gender. In their families, they have achieved in getting their partners to support their participation, and on a community level, they have obtained recognition for their activities.
Despite the fact that women indicated these changes, they also confirm that the family and community place obstacles to their participation. Basically, domestic work leaves them little time to participate in these organizations. It seems that the family support women say they enjoy does not translate into a solid manifestation which would lead to, for example, Bolivians posing the redistribution of domestic work as a solution.
Although women's opinions regarding the family and the community could be considered contradictory, this contradiction is only apparent: it suggests that families and communities are making changes, but the modification of values and attitudes based on sex discrimination is a process that will take quite a bit of time. Women themselves feel as though they have progressed, but there is still much to do.
Not including the participants of the mothers' organizations, women indicated their difficulties in relating with the government and political parties. As for the government, they confirm that they tend to be discriminated against, that the programs oriented to them are assistance-related and that many time they feel manipulated. The cases analyzed illustrate very well this point. For example, in Peru the social benefits of the government are granted only to mothers' organizations, which has caused many "Women's Committees" to change their names to "Mothers' Organization.." In Colombia, despite the fact that the organization is motivated by the government with clear gender purposes, women confirm that the other bodies from the agriculture and stockbreeding sector have generally barely rendered their support. Regarding the political parties, they feel that all, without exceptions, attempt to restrict independence and try to manipulate them to assume their "slogan."
Women from different organizations coincide in reference to productive environments. For women, they emphasize the capacity to generate resources and indicate that the lack of funds many times limits their organization's development. In fact, Peruvian and Venezuelan women feel that one of their achievements is having been able to generate their own resources through productive activities. Their problems and demands are centered on: access to credit, technical assistance, training for productive projects, leader formation, transportation restrictions and problems in commercializing their problems. In summary, those areas which strengthen their management capacity and which enable them to obtain their own resources thereby generating greater independence and autonomy for the organization.
It would seem that the desire for independence and autonomy is a matter that is very clear for women, and specifically regarding the government and political parties.
Naturally, not all of the difficulties originate from external factors. Within their organizations, women highlight that the generation of new leaders is rare and it is related to their lack of education and training. The problem of the low turnover of the leaders seems to be associated with the difficulties of communication between the leaders and the group's membership, and among its members in different communities. Their lack of adequate communication channels becomes an important obstacle for their operation and development.
In summary, the participation of women of rural areas faces a series of obstacles which are probably common to the majority of the countries of the Region and which are related to a culture that relegates women to the domestic area. Such belief penetrates the institutions, communities, and even the women themselves who often see themselves as inferior to men. In this accord, whatever action destined to strengthening the involvement of rural women must consider a global action that not only includes women but also their families, the rest of the organizations and the community as a whole. Such actions should be subject, previously, to in-depth studies by which the socioeconomic and cultural factors may be clarified which condition their participation and the different manner in which said factors act according to "the type of rural woman."

Chapter 6: Law and rural women
Current legislation commonly limits women's capacity and independence in their decision making. This discrimination has a cultural origin which grants men the public-related activities while conceding women the private one; thus men assume the representation of women in the public arena.
6.1. The legislation and rural women
In general terms, this aspect is equally applied to women. Nevertheless, for rural women it presents some specific aspects caused mainly by:
a) the fact that most rural women work without receiving salaries impedes their access to protection rules granted to working women in some countries;
b) the right to access land favors men while there are no special considerations for women who are heads of the family;
c) the above makes it difficult for rural women to obtain capital and/or access credit, thereby obstructing their gaining better opportunities in an economic and agricultural-productive aspects (Errázuriz, 1987).
One of the most serious problems in the rural sector is law inefficiency. In this respect, there is a general unawareness of the laws either for both the farmer and the reinforcement officials. Furthermore, customs constitute a parallel rule which reinforce women's subordination (FAO, 1990a). Hence, this is how many people responsible for awarding the land only consider men as heads of the family, even though the agricultural legislation does not stipulate such discrimination. Another common practice which bypasses the legal precept: ''equal work, equal pay" which results in women receiving inferior salaries although performing the same tasks as men (FAO, 1990b).
Upon analyzing the legal situation of rural women in four Latin American countries (Chile, Guatemala, Peru and the Dominican Republic), Alvear (1987) illustrates the same which, although in varying degrees, affects all of the Regional countries. According to the author, discriminatory rules affecting women are not posed in the Constitution of these countries since all of them acknowledge equality among men and women before the Law. However, women's legal discrimination, particularly rural women, is essentially visible in civil law and in a lesser degree in working and agrarian law.
In civil law, although to different extents, provisions applicable to married women and the family are discriminatory in all of the analyzed countries. In Chile, women married into a marriage partnership, most common in the country, acquire a relative incapacity which impedes them to act independently in public affairs. In this marriage, men enjoy authority over their wives and property and they represent and administrate all of the goods in the partnership including any that women might have acquired before marrying. These provisions affect both urban and rural women. The latter cannot execute any contract which concerns land acquisition and neither can they administrate or dispose of land and/or property they had before marrying. The same applies to their access to credits and production supplies.
In Chile, since 1934, there is a norm within the marriage partnership system called "separate property" for married women. This rule implies that partnership marriages in which women are employed or perform any profession, occupation or job, separate from their husband, are considered as marriages with separation of marital property^15. Therefore, women are not obliged to share her benefits obtained from such activities. According to Alvear, generally this condition does not apply to rural women for two major reasons: a) the tasks that these women perform are not usually compensated, and b) should they perform any work, it is carried out jointly with their husbands; and, according to the law, such a work must be conducted independently from the husband. If such work is conducted jointly by the couple, then the husband, in charge of the joint property, manages the properties. Furthermore, the husband can ban his wife from working and she is forced to follow him wherever he
might decide to live.
^15 The separation of marital property can be total or partial. If total, the woman is fully capable of managing it; if partial, she can only manage the property defined for such purpose.
In Chile there is another marriage system: separation of marital property. In this system, women are fully capable of managing their goods and properties since the husband has no authority over her and her property. Nevertheless, the authority of the husband over his wife and her property only applies to this aspect. According to the author, in reality, in the case of rural women, marriages containing the separation of marital property system is not applicable. If a woman were to marry into this system, her husband would hold a series of rights over her: "...she must obey him, must follow him wherever chooses to reside and he may prohibit her from performing any type of work" (op. cit., pg. 151).
In the Dominican Republic, a similar situation occurs: the husband manages the marital property even if the marriage contains a separation of marital property. Additionally, there are other systems: "common", normal, and the "dowry" where the woman supplies a dowry in order to afford the cost incurred in the wedding. The husband manages the property provided as dowry and receives the profits thereof. However, an agreement can be reached with the woman so that she can receive part of the income for her personal expenses.
In Peru, the most common type of marriage corresponds to possessing joint property in marriage with both spouses as representatives. Each spouse manages his/her own property which is divided between them when they separate or divorce. In this way, Peruvian women face no legal obstacles to acquire land or supplies and they are fully capable of executing any type of contract regarding their property. Nevertheless, agrarian legislation denies single or married women to own land since, in order to access land ownership, there has to be a "head of the family" who is considered to be the man.
Guatemala, similar to Peru, bears the same type of joint property marriage as the normal marital system. However, in this case the property is managed by the husband. There is no law impeding married women to acquire land or supplies. However, provisions granting the husband superiority over the wife does cause difficulties. There are some express legal provisions that maintain women's roles as being responsible for domestic tasks and child care, and she could even be forced to stay at home if her husband were to deem necessary.
Regarding labor rights, the legislation of the studied countries have some provisions protecting women in that they prohibit women to perform work under specific conditions; such as, work that is performed at night, dangerous, unhealthy, performed in mines or underground. This may impede women to enter the working arena or at least limits their possibilities in both rural and city areas. In the Dominican Republic, for instance, women cannot perform, among others, ''tasks that require the use of physical strength in mills, moving devices or drive trucks or heavy duty vehicles'' (pg. 163). Obviously, these provisions impede women to conduct jobs that include modern technology and hamper their training for to use the same.
Finally, regarding agrarian rules, the author states that the most common practice is that the ''head of the family" as the beneficiary, a role which has been historically and most commonly conferred to men.
Provisions regarding inheritance rights also discriminate. In Honduras, women can be the beneficiary and be awarded land only if they are single or widowed with children and if their work complies with applicable legal provisions. In Mexico, women receive the "custody" of any right to the land that the son may have until he is 16 unless the widow has no male children or that the husband has made a will in her favor (FAO, 1993d). Women live with their partner in consensual unions must be included since, generally, they have no possibility to inherit any property from their couple even though agricultural activities were performed by both spouses (Alvear, 1987).
Legislators in may countries of this region have considered the problem posed by de facto unions of men and women and have provided legal answers for an extended situation (one must bear in mind that consensual unions are more frequent in Latin America and the Caribbean than in any other region) De facto unions are regulated and acknowledged in Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico (D.F.), Peru and Venezuela. However, in Mexico and Venezuela this provision is voided when a previous marriage exists, thus loosing its effectiveness for many people.
As de facto unions are legally acknowledged, agrarian legislation in Cuba, Mexico and Peru accept that either "partner" may inherit the land. However in Venezuela, despite the legal acknowledgment of de facto unions, the Agrarian Reform Law does not include this situation and, in such event, the woman can have recourse to the Law of Agrarian Shelter. All of this shows that, in some countries, agricultural legislation does not equal civil legislation. In Colombia, although there is no legal acknowledgment of the consensual unions, there are rules regarding this subject: labor laws consider the "partner" as the beneficiary of the retirement right of the assignor (a matter which constituted a win for labor unions); the Agrarian Reform Law also considers the "partner" as having the right to inherit the land should the awardee die (FAO, 1990b).
As stated above, it is very difficult for women to access credits: the policies regarding credit grants are based on the economic solvency of the person applying to such credits and legal provisions for property acquisition make it difficult for rural women to be considered as sound applicants by financial institutions. The only exception is Cuba where women receive equal treatment as men regarding credits by both cooperatives and personal property. In other countries various measures have been taken so as to overcome legal restraints. In Colombia, for instance, an attempt has been made to increase credits destined to rural women, changing mortgage security to the harvest of the fruits obtained from the credit. However, long term credits are still require mortgage securities (FAO, 1990b).
6.2 Recommendation regarding legal amendment
Case studies on the legal situation of rural women conducted in nine Latin American countries (Colombia, Cuba, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic and Venezuela) show that all of these countries have discriminatory legal provisions regarding rural women which must be abolished, thereby providing them with full rights, without regard to their marital status. Countries are also requested to ratify international conventions regarding women' s rights, conducting an evaluation of their legal and practical fulfillment. Likewise, it is recommended to elaborate an abstract of international treaties and agreements so as to spread their contents and scopes. More specifically, the following legislative amendments are proposed (FAO, 1990b):
6.2.1 Civil and family law
a) Regarding the husband's authority over his wife and her property established in civil law, those regulations conferring said rights to the husband are proposed for abolishment or amendments. This would translate into the changing of the "head of the family" concept to the "shared direction" of both spouses. The above leads to a revision of customary laws in each country which, sometimes, are even more discriminatory than written law. Said amendments apply particularly to Chile, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and the Mexican states of Durango, Aguas Calientes, Nueva León, Oaxaca, Guanajeto, Michoacán and Tabasco.
b) Regarding family law, regulations must focus on the fact that "Paternal Rights" are shared by both spouses and do not imply the superiority of the father over the mother, as is the case of Chile, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. In Cuba, it is recommended to legislate to increase the father's responsibility regarding childbirth, fostering the father's participation, and establish shared maternity leaves, if necessary. This recommendation could be applied to all countries.
c) De Facto Unions: it is convenient that legislation be applied in this regard in those countries where it does not exist, in both civil and labor laws and agrarian legislation.
d) Family Property: this consists of assigning a home and/or land for the family living and nourishment. No embargo can be placed on these properties, as they are nontransferable and inherited. Although there is no statistical information in this respect, when a country's law considers this matter (as does Cuba, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela) this law is not generally applied in rural areas since property can be mortgaged as a guarantee for requesting credit. This could also be due to ignorance and lack of knowledge. For these countries a study should be conducted which stipulates how the Family Property has been constituted and the data regarding such system's advantages should be communicated. Furthermore, this system is recommended for those families constituted by de facto unions.
e) Inheritance Rights: amendments should be made in order to protect the surviving spouse. This is particularly applicable in the Dominican Republic where the spouse has no inheritance rights and in Colombia where it is suggested to increase the surviving spouse's stake. In El Salvador, rules are proposed for the National Financing Law for Agricultural Land to guarantee insurance for the female spouse which should be entailed in a land adjudication certificate so that no debt is applied on the land received by the woman.
6.2.2 Labor law
The following rules are suggested for Labor Laws:
a) Prohibitive rules regarding women: in all the countries, except Cuba and Mexico, rules prohibiting women from conducting specified types of work based on the fact that they are weaker and, therefore, incapable of performing certain tasks should be abolished. Furthermore, it would be convenient that in all countries laws be enacted to effectively control labor law enforcement which consider severe fines when they are not applied.
b) Rules that protect maternity: maternity protection rules must be maintained; however, their conception must be changed to "family protection" rules. The above implies, among other things, extending the benefits to all women workers, including a "father's license" so that either the father or mother may make use of the same. Also, it should be recommended to avoid jobs which may damage women's reproduction organs and new law. should be proposed which tend to facilitate women's work without prejudicing child care and attention.
c) Rules regarding women working in agriculture: it is convenient to regulate norms of agriculture-related jobs in all the countries which were studied. This is because of the fact that said jobs are specially derelicts, particularly seasonal workers. It is also recommended to include all rural female workers as beneficiaries of said protection rules, more Specifically women performing temporary tasks. Likewise, the execution of a technical-legal study is recommended. Said study should lead to the forming of rules that protect women, men and children from dangerous effects of the use and abuse of toxic substances in agriculture.
6.2.3 Agrarian law
Regarding Agrarian Law, it is recommended that in all countries there be a union of the various agrarian rules into one legal body. Furthermore, primary school must be made compulsory in rural environments and there should be a search made for new ways to acknowledge the productive jobs performed by women including her in the social security services. Specifically, the following is recommended:
a) Access to land: excepting Cuba, the idea of the male head of the family must be eliminated from the legislation considering women as equals before agrarian law.
b) Access to credits: it is suggested that for the countries included, didactic manuals be prepared so as to breed awareness among farmers of all the rules in force related to credit awarding. Also, banking provisions should be incorporated to these manuals, particularly where there are specialized agricultural banks. Said manuals should be published and include information courses regarding their use which should also be translated into indigenous dialects whenever necessary. From a legal point of view, the practical application of said manuals must be studied in order to abolish or adequate some restrictive norms. It is suggested that credit norms require that a portion of credits be granted to women who fulfill the requirements. Furthermore, the existence of a guarantee fund is under study; said fund would help avoid the obstacles women face when attempting to access credits since they do not have guarantees.
One conclusion from the analysis based on recommendations from the studies conducted on the applicable legislation in these countries, could be that, as stated by Alvear (1987), legal discriminations affecting women, both rural and urban, are represented, basically, in the country's civil law. This is sex discrimination which affects other aspects of women's lives. To rural women, this aspect acquires great importance when considering their introduction into the productive sector since said legal discriminations become barriers impeding their access to land and credit, property administration and overall their performance as agricultural producers and/or workers.
6.3 Institutions related to women's situations
In Latin America and the Caribbean there are various, different institutions, both public and private, which include a wide range of ideological origins and purposes but which focus on women. However, this document is not intended to display a complete profile of the institutions operating in the rural environment. Suffice to say that many institutions have contributed to change the life style of many women; however, there is still a long road ahead before goals are met and a real social impact is obtained.
6.3.1. Government actions
In the majority of the Regional countries studied, government initiatives regarding women have existed for many decades and they mainly focus on health assistance programs, nourishment and on promoting associations for housewives and mothers. Generally, these programs were conducted by the Ministries in charge of health, social welfare or education. Nevertheless, the decade of the woman (1975 -1985) fostered the creation of specific organizations geared to the study and consideration of feminine problems. As a result, currently in almost every country there are public organizations and institutions devoted to these problems. For example, there are offices and departments for women in the Caribbean, Ministries and Secretariats in Latin America (FAO 1992b). These organizations have been modified many times since their creation and such variations are mainly related to government changes and redefinition of their objectives and tasks. Table 17 illustrates the situation that
some Latin American countries are currently facing.
According to Ellis P. (1989), in the Caribbean, in those countries possessing a national office for women, as is the case of the Women's Office, said institutions are considered as core elements to address problems related to gender differentiation, and as mechanisms to coordinate different programs tending to improve women's conditions. Also, said institutions act as catalysts between women, women's organizations and the government and therefore they are able to influence and assess government policies. However, to the author, a national agency does not always possess the necessary financial or human resources so as to adequately carry out its responsibilities.

These institutions handle rural and urban women's concerns. They have tackled obstacles that rural women face that are related to access to land and credits, technical support and training. They are aware that overcoming these problems is essential to incorporate women to development. In Honduras, for instance, in 1992 certain articles of the Agrarian Reform Law were amended to guarantee women's access to land as a direct beneficiary (Honduras, 1993). In El Salvador, by means of the "New Options" project, many women have received title deeds for homes and farming lots. Also, the beneficiaries of these programs may apply to a national financing program for the construction and improvement of their home (FONAVIPO) (Salvador, 1993). Costa Rica, with the Law for Women's Social Equality, 1990, included women as direct and indirect beneficiaries to land, stipulating in one article that the awarding shall be made to the name of both spouses, should they be married; in the woman's
name, if it relates to a de facto union; and to the beneficiary in any other event, either the man or the woman, (Costa Rica, 1993).
Although some policies and programs have been accomplished in order to increase women' s access to production factors, their elaboration and execution pose some difficulties in all the countries (FAO, 1992b):
a) Lack of specific policies to solve women's problems, particularly those related to agricultural and rural development. Also, economic and social macro-policies do not consider this as an important matter.
b) Generally, statistical and planning units do not focus on gender problems; therefore, there are no considerations for these in national plans or in information systems.
c) Generally, there is lack of sensitivity and awareness as to the manner of approaching the above problem within the Ministries of Agriculture and other public institutions. In some cases, a certain hostility has been felt with respect to including this problem. However, there is currently a more receptive atmosphere towards the creation of policies and some initiatives have already been generated; however the lack of a gender perspective has limited them.
Different ministries develop specific programs for women in rural areas and many of them receive technical and/or financial support form international organizations. Explicitly as an example, we could mention some projects recently conducted in some of the Regional countries women's Institute, Spain-FLASCO Chile, ed. 1993. Volumes correspond to each country).
In Panama (1993), the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development is developing a Fostering Program for Youths and Rural women and a Club for Housewives. The latter is focused on strengthening rural feminine organizations and fostering profitable productive activities.
In the Dominican Republic (1989), the Secretary of Agriculture is conducting a trial program for Productive Projects for Rural Women. The Dominican Agricultural Institute is developing a project called Promotion of Mothers, Associations in shantytowns on State-owned lands.
In Paraguay (1993), the Women's Support Department from the Technical Support Division, Agriculture and Livestock Extension Service from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, is developing the following projects (supported by international organizations): Women's Roles in Rural Development; Fostering of Women's Productive Activities (supported by UNIFEM); Care and Nourishment of Mothers and Children (supported by UNICEF). The National Welfare Office is conducting the Human Development Program and one of its main focus points is the promotion of women in the rural area (supported by the UN World Food Program, WFP).
In Ecuador (1991), the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock is developing the following projects (supported by the National Program of Rural Development from the Rural Women's Department): "Integral Development of Rural Women"; "Participation of Rural Women in Community Developing Projects" and "Appropriate Technology for Rural Women.'
In Costa Rica, since 1990, the Ministry of Education has been developing the project "Education-work-production for the feminine population in rural and marginally urban areas of Costa Rica." This project is financed by Holland and relies on the technical advise of the International Work Organization, IWO.
In Guatemala (1991), the Ministry of Agriculture and Nourishment offers credits and financing for productive projects such as training for home economics teachers. Since 1990, the National Institute of Agriculture Transformation included the Integral Development Department for Rural Women.
Finally, in Chile, the Agriculture and Livestock Development Institute (INDAP) from the Ministry of Agriculture has developed, among others, the following projects: "Support of Productive Activities of Rural Women" (by the INDAP and the IICA); "Training for Organizations of Rural Women" and "Workshops on Teaching and Training Rural Women" (by the INDAP and the Foundation for Women's Promotion and Development, PRODEMU) (Barría, ed. 1993).
6.3.2 Non-governmental organization action
These private, nonprofit organizations called non-governmental organizations have expanded and diversified their functions over recent decades. In addition to their providing humanitarian assistance and fostering social welfare, they currently encompass technical and economic aspects such as environment regulations, analysis and support of policies and alternate marketing. In rural areas, these national and international organization provide important contributions to development projects by means of technical assistance and financial transfer (FAO, 1994).
These organizations also conduct significant tasks in feminine promotion in rural and urban areas in the Regional countries. Nevertheless, despite their direct action in various areas concerning the population, they bear a limited influence over the creation of public policies. Considering the work and experience of such organizations, the collaboration between them and governments could and should constitute an important tool to develop initiatives favoring rural women. (FAO, 1992b).
Although these nonprofit organizations play an important role when approaching rural women's problems, their work load is even heavier regarding urban women. In Ecuador, for instance, in 1992 there were 65 non-governmental organizations registered; of which 14 covered rural affairs, 2 were specifically devoted to women and the others handled other areas but did include programs for women. In Costa Rica, in 1993 there were 34 non-governmental organizations; 4 were dedicated to rural aspects and only one specialized in women's concerns. In Guatemala, in 1991 there were 24 organizations for women's matters; 17 of these organizations were devoted to urban and rural aspects; 5 worked with urban affairs and only 2 were dedicated exclusively to rural areas Women's Institute, Spain-FLASCO Chile, ed. 1993. Volumes correspond to each country).
In Bolivia there are 136 institutions assigned to women concerns: 78% correspond to non-governmental organizations; 24% are dedicated to rural area aspects, 45% dedicate to both rural or urban concerns and 31% dedicate exclusively to urban concerns. Their action. are focused on health and educational aspects, while the agricultural and livestock sector comprises only 14% (Bolivia, 1993).
One can see that the privileged areas of concern for these organizations are centered in the urban arena, despite the importance that the rural population exert in many of them (the latter representing 40% of the total amount). To exemplify the aforementioned, one may recall some factors. It must be borne in mind that, generally, the projects conducted by these organizations depend on external financing. It has been even said that, as a rule, international organizations are informed of actions taken by these organizations; however, they must update the concept and institutional mechanisms so as to collaborate with them in a more comprehensive manner (FAO, 1994). Although no precise information is available, it could be assumed that most international agencies granting financing favor those projects focused on urban areas. This phenomenon is also perceived in public policies adopted by the countries of this region.
In most of these Regional countries, women have been incorporated, one way or another, in global development programs through various ministries and government institutions, particularly those created to handle women's concerns. Furthermore, non-governmental organizations have conducted, and still conduct, important activities in this respect. However, it would be impossible to assume that only one social worker could respond to the needs of all the women in this region: there is no organization with enough human and financial resources which could do this. In this respect, in order to incorporate women to global processes and outline efficient policies, joint efforts are needed among national mechanisms for women, the ministries in charge of specific aspects - particularly education, work and health - non-governmental organizations, women's movements, centers devoted to conducting studies, universities, etc. (CEPAL/CELADE, 1993).
6.4 Conclusions and recommendations
In general, the legislation in all the Regional countries entails discriminatory provisions with regarding women that are not contemplated in the respective Constitutions acknowledging equality between men and women. These discriminations appear in specific areas of the law, more specifically in the Civil and Labor Laws as well as agrarian regulations.
Discrimination towards women within the legislation affects rural and urban women in the same manner, yet for rural women it adopts special characteristics. Discrimination of rural women is mainly related to the type of productive activity in which they are inserted which impedes their benefiting from protection norms granted in some countries as well as having access to land.
If we include all of those provisions related to the ownership and administration of the property in marriage, rural women have difficulty obtaining their own capital which excludes them from the possibility of opening credits. This situation also limits their opportunities to improve their performance as agriculture producers.
Therefore, some countries have enacted, or are thinking of introducing, some amendments to their respective legislation, particularly with respect to women's accessing land and credits.
In rural areas, there is an relevant unawareness of the law by both the workers and employees in charge of enforcing them. In such circumstances, regional habits constitute a parallel regulation which reinforce women's subordination. Due to this fact, future legal changes should include a broad communication in rural communities and intensive training programs for employees, including gender aspects since, ultimately they directly influence regulation enforcement and fulfillment.
Regarding women's institutionalize, most countries acknowledge the importance of approaching women-related problems, both urban and rural. The above has materialized through the creation of specialized public organizations. Furthermore, various ministries develop productive and assistance projects geared towards rural women. However, there are still difficulties in including "gender" problems in macro-social programs where the lack of information on rural women and the absence of employee training projects play an important role.
Finally, with respect to Non-governmental Organizations, although many of them work with rural women, most of them focus on urban women. Likewise, the urban area, so typical of the Region, surpasses this scope. Nevertheless, considering that these organizations depend considerably on external financing, it would be convenient to establish a closer relationship between these Non-governmental organizations and the external sources of their financing in order to foster initiatives geared towards the improvement of the conditions in which rural women are placed.

7.1 The environment in the Region
7.2 Conclusions and recommendations
Chapter 7: The environment and rural women
7.1 The environment in the Region
Latin America and the Caribbean have vast amounts of natural resources, fertile soils, abundant water, mining, cattle, forestry and fishing resources which have yet to be exploited. This natural wealth co-exists with important environmental problems adopt different forms depending on the country.
Currently, the excessive increase in the population is related to environmental damage. Although the evidence confirms so, a more detailed analysis should be considered, proposed by CEPAL/CELADE (1993), which states environmental problems in rural areas vary depending on the country and even within the same country. In general terms, the following situations could be differentiated:
a) in rural areas bearing a numerous population, a trend to overexploit available resources has been observed;
b) in those areas where resources abound in respect to the population, the type of exploitation most generally does not match local demands, as it is orientated to markets that import raw materials and energy from these areas, frequently exceeding the natural recovery time of the resources. The latter worsens in areas selected for large-scale commercial production requiring an excessive use of machines and chemical substances thereby damaging hydric and soil resources, and affecting people's health;
c) in areas of old population settlements and where natural resources have a certain independence, unequal land distribution leads to under or overexploitation of the resource; and
The different colonization movements in productive an demographic borders have produced mass deforestation, river pollution and soil leaching (lixiviation). When biodiversity is destroyed and indigenous populations vacated - who historically have enjoyed amiable relationships with the environment irreversible damage can be caused in some areas. However, the main responsible agents of these problems are not the colonials, but the large companies that settle in the region. In Hogan's work ("Growth and distribution of the population: its relationship with development and the environment", CELADE, 1992) reference is made to the fact that "there is information supporting the fact that these settlements are mainly deteriorated by exploitation methods of natural resource. and the use of the land by large companies" (Pg. 73).
Demographic pressure is not the only cause for environmental problems. In all the areas where major natural damages have been caused and where a physical crisis on the infrastructure has been experienced, demographic pressure has gone hand in hand with the land's unfair distribution and income, production and consumption patterns which are incompatible with survival, lack of adequate policies and profitable businesses for the exploitation of resources. There are also some cases where demographic pressure has been absent: deterioration of forests and rivers in the heart of South and Central America have mostly become objects of intense exploitation projects of natural resources (wood, mining and energy sources). Environment-related problems facing South America result from major mining projects, form the construction of dikes and dams without adequate assessments of environmental impacts, and from the introduction of foreign species which are harmful to the ecosystem. Most of
the environmental decline in the Caribbean countries is related to large touristical initiatives.
Both women and men living in rural areas in this Region share the aforementioned environmental problems which primarily affect poor families. As it has been seen, economic development strategies based on resources imprudent exploitation are largely responsible for the deterioration of the environment. Currently, as a result of this, it is necessary to "... rethink the natural resource contribution to the Region's development and consider a sustainable development. This is to say, a development which considers economic growth objectives, social justice and environment conservation" (CEPAL 1990b).
The woman-environment ratio can be analyzed from a wider point of view which is living quality. It could be said that women have played a fundamental role in environmental problems when fighting living conditions and family deterioration, and when requiring improvements such as basic services, adequate homes, heath and education. Likewise, there are many who support the idea that rural women, from their direct contact with seed handling and use and by knowing and using the plants and species growing in the region and their properties have developed a greater awareness of the environmental problems and the need to preserve resources (FAO 1993d).
Rural women have been defined as a key element in sustaining the environment, mainly because of the role they play in daily and generation reproduction. In this manner, Karremans, Radulovic and Lok (1993) state that a sustainable agricultural production implies the preservation and restoration of natural resources and a sustained family working capacity from one agricultural cycle to the another and from one generation to another. Generally, maintaining this working force has been, traditionally, a feminine task regarding biological reproduction and domestic management. Also, family support is granted by social networks supported by women to which the family can access when in crisis. To sum up, Women knowledge of natural resources, sometimes exclusive (for example regarding medicinal plants), their role in maintaining the production and local community union and their performance as workers clearly attests to their active, indispensable role played in maintaining a
sustainable agricultural and cattle development. (pg. 224).
The relationship between women and the environment preservation is not very clear at first sight. For one, many women are not considered as real agents in the environmental area. That is to say, even though there are many women and feminine organizations that have worked in environmental problems in their own communities, most people do not perceive their action as part of pro-environmental actions (INSTRAW, 1993). Also, it seems that ecological groups and other similar groups tend to be urban. This apparent inconsistency may be due to a methodology which can hide reality: the fact that real actions are taken showing a favorable degree of environmental awareness does not mean that there is a clear consciousness. Furthermore, even though people perform such actions, it does not mean they are related to ecology movements. As a matter of fact, formal organizations are urban rather than rural and it would be an exaggeration to consider that urban ecology movements represent the
most meaningful movements.
The literature reviewed to create this document did not reveal empiric evidence regarding women's concrete actions to protect the environment; however there are several references with respect to the preservation of knowledge of natural medicine through the silent, non-registered action of many women and men in Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Aruba, Curazao and Barbados. Ecological awareness does not appear gender-related, rather as part of the learning process. In order to justly evaluate this factor one must bear in mind that learning processes in rural environments which are basically illiterate, are verbally handed down from one generation to the next; a process which takes thousands of years. In this manner, "advanced" agricultural practices have been learned, such as seed preservation for fruits and medicinal plants within rural families living basically set apart from main villages sharing a
common feature: illiterate parents (Lanz-Valdivia, 1990.) In this regard, studying and learning the methods and ecological practices of rural societies is considered of utmost importance by urban settlements, particularly regarding those of very distant rural villages, the most "developed ones." Today, they constitute the last reservation of ancestral knowledge that aided American man's survival without major environmental mishaps for the last 5,000 years in this part of the globe.
Likewise, one must remember that environment preservation is not only a matter of conscience, it could also be related to poor living conditions, and in previous chapters we analyzed that this situation prevails in this Region. This aspect explains how in Haiti and El Salvador natural vegetation has been destroyed in some areas in order to fulfill man's needs for fuel production for his survival. It also explains how many areas in Venezuela and Colombia, hills and slopes, have been deforested to provide the poor with an access to land. In both eaves, this phenomenon equally affects women and men.
Economic modernization processes in agriculture have seriously damaged both the environment and some social organizations articulated by specific production strategies. A ease study conducted in the Maranbao Region, Brazil (INSTRAW, 1993) pathetically reflects this situation. In this area, the exploitation of the "babacu", a small coconut palm which is the main raw material used in the combustible oil and soap production, had guaranteed, for years, the survival of many families. The harvest, breaking and processing of the "babacu" was always assigned to women, while men conducted agricultural activities. In the 80's, land owners closed in on the babacuais and destroyed them to cultivate grass. From that moment on, families who were dedicated to the harvesting of the "babacu" were persecuted. Violence provoked and lead to the killing of women, despite the fact that in the Maranhao state there are laws protecting the "babacu"
There is another problem related to the agriculture economic modernization: pesticides. Pesticides are chemical substances used to control insects, acarus, snails, slugs, illnesses and grass/herbs. Their nocuous effects are well known in the environment and human health^16.
^16 According to the WHO, 5,000 people die yearly as a result of pesticides and another 500,000 people are intoxicated annually (Weir and Shapiro: "The circle of poison", Valdes, 1992.)
Valdés analyzes the situation of female fruit workers in Chile. The study illustrates the effects caused by pesticides, commonly used resulting from agriculture modernization and whose use has increased over recent years. Between 1976 and 1986, pesticide imparts increased from $4 million to $38 million. Even though the use of these substances has spread in agriculture, the problems they pose are not limited to the area where they are used. As a matter of fact, their use is closely related to a process commonly known as "agriculture modernization", whose introduction and development is different in each country. However, generally speaking this process began in the late 40's and today has deep roots in production systems of hundreds of thousand of hectares devoted to the production of cereals, legumes, radices and tuberous plants, vegetables, cane, coffee, grass, flowers and fruits throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. These areas constitute "business" areas originating
the flow of millions of dollars a year.
Exposure to agrochemical is related to congenital malformations. A study conducted in Rancagua, an area dedicated to grape growing in Chile (Mella, "Congenital malformations prevalence", 1990, Valdés, 1992), states that in this region congenital malformations have notoriously increased. Compared to the rest of the country, the rate of multiple malformations is higher: 3.6/1,000 versus 1.93/1,000. The most frequent malformations are defects in the closing of the neural tube (anencephaly, myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus.) This study also states that exposure to pesticides for mothers/fathers has resulted in increased congenital malformations. The synthomatology related to the exposure to toxic substances used in agriculture is: vomiting, chronic migraines, stomach aches, dizziness, nausea and frequent fainting. This region consumes 60% of the total consumption of agrochemical substances used in the country, most of them known by their oncogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic
effects which have been proven in other circumstances, for example, women working with flowers in Colombia Valdés, 1992).
As per the author, one of the most constant concerns of seasonal female workers is the use of pesticides. Even though women do not actually apply these products, they perform tasks where such substances have been dispersed. Also, when they work in packing plants, they have to handle fruit to which agro-chemical substances have been applied. In this regard, a case study conducted in central Chile, detected that, regarding labor risks, 33 of the 44 women studied indicated the action of these substances (Díaz, 1991).
The damage provoked by toxic substances used in agriculture and the awareness of seasonal female workers could constitute a major contribution factor to improve environmental conditions. Nevertheless, labor instability leads to a syndical anarchy which impedes joint actions. According to the author, the battle against environmental decline should not be limited to temporary workers, but should also include at the least the population living in the proximity of agroindustries and the consumers themselves.
Finally, Valdés, states that Chilean agriculture modernization implies, in addition to the use of pesticides, the indiscriminate extension of artificial forests which is decreasing agriculture and artisan production of rural families: "... increased use of chemicals in fruit-growing and forestry as well as monoculture expansion and the increase of food and raw material sources required for productive activities has deteriorated working conditions, thereby affecting the health of workers and reproduction aspects as well as worsened rural survival conditions" (op. cit., pg. 246).
7.2 Conclusions and recommendations
The abundant and diverse natural resources in this region, coexist with serious environmental problems that depend on the country where they occur. In rural areas, these problems would be caused mainly by economic development strategies based on indiscriminate resource exploitation rather than by the rural population's actions Concerning the natural resources.
Economic modernization processes in agriculture and stockbreeding have seriously damaged the environment and human health. The use of monoculture together with the use of specialized machinery and pesticides is closely related to the impoverishment of the soil and water courses. , constituting an agricultural process that is not sustainable. Agroindustries in central Chile are a clear example of this situation: damages not only comprise workers directly related to productive tasks, mainly women, but also the population living near such areas.
It has constantly been said that rural women are a fundamental factor for environmental maintenance as they maintain the family and also have direct contact with natural resources. This statement is correct since rural women represent a haven of knowledge gathered over decades by means of a teach-learn process passed down from one generation to the next. It is clear that part of their knowledge has been lost due to the exodus of rural population to urban cities, but it is still possible to recover by means of research programs, information that is an important part of this ancestral understanding linked to an appropriate approach of human-environment relationship. In this respect, rural women would unquestionably play a primary role.

General conclusions
General conclusions
To conclude in a few brief lines a subject matter whose scope encompasses millions of women, men and children on a continent in full transformation is a difficult task. An attempt is made to salvage the main ideas which arise from this document submitting the conclusions of each chapter to the reader.
The first item that is interesting to highlight is that there is nothing less real to talk about than the "rural woman". The lives of women in rural Latin America and the Caribbean demonstrate great social, economical and cultural diversity. To refer to the ''rural woman" obscures this diversity, and it is more appropriate to speak of ''rural women".
The life of rural women certainly depends on her sex but is always deeply marked by a historical and socio-economic context.
Over the last 50 years, within the Region there have been very accented changes regarding the rural population and the agricultural sector: growing urbanization, decreased E.A.P. (Economically Active Population) dedicated to agriculture and the contribution of the agricultural sector to the total GDP.
The population in Latin America and the Caribbean today is largely urban. However, while some countries continue being quite rural, in others rural population is minority.
The urbanization process in the Region was developed impairing rural living, favoring the urban life style even within the rural areas.
During the crises and the so-called "lost decade" (19801990), the agricultural sector was less affected than other sectors. Although this is related to a certain absorption capacity of the agriculture sector, it is also important to highlight that significant quantitative and qualitative developments were produced in some subsections, and particularly with nontraditional exports.
Despite the above, the Region's agriculture sector has 8 double-facet characteristic: one modern and developed while the other is rural and poor. Its differences not only are due to the amount of resources they manage but also due to its productive logic and entry to global society.
In terms of future development, adequate profits in production of exportable, agricultural goods are foreseen, particularly tropical and subtropical nontraditional products, the production of temperate climate fruits and vegetables and the extraction of natural, renewable forestry and fishery resources.
Notwithstanding these encouraging points, there are some worrisome signs. For example, the poverty existing in the country and cities. The poor are principally urban but the population suffering from extreme poverty, or in other words, the destitute, live mainly in rural areas. Added to this there is a strong concentration of land ownership which has not been resolved by the Agrarian Reform programs. Furthermore, the distribution of land among those who do in fact own it is very unfair and is, to a great degree, comprised of small farmers. Another unfair matter is the distribution of training access, new technologies and credit.
Together with the land redistribution policies there should also be considered training programs and those of technology transfer and credit which would enable rural people to obtain adequate levels of production profits.
Rural women in Latin American and the Caribbean are multiple and diverse; they are everywhere and they work as mothers and agriculture producers but they suffer, under specific manners, from an illness that is very proper to the feminine condition which tends to affect women: the "invisibility."
In effect, the economic participation of rural women is underestimated in the official information sources therefore generating a vicious circle of an inferior registration in which at least the following factors intervene: Measuring criteria, instruments used, organisms and officials responsible for measuring the country's economic activity and, in many cases, women themselves.
In agreement with what happens with the E.A.P. of the Region, the feminine E.A.P. that is dedicated to the agriculture has decreased during recent decades. However, at the same time, to a certain degree, the total agricultural E.A.P, is becoming more feminine since women are taking charge of the family farms.
The role that women play in agriculture of the countries varies, and is significant in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador and Peru. The percent of economically active women who conduct agriculture-related teaks seem to follow the trend of the country: they are greater in countries where agriculture is more important. However, it is difficult to extract conclusions based on information which has already been shown as impartial.
Rural women perform multiple productive roles: they are unpaid family workers, paid temporary workers or permanent employees in the agricultural environment for national consumption or destined to exports, travailing salespersons and artisans in the informal sector of the economy.
Estimates from the International Labor Organization (I.L.O.) for 1988 indicate that the Region was made of: 32.5% of women were helpers in their families, 20.9% were self-employed, and 44.5% were paid workers. According to these figures, the activity that was most important to women is paid labor.
The incorporation of women to paid employment is associated with the economic decline of the rural families. In poor homes there is a growing dependency on the income that women provide. It is particularly important in seasonally labor-intense areas and where the activities are agro-industrial related. For example, women attained a 70% composition of the work force related to flower growing in Colombia; 60% of the strawberry production in Mexico; 40% of the tobacco work force in Honduras, and 52% of the banana workers in Jamaica.
Women are present in various productive activities, but their working conditions still remain extremely precarious. Despite their important involvement in the seasonal work force, this is not their access to a permanent employment. In Chile, for example, women comprise 52% of the seasonal work force devoted to fruit growing. However, only 5% are permanently employed workers.
Likewise, paid employment to women in agro-industries is characterized by the lack of social security and other benefits, as well as salary discrimination when compared to men, although this is not a general rule applicable in all countries.
There is a question that is difficult to answer: does rural women's incorporation, albeit due to family financial problems, become later a personal need for autonomy among the women?
Trade is another activity performed by a good portion of rural women and constitutes a relevant contribution to the total income of the home. There are differences between the commercial activities of men and women. Women conduct a larger number of transactions, yet selling minor items (generally products which result from their exclusive work), they have a limited action sphere and their sales tend to equal less monetary value.
Due to cultural and legal barriers related to the "invisibility" of women and which are shared by the different social actors - rural men and women, and officials and financial institutions as well - women are not considered as agriculture producers. Therefore, they conduct their productive efforts in an adverse context having scarce access to land ownership and credit options.
Culture reinforces the legal barriers and many times the law is replaced by customs; this is coupled with the fact that rural people and officials possess a general unawareness regarding the law. Therefore, the Agrarian Reform programs have defined the "head of the houses" as the beneficiary party which in real life translates into the "man" of the house becoming the owner of the land, although this is not explicitly specified.
As is with the majority of women on the planet, women in rural Latin America and the Caribbean develop productive activities simultaneously with their domestic tasks. In rural areas, women face much more severe conditions than those living in urban environments, often with little family assistance therefore they must add productive work which causes them to have a double and sometimes triple work day.
Despite this harsh reality, the changes necessary regarding equality among the sexes currently enjoy a more favorable condition, which is quite different from what happened in Latin America and the Caribbean some 50 years ago. This is mainly due to the notable broadening of educational coverage. However, such expansion has not been spread equally and there are specific differences between the rural areas and the cities.
It is worth noting that even in the country in Latin America and the Caribbean the idea that women should also be educated is taking root, unlike ideas of years passed. The fact that today access to education is related to the area of residence of the citizen rather than a gender factor constitutes a social progress. Consequently, the differences of educational levels are greater between urban and rural women than they are between rural men and women.
An important consequence in this cultural change in families is that, due to improved educational levels attained by women in the formal education system, training projects oriented towards young women have a greater chance of success. A priority goal should be the professionally training of the young, rural women with sights set on improving their entry to the productive sector and above all on preventing their migration to the cities.
It should be mentioned that it has been difficult to reach the aforementioned conclusions due to the fact that the available information regarding the rural women's access to the formal educational system is insufficient. Therefore, this point is very important to be analyzed from the census of the '90's and planning of the following ones.
The access of rural women to training and knowledge and the use of new technology is limited; therefore they are hindered in their efforts to becoming first rate workers. However, over recent decades progress has been made in the Region concerning this matter. Traditionally, rural women were offered courses which emphasize home improvement, but currently various countries are also offering them productive projects and in some cases, there are programs which are clearly oriented to equality between the sexes.
What should be done in the future is clear. There are many training program experiences oriented to rural women that were conducted by Non-Governmental Organizations and public institutions. The still pending challenge ahead is to take advantage of these experiences in an attempt towards mass initiatives which comprise the different elements of a comprehensive focus: consideration and respect for the rationality of the rural women themselves and the time they have available; strengthening their personal and organizational development, and technological incorporation by gradually incorporating these elements to their daily work.
The family is the main center of attention among rural women. However, it is much different than what it was. Today, Latin American and Caribbean families have fewer children and their birth rates have significantly decreased. While in 1950 women averaged having 6 children, today the average levels at 3.4 children. There are less children per family although annual births increased from 7 to 12 million for that same period. This translates into a relevant increase in the population in most of the countries.
The Regional process of decreasing the birth and mortality rates has been different depending on the countries which are found in different phases known as "demographic transition". While some countries - Bolivia and Haiti - are in an "incipient" stage, others-Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Chile, Cuba, Guadalupe, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico and Uruguay- are currently in an "advanced" stage.
Although generally the demographic transition is related to urbanization, the direct relation between these two factors is not the cause of such a phenomenon since some very rural countries are in the advanced demographic stage and others that are relatively urban are in the first stage of demographic transition. This suggests that other factors, besides urbanization, influence such transition; for example, socioeconomic and cultural factors.
The differences of the demographic transition are observed even within the countries, according to social groups and geographic locations. Due to the fact that the transition begins in the more affluent sectors of the community and then spreads gradually to the remainder of society, the differences are greater in those countries experiencing the first stages of transition.
It is important to highlight that rural women in Latin America and the Caribbean continue to have, on the average, more children than urban women. This does not consider the lower registration related to abortion which could be higher in the city. However, some of the rural women expressed that would have liked to have fewer children than they did have. This could indicate that the higher birth rate in rural areas in some countries could be related to the lack of family planning methods and sex education or that the idea of a smaller family is growing. From another point of view, this could be due to the declining living conditions in rural areas.
Rural women do have more children than do city women, but the infant mortality rate continues to be higher. Scarce economic resources within the families, the precarious hygienic conditions in the home, the still low educational level of the mother and the existence of cultural standards regarding the origin and treatment of diseases all contribute to the health-illness factor of children. To this, the higher fertility rate in these areas must be added, since an important number of the births originates from risky pregnancies. An in-depth study is recommended regarding production models which combine a high incidence of family manual labor, minimal handling of agro-chemical substances and a high degree and supplementary vegetable and animal association, in light of their contribution to better nutrition rates of the families and lower infant mortality.
According to estimates based on the behavior and the current birth rates, the Region will achieve a new fertility rate (2.1 children, as an average) during the second decade of the Twenty First century. However, countries going through incipient and moderate transition stages will have a time difference of around 10 years. In light of this, the extension of family planning programs could be a determining tool in reducing fertility. To the contrary, the current fertility trends in rural areas indicate that fertility will remain at levels greater than urban areas for many more decades. All are reasons to motivate rural family planning.
The estimates for all of the Latin American and Caribbean countries indicate that infant mortality will remain high in rural areas. The spreading of coverage of health services and massive vaccination and oral rehydration programs along with reduced births should be considered as a means to decrease the same.
Despite the persistence of demographic differences between rural and urban areas, one of the most important changes in rural areas is related to the family size and structure: on the average, just as was previously indicated, rural women have fewer children than before and in the majority they have formed smaller families. In some countries, there are more families of this type in the country than in the city.
Rural families in Latin America and the Caribbean are predominantly small, but there are many larger families. Their existence could be in response to the survival of poor rural families rather than to a choice of family style.
The female household head in rural areas is a phenomenon which has been sparking growing interest in those who study and plan this topic recently. The information for some countries reveals that between 11% and 19% of the rural homes are lead by women, but it is also a more typical occurrence of urban environments.
There is a close relationship between poverty and feminine leadership intervened by the inequality between men and women in their entry in productive activities. For this reason, if it is intended to decrease the intergenerational transmission of poverty the women home leaders must constitute a priority group to be addressed although it might not be on the same level as that in the cities.
As seen above, the structure of the productive relationships within the rural families is still based on labor divisions which are fairly gender and age governed and the man assumes the decision making and family representation. The different social actors, including not only men, women and children, but also the organisms and institutions which act in rural areas, have internalized productive roles that are gender differentiated and ranked, a fact which must be considered in any action designed to improve women's entry in productive activities and also the family operation. To reverse this order would require that women themselves question this fact; however, supplementary actions with the other actors must be considered.
As it has been indicated, women are actively involved in family production and contribute a good portion of the family income. However, they enjoy scarce involvement in farm administration and the decision making regarding production. This, from a gender perspective, bears greater importance, for which equality does not consist in women's participating in the work force which they have always done in some manner, but on their having autonomy and power.
Rural women's involvement in social organizations is also rare, particularly when it deals with administrative levels. Various factors affect this, all of them are interrelated in a vicious circle: little interest from women to participate, overload of domestic tasks that leave them with little or no free time, and cultural standards that relegate them to their domestic role that they tend to copy outside the domestic arena.
Over recent decades, women's organizations have emerged in various countries as well as feminine departments in federations or rural unions. However, there are no statistics available indicating how many rural women participate in the organizations.
Qualitative studies stating the organizations' opinions, indicate that there are faults and their diagnoses tend to be similar. They indicate that the fact that women are involved in organizations has produced favorable changes for them personally, in their family and in the community. The most outstanding ones are changes on a personal level since the family and the community are also considered as obstacles to their participation. This would imply that progress has been made in this regard, but there are still cultural standards which relegate women to their domestic tasks. Autonomy would appear to be a very important aspiration for rural women which is also reflected in their wish to be independent from the government and political parties.
The hindrances are not only related to external factors. Women who participate in the organizations mention failures in the forming of new leaders which brings about a low turnover on leadership levels. To this are added communication problems between the leaders and their membership and among members pertaining to different communities.
Women who belong to organizations propose demands which coincide with the aforementioned concerning their entering productive activities. These are centered on land ownership, technical assistance, training, transportation problems, marketing difficulties and access to credit. In other words, those elements which enable them to generate their own resources and obtain better management power and autonomy.
From all of this, it may be concluded that actions geared towards strengthening the involvement of rural women must consider global actions which include not only the women, but also their families, the other organizations and the community as a whole.
Generally, all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have discriminatory legal provisions towards women which affect those living in the cities and in the country. Such discriminations are not defined in the Constitution but in civil and labor laws, and for rural women, in the agrarian norms.
Discriminations towards rural women particularly affect their entry in productive activities - which generally prevents them from being sheltered by protection norms that some countries grant to working women - and their access to land.
Furthermore, the provisions concerning the possessing of and administration of the goods in marriage make it hard for women to have their own capital which will exclude them from accessing to credits thereby limiting their opportunities for improved performance as agricultural producers.
These problems have been considered by some countries where they have introduced, or are considering introducing, amendments to legislation, particularly in reference to accessing land ownership and credit.
In rural areas there is not only sex discrimination against women but also ignorance with respect to the law by both the farmers and the officials responsible for enforcing it. Customs constitute a parallel type of regulation which reinforces women's subordination. For this, legal amendments must contemplate a wide spreading of the law in the rural community as well as intense training programs for the officials including gender contents since, definitely, they are the ones who directly influence the enforcement and compliance of the law.
In the majority of the Latin American and Caribbean countries, the importance of approaching the problems of urban and rural women is recognized and has been expressed by the creation of public organisms specifically devoted to these subjects. Furthermore, some ministries have formed assistance and productive projects directed to rural women. However, there is still much difficulty in introducing the topic of gender in macro-social programs where the lack of information regarding rural women and the lack of awareness of the officials with respect to this topic play an important role.
Regarding the non-governmental organizations (N.G.O.) it is observed that, although many of them work with rural women the majority work with urban women thereby expressing favoritism to urban areas which is characteristic of the Region. Given that the N.G.O.s depend heavily on external financing, it is recommended to establish relationships with the N.G.O.s as well as with the financial agencies so as to foster initiatives geared towards the improvement of rural women's conditions in the Region.
Another important recommendation is to take advantage of the N.G.O.s experiences which, although they are not numerous, they are very interesting, and if they are well systematized they would imply intervention standards that may be reproduced on a larger scale by public and private organizations.
Today, more than ever, all changes will vanish if the environment is not respected and held harmless. Latin America and the Caribbean have many, diverse natural riches which coexist with critical environmental problems that take on different forms in different countries. In rural areas, these problems would be more due to economic development strategies based on indiscriminate exploitation of resources rather than to rural population actions on natural resources.
The economic modernization processes have caused heavy damages to the environment and human health, the above being related to factors such as growing deforestation, monoculture extension and the indiscriminate use of pesticides in agricultural production. There are many references made implying that this prevailing model coexists with sustainable agriculture practices carried out in isolated rural communities in many countries throughout the Region. In this regard, it is recommended to conduct a specific study which would identify more sustainable production alternatives which have been tried by communities in the Region and which could be used as a grounds to generate policies in this matter.
Literature has repeatedly defined the rural woman as a fundamental axis in sustaining the environment due to her role in family maintenance and direct contact with natural resources, and this is probably true. This would not be due to her sex rather to a millenary process of teaching and learning which has been passed along from generation to generation usually verbally (at least until recently).
Even when the bibliography referenced does not record many instances of specific actions taken by women in order to preserve the environment, one must not ignore those low profile labors, those that are not registered, those that are carried out on a daily bests in many countries of the Region by rural men and women, that are somehow focused on environmental preservation. A few of these are: the preservation of seeds and the handling of medicinal plants. Urban societies have to learn more about the rural societies while education must be directed to both sexes.
Definitely, the problems that currently face rural women in Latin America and the Caribbean are basically culture related. In order to tackle them, there must be supplementary, systematic and constant lines of action centered on causing an awareness of the gender aspect. These must be geared to both officials and public organizations, and rural men and women. Now, an adequate awareness cannot be separated from material actions which improve family production and income. The optimum interventions must unite productive efforts under a cultural view of equality among men and women.

Presentation
FAO has been conducting a number of efforts in order to present the situation of rural women around the world at the Fourth Conference Regarding Women, to be held in Beijing in September 1995. Their main effort was centered around a participatory method based on consulting individuals and the consensus seeking deeper knowledge regarding rural women at different levels and the diverse areas by which they are influenced.
In this effort, the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean (FAO/RLC) has motivated the establishment of various activities throughout the entire region supporting preparatory initiatives for the Conference. A few of such activities are: subregional seminars and workshops, national meetings, research works on rural women and their contribution to agricultural and rural development, programs for their benefit and restraints and problems that still persist. The above was performed so as to offer subject matters for reflection and to provide the necessary actions required in order to obtain basic changes for women and rural society: in short, generally the search for equality, development and peace.
This work "Looking towards Beijing 95 - Rural Women in Latin America and the Caribbean: Situation, perspectives and proposals" is the result of reflection and a call to meditate on seeking the road beyond Beijing.
FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean (FAO/RLC) called upon Consultant, Josefina Rossetti, sociologist, and also for the collaboration of Marcela Ferrer, sociologist with this endeavor. Also contributing to this effort are: consultant Isabel Valdivia, economist; Walter Lanz, sociologist, María Jesús Egaña, social worker, Sonia Antunes, sociologist all who worked under the coordination and organization of Vilma Aray, Regional Official for Women's participation in Development pertaining to FAO/RLC.

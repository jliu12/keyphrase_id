Reasons for the inclusion in the PIC procedure
Formulations of the substance which exceed 600 g a.i./l are included because of their acute hazard classification and concern as to their impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries (Fifth meeting of the Joint Expert Group).
There are several reports that the agricultural use of methamidophos causes health problems (China, Hong Kong, Korea). In the USA, methamidophos ranked second in percentage of cases displaying signs of life-threatening symptoms among occupational Poison Control Center cases, (see Annex 1).
In a study conducted by US-EPA regarding acute worker exposure risk assessment under conditions of use in Indonesia for chemicals of concern, a MOE-value (NOEL/Anticipated Exposure Level) of <1 was estimated for methamidophos. EPA generally considers a MOE of lower than 100 to present an unacceptable risk. (FAO Jakarta, 1996)
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country when determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of methamidophos should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluations. (IPCS. 1993).
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protection when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they require full protective clothing, including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO, 1990)
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of methamidophos should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended. Pre-harvest intervals have been set in many countries. These intervals vary from 3 to 90 days (most falling within 14-21 days), depending on the crop, harvesting technique and the country.
In view of the high toxicity of methamidophos, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS, 1993; FAO, 1995)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control Actions regarding methamidophos have been reported by Indonesia, Samoa and Sri Lanka (see Annex 2).
Liquid formulations with 40% or more methamidiphos are restricted in the United States to use by certified applicators.
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that the substance should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
Indonesia and Samoa have indicated alternatives to methamidophos (see Annex 2). Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to its national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs in Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2:
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning (formulations containing 15 -100 % active material)
Packing Group 3:
harmful substances and preparations presenting a relatively low risk of poisoning(solid formulations containing 3-15% active material and liquid formulations containing 1.5-15 % active material)
Waste Disposal
All waste and contaminated material associated with this chemical should be considered hazardous waste. The material should be destroyed by incineration in a special, high temperature chemical incinerator facility.
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It should be noted that the methods recommended in literature are often not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.
Exposure Limits
Type of limit
Value
Food
MRL's (Maximum residue limits in mg/kg) in specified products (FAO/WHO, 1996)
JMPR ADI (acceptable daily intake) in mg/kg diet (JMPR, 1995)
First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes, wash affected skin with soap and water, and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under the surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulphate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days. (IPCS, 1986)

2. Toxicity
2.1 General
Mode of action
Methamidophos affects the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for normal nerve impulse transmission.
Uptake
Methamidophos can be absorbed following ingestion, inhalation and skin contact.
Metabolism
Biotransformation in mammals results in the formation of metabolites that are toxicologically insignificant (IPCS, 1986; IPCS, 1993)
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase-inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the pupils, tears, salivation, sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue,
involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Respiratory failure or cardiac arrest may cause death.
Short and long term exposure
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure that may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment will remain.
Repeated exposure through inhalation, ingestion or through skin may gradually lead to signs and symptoms of inhibition of cholinesterase activity.
Excessive human exposure to methamidophos may cause delayed neuropathy. (IPCS, 1993)
Epidemiological studies
no data available
2.3 Toxicity studies with laboratory animals and in vitro systems
Acute Toxicity
(Tomlin, 1994; IPCS, 1993; FAO/WHO, 1993)
oral
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 10-50; in different test species
dermal
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 50-110; in different test species.
inhalation
LC[50] (a.i.; mg/m^3 air- exposure 4 hrs) 162; (rat)
irritation
Moderate erythema and oedema were observed in skin tests on the rabbit ear. The chemical is also irritating to the eye.
Short and long term exposure
The following levels were published as not to cause any toxicological effect; rat: 0.1 mg/kg bw/day: dog: 0.06 mg/kg bw/day; chicken 0.3 mg/kg bw/day. (IPCS, 1993)
A long-term study (500 days) on the effects of low doses of methamidophos on mice was conducted. Mice given 0.03 mg methamidophos/kg body weight still showed significant effects (reduced number of muscarinic receptors in the brain), which can be valued as an important influence on the central nervous system. (Tigges, 1994)
Effects on reproduction
In reproductive studies, several parameters were affected at relatively low levels. (IPCS, 1993)
Mutagenicity
Methamidophos was found to be non-mutagenic in bacterial and in vivo assays. (IPCS, 1993)
Carcinogenicity
There were no indications of oncogenicity in a mouse oncogenicity study or in a long-term toxicity/oncogenicity study on rats.
3 Exposure
Food
Use of methamidophos may result in low level residues; but there should be no health hazards if preharvest intervals are observed. (IPCS, 1993)
Since 1987 in Hong Kong, there have been numerous cases of acute poisoning following the consumption of green leafy vegetables imported from China. In Shenzen, where the bulk of these vegetables originates, it is strongly suspected that methamidophos has been used by some farmers and that the sprayed vegetables have been harvested too early before the residue levels have fallen to save levels. (Chan, 1994)
In the US, methamidophos was found at unacceptable levels in preschoolers diets in a 1989 study. The average intake as a percentage of the ADI was 5.763%. Between 63%-97.6% of 1-5 year olds were estimated to be receiving average daily exposures above the ADI (NRDC, 1989).
Occupational
Higher occupational exposure (mainly through inhalation and dermal absorption) may occur in the case of accidents or as a result of incorrect handling.
There are several reports on methamidophos indicating it may cause health problems during occupational use. In the US, methamidophos was judged third-highest among 28 pesticides on measures of occupational hazard. Methamidophos had the third-highest ratio of handler poisonings per 1,000 applications in California when exposures in mixtures were included, and the second-highest overall for field workers. Methamidophos ranked second in percentage of cases displaying symptoms or life-threatening symptoms among occupational Poison Control Center cases. (US-EPA, 1996)
In China, 27 provinces reported a total of 48,377 poisoning cases, including 3,204 fatalities in 1995. 15,300 of these cases were caused by normal agricultural use and not by accidents or improper use. More than 50 % of these 15,000 cases were attributed to parathion, methamidophos and omethoate (Shuyang Chen, Peipei Yao, 1996; Chan, 1996).
Environment
The population is not generally exposed to methamidophos in air or water.
Accidental Poisoning
Accidental poisoning with methamidophos may occur due to incorrect handling.
4. Effects on the Environment
Fate
Persistence
The half-life in soil is a few days. Degradation products are CO[2], mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide.
Bioconcentration
On the basis of data on the solubility of methamidophos, bioaccumulation would not be expected to occur.

Reasons for Inclusion in the PIC Procedure
The pesticide is included because of its acute hazard classification and concern as to its impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries.
After review by the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on PIC, it was decided that certain formulations of parathion methyl emulsifiable concentrates (EC) with 19.5%, 40%, 50%, 60% active ingredient (a.i.) and dusts containing 1,5%, 2% and 3% (a.i.) should be placed in that category. A typically used formulation is 50% EC which falls into WHO Class Ib, Highly Hazardous. Dust formulations were included for consideration even though in WHO Class III because of the great variation of concentrations and uncertainty over potential doses by inhalation, especially because formulations of this pesticide are produced by many manufacturers with varying degrees of control over the proportion of respirable particles.
Some reports attribute specific cases of poisoning to methyl parathion. These reports refer both to occupational exposure and accidental poisoning (See Annex 1, section 3 for details).
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country in determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of methyl parathion should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators, who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluation. (IPCS 1986, IPCS 1993)
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protections when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they need full protective clothing including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO 1990).
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of methyl parathion should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended.
Pre-harvest intervals should be established and enforced by national authorities
In view of the high toxicity of methyl parathion, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS ,1993)
WHO concludes that with good work practices, hygienic measures and safety precautions, methyl parathion is unlikely to present a hazard for those occupationally exposed. DNAs evaluating the use of methyl parathion in a specific country will need to consider whether the necessary precautions can be ensured in the country as part of the risk assessment of the use of the methyl parathion formulations subject to this Decision Guidance Document. (IPCS, 1975; IPCS, 1986; WHO. 1993)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control actions regarding methyl parathion have been reported by Colombia, the Congo, Indonesia, Japan, Sri Lanka and Tanzania (see Annex 2).
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that methyl parathion should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
No information on alternatives has been provided by countries taking regulatory actions. Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to their national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning, for formulations containing 12-100% methyl parathion
Packing Group 3
harmful substances presenting a serious risk of poisoning, for solid formulations containing 3-12% active material, and liquid formulations containing 1.2-12% active material
Waste Disposal
Avoid skin contamination and inhalation of vapour. Absorb spilled liquid and cover contaminated areas with a 1:3 mixture of sodium carbonate crystals and damp sawdust, lime, sand or earth. Sweep up and place it in an impervious container. Ensure that the container is tightly closed and labelled before transfer to a safe place for disposal. (IPCS, 1992)
Large amounts should be incinerated at high temperature in a unit with effluent gas scrubbing or should be adsorbed on vermiculite and disposed of in an approved landfill, if incineration is impossible. (IPCS, 1992)
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It must be considered that the methods recommended in literature often are not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.

First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes and wash the affected skin with soap and water, and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulfate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days. (IPCS, 1986)

2. Toxicity
General
Mode of action
Contact and stomach insecticide, inhibiting cholinesterase activity (Worthing, 1994)
Uptake
Methyl parathion is readily absorbed via all routes of exposure (oral, dermal, inhalation) and is rapidly distributed to the tissues of the body. (IPCS, 1993)
Metabolism
Conversion of methyl parathion to methyl paraoxon, the active inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase, occurs within minutes of administration. Both substances are mainly detoxified in the liver. (IPCS, 1993)
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase-inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the pupils, tears, salivation, sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue,
involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Respiratory failure or cardiac arrest may cause death.
(IPCS, 1993, Occupational Health Services, 1991)
Short and long term exposure
Doses of 28 or 30 mg methyl parathion a day (study conducted with 5 volunteers) caused a significant decrease in the cholinesterase activity in three subjects. (IPCS, 1993).
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure that may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment will remain.
No cases of organophosphorous-induced, delayed peripheral neuropathy induced by methyl parathion have been reported (IPCS, 1993).
Epidemiological studies
There are no epidemiological studies on effects related only to methyl parathion exposure
2.3. Toxicity studies with laboratory animals and in vitro systems
Acute Toxicity
oral
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 3400 in different test species. (IPCS, 1993)
dermal
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 40-300 in different test species. (IPCS, 1993)
inhalation
LC[50] (a.i.; mg/m^3 air- exposure 1 - 4 hrs) 34-320 (rats and mice) (IPCS, 1993)
irritation
The irritation potential of methyl parathion was studied according to the guidelines of the OECD. It was concluded that methyl parathion had no primary irritation potential. (IPCS, 1993)
Short-term exposure
Dietary, dermal and inhalatory studies with different test species show a dose dependent inhibition of plasma Cholinesterase. The NOEL Value was 01.1 mg/kg b.w./day in rats (oral) and 10 mg/kg b.w./ day in rabbits (dermal) (IPCS, 1993).
Long term exposure
Retinal and sciatic nerve damage at high dose levels (50 mg/kg diet) was observed in a rat study. (IPCS, 1993)
Effects on reproduction
In a three generation study with rats fed dietary levels of 0, 0.5, or 1.5 mg/kg b.w./day, there was reduced weanling survival, reduced weanling weights and an increase in the number of stillbirths at the 1.5 mg/kg b.w.. Some of these effects also occurred at the 0.5 mg/kg b.w. dosage level. In rats and mice, a single injection of LD[50] rates during pregnancy caused suppression of foetal growth and bone formation in the offspring that survived. These injections also caused high foetal mortality. The rats had been injected with 15 mg/kg b.w. on day 12 of pregnancy, and the mice were injected with 60 mg/kg b.w. on day 10. In another study, there were no adverse effects observed in the offspring of rats given oral doses of 4 or 6 mg/kg b.w. on day 9 or 15 of pregnancy.
No primary teratogenic or embryotoxic effects were noted.
(IPCS, 1993; Hayes, 1990)
Mutagenicity
US EPA noted limited evidence of genotoxicity. The results of most of the in vitro genotoxicity studies on both bacterial and mammalian cells were positive. IARC concluded there is sufficient evidence of mutagenicity in some cellular systems. In vivo studies produced equivocal results. (11,18,21,22)
Carcinogenicity
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in rat or mouse studies. The available data provide no evidence of carcinogenicity to experimental animals and no evidence that methyl parathion is likely to present a carcinogenic risk to humans. (IARC, 1983)
3. Exposure
Food
Residues are generally below Codex MRLs. Residues in leafy vegetables and some fruit (e.g. citrus) have been reported in monitoring data from several countries but these were generally less than 0.1 mg/kg.
Occupational
Skin absorption, and to a lesser extent inhalation and ingestion, are important routes of exposure. Mixers, loaders, flaggers, applicators and field workers are particularly at risk. Dermal, ocular and inhalation exposure can occur during mixing, loading and application, cleaning and repair of equipment, and during early reentry in treated areas.
In a US study, methyl parathion was among the first 25% of pesticides ranked on the most measures of occupational hazards and for which cases of poisoning were referred to Health Care Facilities.
In a study conducted in the Philippines, it was demonstrated that in the course of a normal spraying operation farmers are exposed to contamination of their clothing and potential dermal absorption. (IPCS, 1993; US-EPA, 1996; Forget, 1990)
Environment
Levels of methyl parathion vaporizing from treated cotton fields have been detected 12 hours (12.6 ng/litre) and 24 hours (0.2 ng/l) after spraying.
Accidental Poisoning
The analysis of 375 pesticide poisonings in Bulgaria during 1965-68 showed that 82.5% of all cases were due to organophosphates. Six of the intoxications were attributed to methyl parathion.
Sixteen cases (of a total of 118) of methyl parathion poisoning were reported in the lower Rio Grande Valley (Texas, USA) in 1968. Toxicity following dermal exposure was predominant. (/PCS, 1993)
A combination of dermal, respiratory and possibly oral exposure led to the poisoning of a rural family. Nine days after symptoms appeared, one 26-year-old man died and a 17-year old was hospitalized and successfully treated with atropine. Methyl parathion was applied inside the home to kill cockroaches. (Hayes, 1990)
In Parana State (Brazil), pesticide incidents compiled by the Toxicological Information Centre and Health Clinics noted 1,243 incidents involving methyl parathion between 1982 and 1991. (Dinham, 1993)
4. Effects on the Environment
Fate
Persistence
Half-lives in soil are in the range of 1 -18 days under laboratory conditions, degradation being mainly by microbial action and chemical hydrolysis, in aquatic ecosystems, methyl parathion is eliminated from the water phase with DT[50] values of 2 - 22 days via adsorption on organic substance and microbial degradation. Methyl parathion is rapidly metabolized by both plants and animals and it is not expected to persist. (Howard, 1989)
Bioconcentration
Methyl parathion has no potential to bioconcentrate due to the low log Kow and to its short environmental persistence.
4.2 Ecotoxicity
Fish
Most fish species in both fresh and sea water have LC[50]s of between 6 and 25 mg/l, with a few species substantially more or less sensitive to methyl parathion. (IPCS, 1993)
Aquatic invertebrates
Methyl parathion is highly toxic for aquatic invertebrates with most LC[50]s ranging from < 1 m g to about 40 m g/l. (IPCS, 1993)
Birds
Methyl parathion was toxic to birds in laboratory studies, with acute oral LD[50]s ranging between 3 an 8 mg/kg body weight. Dietary LC[50]s ranged from 70 to 680 mg/kg diet.
Bees
Methyl parathion is toxic to bees (LD[50]: 0.17m g/bee) (IPCS, 1993)

Reasons for Inclusion in the PIC Procedure
Formulations of the substance which exceed 500 g a.i./l are included because of their acute hazard classification and concern as to their impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries. (Fifth meeting of the Joint Expert Group).
Monocrotophos is included in the PIC procedure because of its high toxicity which could cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries.
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country when determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of monocrotophos should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators, who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluation. (IPCS, 1993)
In Germany, monocrotophos may not be handled by adolescents and pregnant and nursing women. Before its withdrawal in the United States, monocrotophos was a Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP) which could be used only by certified applicators.
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protection when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they need full protective clothing including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO, 1990)
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of monocrotophos should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended.
Pre-harvest intervals have been set in several countries and are generally in the order of 7-15 days for vegetables and potatoes, maize and citrus, and 28-30 days for other crops.
In view of the high toxicity of monocrotophos, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS, 1993)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control actions are reported by 3 countries (Annex 2). The only registered use in Malaysia is application by trunk injection. The two other reporting countries (USA and Sri Lanka) indicated no remaining uses, By a ministerial decree of June 1996, the use of monocrotophos in Indonesia was limited until June 1997.
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that the substance should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
The USA indicated bifenthrin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, pyrethrins, diazinon and permethrin as alternatives to specific uses of monocrotophos. Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to its national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs in Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
Monocrotophos must be labelled as a marine pollutant.
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2
serious risk of poisoning: 25-100 % monocrotophos
Packing Group 3
harmful substances: less than 25 % monocrotophos
Waste Disposal
All waste and contaminated material associated with this chemical should be considered hazardous waste. The material should be destroyed by incineration in a special high temperature chemical incinerator facility.
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It should be noted that the methods recommended in literature are often not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.

First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes, wash the affected skin with soap and water and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used; vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under the surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulphate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days. (IPCS, 1986)

2. Toxicity
2.1 General
Mode of action
Monocrotophos affects the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for normal nerve impulse transmission.
Uptake
Monocrotophos can be absorbed following ingestion, inhalation and skin contact
Metabolism
In mammals, the primary conversion products of monocrotophos are dimethylphosphate, O-desmethyl monocrotophos and N-desmethyl monocrotophos. N-desmethyl monocrotophos is more toxic than monocrotophos.
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase-inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the pupils, tears, salivation, sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue,
involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Respiratory failure or cardiac arrest may cause death.
The ingestion of 120 mg monocrotophos can be fatal.
(IPCS, 1993, Occupational Health Services, 1991; Hayes, W.J. and E.R. Laws, 1991)
Short and long term exposure
Repeated daily high level exposure may gradually lead to poisoning.
Several studies on occupationally exposed workers have been conducted in countries with a hot climate where workers usually did not wear protective clothing. In most cases plasma cholinesterase was inhibited. It was extrapolated that absorption of 20 mg of monocrotophos caused inhibition of Plasma AchE. (JMPR, 1993).
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure that may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment will remain.
2.3 Toxicity studies with laboratory animals and in vitro systems
Acute Toxicity
oral
LD[50] (a.i; mg/kg bw): 14 - 20 in different test species. (Tomlin, 1994)
dermal
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg bw): 112 - 250 in different test species. (IPCS, 1993)
inhalation
LC[50] (a.i.; mg/m^3 air-exposure 4 hrs) 80. (JMPR, 1993)
irritation
Technical monocrotophos is not irritant to skin or eyes. Formulations may be irritant due to the content of organic solvent. (Skripsky and Loosli, 1994)
Short-term exposure
Doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg bw (dermal) given for 4 weeks caused toxic signs and significant inhibition of cholinesterase activities. The dose of 1 mg/kg bw was a NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level). In rats, behavioural tolerance to monocrotophos was observed within 16 days of repeated oral dosing with up to 6 mg/kg bw per day. (Skripsky and Loosli, 1994).
Long term exposure
In a two years study on rats with dietary concentrations from 0.01-10 ppm the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) was equivalent to 0.005 mg/kg bw per day.(JMPR, 1991)
Effects on reproduction
The existing data about teratogenic effects are not conclusive. In a teratogenicity study in rabbits, monocrotophos was not teratogenic at doses up to 6 mg/kg bw/day, which was lethal to the mothers. (JMPR, 1993).
Mutagenicity
Weak mutagenicity in vitro. In vivo assays were mostly negative or rarely equivocal. (JMPR, 1993)
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were negative. (JMPR, 1993)
3. Exposure
Food
Monocrotophos is not usually detected as a residue in food in total diet studies.
Occupational
In a study conducted by US-EPA regarding acute worker exposure risk assessment under conditions of use in Indonesia for chemicals of concern, a MOE-value (MOEL = NOEL/anticipated exposure level) of 5 was estimated for monocrotophos. EPA generally considers an MOE of lower than 100 to present an unacceptable risk. (FAO Jakarta, 1996)
In a study conducted in the Philippines, it was demonstrated that in the course of a normal spraying operation, farmers are exposed to contamination of their clothing and potential dermal absorption.
An epidemiological study conducted from 1972 to 1984 in a rural district of central Luzon (Philippines) resulted an increase in mortality of 27 % only in the age and sex classes occupationally (rice growing) exposed. These years were a period of high pesticide use. Among the 4 most commonly used pesticides was monocrotophos. (Loevinsohn, 1987; Forget, 1990)
Environment
The general population is not generally exposed to monocrotophos from the air or water. (IPCS, 1993)
Accidental Poisoning
There have been several reports of accidental poisoning with monocrotophos due to occupational use or suicide attempts. (Hayes, 1990; IPCS, 1993)
In Parana State (Brazil) pesticides causing more than 10 incidents were analysed in 1990; monocrotophos caused 107 of the 412 reported incidents. (Dinham, 1993)
4. Effects on the Environment
4.1 Fate
Persistence
Monocrotophos has a low environmental persistence. It does not accumulate in soil because it is biodegradable. Its half-life is less than 7 days in soil exposed to natural sunlight. (Tomlin, 1994; IPCS, 1993; US-EPA, 1985)
Bioconcentration
Monocrotophos and its metabolites are not expected to bioaccumulate. (Farm Chemicals Handbook, 1994)
4.2 Ecotoxicity
Fish
Monocrotophos is moderately toxic to fish
LC[50] 48 hrs (Rainbow trout) 7 mg/l and bluegill sunfish (23 mg/l)
(Tomlin, 1994; Farm Chemicals Handbook, 1994)
Aquatic invertebrates
EC[50] 48 hrs (Daphnia) 0.023 mg/l (103)
Birds
Acute oral LD[50]s range from 0.9-6.7 mg/kg bw. Monocrotophos is extremely toxic to birds and is used as an avian poison. Monocrotophos may also kill birds which eat insects poisoned with monocrotophos.
Due to the use of monocrotophos, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 were killed in Argentina 1995
(Woodbridge, 1996)
Bees
Hazardous to bees (LD[50] 28-33 m g/bee)
(Tomlin, 1994)

Control Action:
The substance was voluntarily withdrawn by the registrant, effective July 30, 1989. This represented the deadline for the manufacture, sale and distribution of the product by the registrant. No remaining uses allowed.
Uses still allowed:
Reasons:
EPA's concerns with respect to monocrotophos primarily involved effects of exposure to non-target species, notably birds. Monocrotophos is very highly toxic to birds exposed on an acute oral and sub-acute dietary basis. Monocrotophos was determined to be the cause of mortality or was strongly implicated in a large number of bird kill incidents affecting a wide variety of avian species. Monocrotophos posed serious risks to birds even when application was performed in a manner consistent with label directions. Monocrotophos is also highly toxic to freshwater invertebrates. The chemical is an organophosphate and is determined to be a potent cholinesterase inhibitor. Therefore, applicators and workers are potentially at risk for acutely toxic effects. In laboratory studies on rats and rabbits, monocrotophos was found to induce maternal toxicity and developmentally toxic effects (runting), but no major teratological abnormalities, at low doses.

Reasons for Inclusion In the PIC Procedure
All formulations of this substance (except capsule suspensions) are included because of their acute hazard classification and concern as to their impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries.
The 3^rd Joint Expert Group Meeting decided to include all formulations of parathion in the PIC procedure except capsule suspensions (CS). The principal reason for actions regarding parathion and its inclusion in the PIC procedure relate to its high acute toxicity. The active ingredient and its most typical formulations fall into the WHO classification by hazard 1a or 1b. The draft WHO health and safety guide noted "there are more reported cases of poisoning with parathion than with any other pesticide currently in use". (IPCS, 1991)
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations actually used in each country when determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but some formulations may fall into a much lower category of hazard.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of parathion should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators, who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluation. (IPCS, 1991)
Use in the USA of formulations containing parathion as a pesticide must be carried out by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator, and no worker is allowed to enter a field treated with parathion less than 48 hours after the treatment. (US-EPA, 1991; FAO, 1995; IPCS, 1991; IARC, 1979; US-EPA, 1986; US-EPA, 1992; US-EPA, 1991)
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protection when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they need full protective clothing including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
Unprotected workers should be kept out of treated areas for 48 hours. (FAO, 1990)
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of parathion should be carefully managed to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended.
Pre-harvest intervals have been set in many countries. These are generally in the range of 7-15 days, but for greenhouse use they may be twice as long and, for certain fruits, may last up to 5 weeks.
In view of the high toxicity of parathion, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices. (IPCS, 1991)
In 1991 the use of Parathion was restricted by US-EPA. In order to reduce exposure, remaining uses are restricted: i) for aerial application by commercial applicators when wind speeds do not exceed 10 mph; ii) closed-system transfer must be used; iii) a 100-foot buffer zone must be maintained around water, roads and public buildings; iv) all treated crops must be harvested mechanically; v) early re-entry into fields is permitted only for scouting and irrigation and is limited to one hour in any 24-hour period; and vi) any exposure incidents involving workers, spray drift or wildlife deaths must be reported. Unprotected field workers should be kept out of treated areas for at least 1-2 days. (US-EPA; 1991,1992)
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Actions to ban or severely restrict parathion have been reported by several countries. (Annex 2). Twelve countries have imposed a total ban on the use of parathion; in the USA, use is restricted to some applications and in New Zealand the substance was voluntarily withdrawn by the registrant.
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definition of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that the substance should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
Alternatives were reported by three countries. India indicated fenitrothion and methyl parathion. The latter substances was also cited by Thailand. Sri Lanka reported the use of IPM strategies in rice to substitute the pesticide. Alternatives have been reported in literature. (Gips, 1990)
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to their national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs in Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices,
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 1:
substances and preparations presenting a very severe risk of poisoning (formulations containing 40-100 % active ingredient)
Packing Group 2:
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning (formulations containing 4-40 % active ingredient)
Packing Group 3:
harmful substances and preparations presenting a relatively low risk of poisoning (solid formulations containing 1-4% active ingredient and liquid formulations containing 0.4-4 % active ingredient)
Waste Disposal
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual. (FAO, 1996)
It should be noted that the methods recommended in literature are often not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.
Exposure Limits

First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes, wash the affected skin with soap and water and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under the surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulphate and pralidoxime chloride.
General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days. (IPCS, 1986)

2. Toxicity
2.1 General
Mode of action
Non-systemic insecticide and acaricide with contact, stomach, and some respiratory action. Cholinesterase inhibitor.
Uptake
Parathion is easily absorbed through the skin, as well as by inhalation and via the gastrointestinal tract. (IPCS, 1991)
Metabolism
Parathion is oxidised to paraoxon, a strong inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Product of degradation is p-nitrophenol.
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
Parathion is highly toxic and extremely hazardous. In man, an oral dose of 3- 5 mg/kg b.w. is usually fatal. Signs and symptoms of poisoning develop after a latent period and may continue to increase after exposure has been discontinued.
Signs and symptoms may include a feeling of exhaustion, headache, blurred vision weakness, and confusion. Vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive sweating and salivating may develop. The pupils are constricted. Difficulty in breathing may be experienced, due to congestion of the lungs and weakness of the respiratory muscles. Arrhytmias and cardiac failure have been reported. In cases of severe poisoning, there will be muscle spasms, unconsciousness, and convulsions. Breathing may stop, followed by death. (IPCS, 1991; IARC, 1979; Hayes, 1991)
Short and long term exposure
Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure that may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment will remain.
Epidemiological studies
No human data
2.3 Toxicity studies with laboratory animals and in vitro systems
Acute Toxicity
oral
LD[50] (a.i; mg/kg b.w.): 2-12; in different test species. (Tomlin, 1994)
dermal
LD[50] (a.i.; mg/kg b.w.): 50; rat. (Tomlin, 1994)
inhalation
LC[50] (mg/m^3 air- exposure 4 hrs): 50; rats (Tomlin, 1994)
irritation
Not irritating to skin and eyes (rabbits) (Tomlin, 1994)
Short-term exposure
Rats: up to 16 weeks duration showed cholinesterase inhibition at and above 5 mg/kg in the diet, no effect at 1 ppm (0.05 mg/kg b.w./day). (IPCS, 1991) Dogs: at 1,2 and 5 ppm for 24 weeks, slight but significant plasma cholinesterase inhibition observed at the 1 ppm dose (0.021 mg/kg b.w./day).
Effects on reproduction
Parathion produced embryocidal effects and foetal growth retardation, but not malformations, in mice and rats at doses that were generally below the level that was toxic for the mother. (IPCS, 1991)
Mutagenicity
No evidence has been found that parathion is mutagenic.
Carcinogenicity
IARC: Long-term feeding studies in mice and rats have been determined to be inadequate for evaluation of carcinogenicity mainly because of the short treatment duration or inadequate numbers of animals in each dose group. IARC concluded that the data were insufficient to evaluate potential carcinogenicity in humans.
NTP: The U.S. National Toxicology Program cites "equivocal evidence" of carcinogenicity in rats.
USA: EPA classifies parathion as a Class C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen). (US-EPA, 1991)
3 Exposure
Food
Residues are normally well below Codex MRLs (ranging from 0.5-1.0 mg/kg for fruit and vegetables). Extensive monitoring data from several countries indicate that the residues are infrequently found. However, there have been reports of residues in cabbage and mustard greens in Indonesia and frequently detected residues in vegetables in Mexico as well as intoxication and deaths from gross contamination of foodstuffs during transportation with parathion. (IPCS, 1991, US-EPA, 1996)
A trial on lemons in Portugal reported residues of 0.22 mg/kg 21 days after spraying. Trials in Portugal suggest that when parathion is used according to Good Agricultural Practices, residues in olives should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg.
Parathion residues in crude olive oil were on average 4.5 times the levels in the olives. Supervised trials in the USA on sorghum suggest a maximum residue level of 5 mg/kg. Paraoxon was detected in every sample. Parathion residues in cottonseed ranged up to 0.97 mg/kg in supervised USA trials. (JMPR, 1993)
Occupational
Skin contact, inhalation and ingestion are sources of exposure. Applicators and field workers handling recently treated crops are particularly at risk. Use by untrained and poorly equipped applicators can result in poisoning.
Parathion is the only pesticide for which US EPA has received reports of death resulting from workers re-entering treated fields or wearing contaminated clothing despite laundering. It has accounted for a significant percentage of crop worker poisonings in the USA.
During mixing operations, levels of up to 5.5 mg/m^3, that is higher than the TLV, have been reported.
EPA's analysis of reports issued by the California Department of Food and Agriculture shows that from 1980-1986 parathion ranked among the highest in reported rate of systemic agricultural poisonings among 45 selected pesticides likely to be used on the same crops. Poisoning from parathion continues to occur even though California requires the most stringent protective measures in the country. (US-EPA, 1991; US-EPA, 1996)
Environment
Environmental concentrations of parathion are generally low and will be no hazard to human health. In Germany concentrations up to 320 ng/l have been detected in rainwater. (BBA, 1996)
Accidental Poisoning
Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported involving applicators, field workers re-entering treated areas and grossly contaminated food. (IPCS, 1991) In Parana State, Brazil, pesticides causing more than 10 incidents were analysed in 1990; parathion caused 92 of 412 reported incidents.
4. Effects on the Environment
4.1 Fate
Persistence
Parathion rapidly hydrolyses in alkaline conditions (pH>10) and is hydrolytically stable under sterile conditions at pH 4 - 9.
Parathion is degraded in soils, plants and other substrates at a moderate rate, though such conversion may be initially to the more toxic metabolite paraoxon. Such conversion is especially true under dry, hot conditions. (IPCS, 1991)
Parathion has little or no potential to contaminate ground water. (Tomlin, 1994)
Bioconcentration
Parathion does not bioconcentrate.

Reasons for Inclusion in the PIC Procedure
Formulations of the substance which exceed 1000 g a.i./l are included because of their acute hazard classification and concern as to their impact on human health under conditions of use in developing countries. (Fifth meeting of the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group).
There are some reports of the agricultural use of phosphamidon causing health problems (see Annex 1). A few confirmed cases of human poisonings are also currently on record. (Ciba Geigy, 1994).
Registrars need to carefully consider the formulations currently used in each country when determining the risks of continued use of this pesticide. The toxicity of the active ingredient is high, but many formulations will fall into a much lower hazard category.

Protective measures that have been applied concerning the chemical
Measures to Reduce Exposures
Personal
WHO recommends that for the health and welfare of workers and the general population, the handling and application of phosphamidon should be entrusted only to competently supervised and well-trained applicators, who must follow adequate safety measures and use the chemical according to good application practices. Regularly exposed workers should receive appropriate monitoring and health evaluation.
In the USA, phosphamidon is a restricted use pesticide which can be used only by certified applicators.
(FAO, 1995; US-EPA, 1988; FAO/WHO)
Protection
Protective clothing as indicated in the FAO Guidelines for Personal Protection when Working with Pesticides in Tropical Climates (FAO, 1990) is required; a respirator should also be worn by mixers and when spraying tall crops. The use of flaggers should be avoided; if used, they need full protective clothing including a respirator. All equipment and protective clothing should be washed thoroughly after use; clothing should be laundered separately from family clothing.
According to US-EPA, when opening the container and when mixing, protective impermeable boots, clean overalls and gloves should be worn. Mixing, if not mechanical, should always be carried out with a paddle of appropriate length. When spraying tall crops or during aerial application, a face mask should be worn, as well as an impermeable hat, clothing, boots and gloves. All protective clothing should be washed immediately after use, including the inside of gloves (US-EPA, 1988).
Application
The manufacture, formulation, agricultural use and disposal of phosphamidon should be carefully controlled to minimize contamination of the environment. To minimize risks for all individuals, a 48-hour interval between spraying and re-entry into any sprayed area is recommended.
According to US-EPA, unprotected persons should be kept away from tall crops for four days and away from other crops for at least 24 hours (US-EPA, 1988).
Pre-harvest intervals should be established and enforced by national authorities.
In view of the high toxicity of phosphamidon, this agent should not be considered in hand-applied ULV spraying practices.
Regulatory measures
Although the chemical has been included in the PIC procedure because it is a highly toxic pesticide that is likely to cause problems under conditions of storage, transportation and use in developing countries, some countries have reported control actions that may be of interest when considering its use as a pesticide (see below).
Control actions are reported by two countries (Belize and Japan) where the substance is banned or severely restricted for use due to its toxicity. In Indonesia, the use of phosphamidon is limited until 17 June 1997.
Not all of the reports have been determined to be of control actions which conform with the FAO/UNEP definitions of banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. However, all reports are provided here since the FAO/UNEP Joint Expert Group on Prior Informed Consent decided that the substance should be included in the PIC procedure due to its potential to cause problems under conditions of use in developing countries regardless of the number of qualifying actions.
For further information on the control actions provided in Annex 2, contact the Designated National Authorities (Annex 3) in the country reporting the control action.
Alternatives
There are no alternatives indicated by countries reporting control actions. Alternatives have been reported in literature (Gips, 1990).
It is essential that before a country considers substituting any of the reported alternatives, it ensures that the use is relevant to its national needs. A first step may be to contact the DNA in the country where the alternative has been reported (see addresses of DNAs in Annex 3). It will then be necessary to determine the compatibility with national crop protection practices.
Packaging and Labelling
Follow FAO Revised Guidelines on Good Labelling Practice for Pesticides (FAO, 1995).
The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (IPCS, 1993) classifies the chemical in:
Hazard Class 6.1
poisonous substance
Packing Group 2
substances and preparations presenting a serious risk of poisoning
Waste Disposal
All waste and contaminated material associated with this chemical should be considered hazardous waste. The material should be destroyed by incineration in a special, high temperature chemical incinerator facility.
See FAO Guidelines on Prevention of Accumulation of Obsolete Pesticide Stocks and The Pesticide Storage and Stock Control Manual (FAO, 1996),
It should be noted that the methods recommended in literature are often not suitable in a specific country. High temperature incinerators or secure landfills may not be available.
Exposure Limits
Type of limit
Value
Food
MRLs (Maximum residue limits in mg/kg) in specified products (FAO/WHO, 1996)
JMPR ADI (acceptable daily intake) in mg/kg diet (JMPR, 1986)
First Aid
Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision and slurred speech. If these symptoms occur, the person should remove contaminated clothes, wash the affected skin with soap and water and flush with large quantities of water. If in the event of collapse artificial resuscitation is used, vomit may contain toxic amounts of the substance. In case of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied as soon as possible by careful gastric lavage. Do not induce vomiting if the formulation contained hydrocarbon solvents.
Persons who have been poisoned (accidentally or otherwise) must be transported immediately to a hospital and put under the surveillance of properly trained medical staff.
Antidotes are atropine sulphate and pralidoxime chloride. General surveillance and cardiac monitoring must be maintained for at least 14 days (FAO/WHO).

Further information in Tomlin; 121; 123; 122; 119; 154
2. Toxicity
2.1 General
Mode of action
Phosphamidon affects the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for normal nerve impulse transmission. An impurity of the technical product, gamma-chlorphosphamidon, inhibits mammalian cholinesterase 10 to 20 times more than pure phosphamidon (121).
Uptake
Phosphamidon may be readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, through the skin and by inhalation of spray mists and dusts.
Metabolism
In mammals, phosphamidon is metabolized mostly to polar non-toxic breakdown products.
2.2 Known Effects on Human Health
Acute Toxicity
Symptoms of poisoning
The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase-inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include a bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the pupils, tears, salivation, sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue,
involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Respiratory failure or cardiac arrest may cause death.
Short and long term exposure
A group of thirty-two people which was exposed to a phosphamidon spraying of 550 g/ha experienced conjunctival irritation and inhibition of plasmacholinesterase from 0 up to over 50% with complete recovery in 9 days.
A study with hens showed that phosphamidon did not induce delayed neurotoxicity (JMPR, 1986).

0.1 mg/kg bw/day
dogs:
0.1 mg/kg bw/day
mouse
0.15 mg/kb bw/day
(Gunther, 1971, BBA 1996)
Daily oral doses above 1.3 mg/kg bw results in symptoms of poisoning
Long term exposure
NOEL
rat:
0.05 mg/kg bw/day
mouse
0.1 mg/kg bw/day
dog:
0.1 mg/kg bw/day
(JMPR, 1986; BBA, 1996)
In a two-year study on rats with dietary concentrations from 0.2 to 80 ppm, the NOAEL was 0-05 mg/kg bw (JMPR, 1986).
Effects on reproduction
In a three-generation test of reproduction, parental generations were unaffected and there were no pathological changes in the tissues. Reproductive performance was normal. There were no significant differences in the number of new-born (Hayes, 1990).
Effects on litter size and pup viability were seen in a rat multigeneration study at maternally toxic dose levels, Phosphamidon was devoid of a teratogenic potential (JMPR, 1986).
Mutagenicity
In the mutagenicity studies, phosphamidon was negative in a number of in vitro test systems, except for one test on chromosome aberrations. Several in vivo tests on chromosome anomalies have been carried out in rodents. Reports submitted to WHO showed negative or questionable results, whereas literature data showed a positive effect (JMPR, 1986).
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies in rats were negative (JMPR, 1986).
3. Exposure
Food
No data available.
Occupational
Evaporation at 20° C is negligible; a harmful concentration of airborne particles can, however, quickly be reached when dispersed.
One case of poisoning has been reported in which the only recognized exposure was through the uprooting and cutting of shrubs that had been sprayed with phosphamidon 2 weeks before. The 50-year-old man had worked without gloves for only 1 day. In the afternoon following exposure, he suffered dizziness, repeated severe vomiting, and eventually collapsed. When brought to the hospital, he was sweating and showed excessive lacrimation. After minimum treatment, the patient regained full consciousness in a few hours, regained full strength after 2 days and recovered completely. (Hayes, 1991; IPCS, 1993)
Environment
No data available.
Accidental Poisoning
Two workers were accidentally drenched in 50% phosphamidon and six others suffered soaked feet and splashes to the arms, hands and clothing when a pipe burst. The workers immediately washed with soap and water. They suffered short-term gastric pain, headache and eye irritation; none required an antidote and all returned to work (Hayes).
4. Effects on the Environment
4.1 Fate
Persistence
Phosphamidon is not persistent.
Bioconcentration
Phosphamidon does not bioconcentrate.
4.2 Ecotoxicity
Fish
LC[50]-96 hr (rainbow trout, Guppy, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Carp): 3.2 - 600 mg/l (121;120)
Aquatic invertebrates
EC[50] (daphnia): 0.01 - 0.022 mg/l (Ciba Geigy, 1994)
Birds
LD[50]-oral (5 different species): 2 - 26 mg/kg bw. The substance can be lethal by dermal exposure. Available information indicates that delayed mortality of birds occurs after application of phosphamidon (121; 120)
Bees
Phosphamidon is highly toxic to bees. LD[50]: 0.17 - 0.32 m g/bee. It belongs to the group of substances most toxic to bees (Delaplane, 1995).

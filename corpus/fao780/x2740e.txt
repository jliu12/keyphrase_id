<title>THE ROLE OF WOOD ENERGY IN AFRICA</title>
<section>1</section>
1: INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Almost all African countries still rely on wood to meet basic energy needs. At aggregated level, woodfuels share an estimated 60% to 86% of African primary energy consumption, except in north African countries and South Africa, where the woodfuel contribution is less significant. Moreover, woodfuel use accounts for 90 to 98 % of residential energy consumption in most of sub-Saharan Africa.
In the future, woodfuels are likely to remain the major energy source in Africa; with the exception of a few countries, they are slowly being replaced by LPG or other energies such as kerosene.
Despite their importance, woodfuel data in Africa are very scarce and are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, which makes it difficult to undertake relevant :
 planning tasks (substitution side, supply side);
 impact studies of woodfuel use on the environment in general and on forestry resources in particular;
 forecasting studies.
Therefore, data collection and compilation efforts should be improved by following a unified methodology.
This could be achieved in three steps:
 compilation and analysis of all existing woodfuel data in Africa;
 definition of a new approach for collecting data at international level;
 and definition of a relevant programme for collecting data at national and/or regional levels.
1.2. Objective of the study
The global objective of the current study is to compile, compare and analyze existing woodfuel statistics in Africa. This analysis has a dual objective:
1) Quantitative analysis of existing statistics will enable the role of woodfuels in meeting energy needs in African countries, to be assessed. It will also improve understanding of the global trends of woodfuel use, their contribution to wood removals, and associated future environmental and energy challenges.
2) Qualitative analysis of woodfuel statistics will permit assessment of the level of uncertainty related to existing data, consistency issues as well as issues related to applying the UWET and defined uniformed tables. These qualitative analyses will also supply relevant indications and suggestions for improving the data collection process and developing a specific programme to this end.
1.3. Scope of the study
This study covered almost all 55 African countries, grouped into eight main sub-regional entities :
 West Sahelian Africa
 East Sahelian Africa
 West Moist Africa
 Central Africa
 Tropical Southern Africa
 Insular East Africa
 North Africa
 Non tropical Southern Africa
Data compilation concerned all available statistics for these countries during the period 1970-1997. Data collected from all the available materials (international, regional, national, and even specific studies) were presented using the Unified Wood Energy Terminology (UWET) in order to facilitate data interpretation and the comparability of results derived from different sources within each country, as well as among African countries.
Analysis of the data led to the composition of time series data derived from best estimates that were in turn a mixture of the best data available. These time series cover the period 1980-1996, for which a reasonable degree of confidence was assumed.
1.4. Methodology
The first step was to identify and classify the main international or national sources of woodfuel data available for Africa.
Secondly all the collected data were presented according to a uniformed presentation framework. This framework had already been defined in previously published documents on the role of woodfuels in Asia and Europe, and consisted of the following eight tables :
 Table 1 : Total wood energy consumption (1000 m^3)
 Table 2 : Total wood energy consumption as a percentage of total wood removals (%)
 Table 3 : Total wood energy consumption (PJ)
 Table 4 : Total wood energy consumption as a percentage of total primary energy consumption
 Table 5 : Consumption of energy from different types of wood : Direct and Indirect (1000 m^3)
 Table 6 : Consumption of energy from different types of wood (PJ)
 Table 7 : Consumption of wood energy in various sectors : households, industries, transformation and others (1000 m^3)
 Table 8 : Consumption of wood energy in various sectors (PJ)
Where relevant, and in certain instances, additional tables were also created in order to present the data differently :
 Table 1 : Per capita woodfuel consumption (m^3 /year)
 Table 7a : Total fuelwood consumption for the various sectors (1000 tons)
 Table 7a : Per capita fuelwood consumption for the various sectors (tons/year)
 Table 7b : Total charcoal consumption for the various sectors (1000 tons)
 Table 7a : Per capita charcoal consumption for the various sectors (tons/year)

 Table 14PJ : Total final wood energy consumption (PJ)
 Table 14(%) : Aggregate woodfuels final consumption as a function of final energy consumption
 Table 17 : Total final wood energy consumption (1000 tons)
 Table related to population data
The third step was to use this presentation framework to set up a new database based on best estimates available for Africa; this was the main output of the current study.

2: THE ROLE OF WOOD ENERGY IN AFRICA
2.1. Methodology used for constructing best estimates
Best estimates were adopted for the period 1980-96 on a country-by-country basis and by applying the following principles :
 Where consistent, statistics from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) and Environment and Development Action (ENDA) were generally given priority since they are derived from best national knowledge, or from field surveys;
 Since they are generally based on estimates and do not report sectorial consumption, FAO data were only used for data cross-checking. On the other hand, FAO data represented the only source providing figures on wood pulp production. Therefore, they were systematically included in the best estimates of black liquor consumption using the usual chemical pulp to energy conversion factor;^(1)
 Where consistent, the IEA data for 1995 and 1996, which were the only years where detailed woodfuel consumption could be processed (i.e., distinguishing fuelwood and charcoal as well as sectorial consumption), were reported in the best estimates figures for the 23 countries considered individually. However, the reference years used by IEA in formulating its estimates were also used for cross-checking;
 Simulations were processed on a country-by-country basis;
 Simulations are processed on a sector-by-sector basis (i.e., consumption is simulated first at sectorial level).
Given these principles, a specific step-by-step approach supported by expert judgment was then applied^(2) as follows :
 Where consistent the most recent data, or those derived from field surveys among all the sources of data, were given major priority in representing the reference data;
 Where consistent, national data were given a second priority level as reference data;
 Other historical data are adopted when they are consistent with the global trends presented by reference data already in the time series;
 The gaps in the time series are filled according to the following steps :
 Sectorial consumption (of fuelwood and of charcoal) for intermediate years (e.g. where data are available for only 1980 and 1990) is estimated using a compound series approach based on the calculated growth rate of total consumption within the two available observations.
 Consumption for other years (e.g. from 1991 to 1996) is estimated using a compound series approach based on the growth rate of per capita consumption within the two available observations. However, when the consumption trend seems to be inconsistent, a more adequate approach is adopted (e.g., comparison with a similar country, consideration of a longer time series, etc.).
 For countries presenting only one historical data or no data at all, estimates were made by applying per capita consumption or even calculated trends related to a country or a group of countries presenting similar geographic, ecological and economic characteristics. However, in a few cases, per capita consumption, the basis for estimating national consumption, was left unchanged for the whole time series.
Although it was generally possible to build consistent time series for almost all countries (except Saint Helena), it should be noted that data for some countries presented considerable uncertainty, including :
 Nigeria
 Gabon
 Equatorial Guinea
 Algeria
 Libya
 Egypt
 Angola (uncertainty on charcoal consumption)
 Malawi (uncertainty on charcoal consumption)
 Namibia
Woodfuel consumption in these countries represented around 150 million m^3 in 1995, i.e., 24% of total African consumption. Of this amount, Nigeria alone accounts for approximately 18%.
However, the level of uncertainty in these countries does not significantly affect the quality of African aggregated estimates. This means that if we assume a 20% uncertainty for these 9 countries, the corresponding gap would lead to increasing the uncertainty of African aggregated estimates by only 5%. Therefore, the best estimates presented hereafter might be considered a good first approximation of woodfuel use in Africa.
2.2. Analysis of biomass-energy issues and uses in Africa
2.2.1. Aggregate analysis
According to best estimates, total woodfuel consumption in Africa amounted to 630 million m^3 in 1995.Compared to woodfuel consumption in other continents (or group of countries), Africa was an intermediate consumer in 1980, 1985 and 1990 (Table 2.1).

^(*^) Except for Asia, where FAO data were reported in this table
Africa also has an intermediate consumption growth rate for woodfuel compared to other groups of countries (see table 2.1). Aggregate woodfuel consumption trends in Africa from 1980 to 1996 as well as regional trends are shown in figures 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.
On the other hand, Africa still depends heavily on woodfuels to meet energy needs. In fact, Africa has the highest per capita consumption (see table 2.2).

2.2.2. Sub-regional analysis
According to best estimates, African woodfuel consumption is characterized by the substantial contribution of the West Moist region, which accounted for 172 million m^3 in 1994, representing 28% of total African consumption (see table 2.4). This region's importance is due to Nigeria, which contributed about 20% of total African consumption (see table 2.3).
On the other hand, the Tropical Southern and East Sahelian regions are respectively the second and the third contributors to African woodfuel consumption, each accounting for 19% of total consumption. The Central African region contributes 16% of total woodfuel consumption.
Woodfuel consumption is highly concentrated in Africa. In fact, in 1994, the 10 major countries contributed around two thirds of total African consumption, while the 45 other countries contributed one third. These 10 countries are listed in descending order according to woodfuel consumption in 1994 (table 2.3). Sub-region 2 is represented by three countries in the top 10, while sub-regions 3, 4 and 5 are represented by 2 countries each.

2.2.3. Sectorial analysis
Analysis of the profile of woodfuel use in Africa reveals the importance of household consumption, which represented more than 86% of total African consumption in 1994. The industrial sector, which is generally related to traditional industries, contributed about 10% of total consumption, while the other sectors (transformation, commercial, tertiary, etc.) represented 4% of woodfuel consumption.
Examination of the consumption trends for each sector underlined a slight drop in the household share of total woodfuel consumption, from 90% in 1980 to 86% in 1994. These trends may have resulted from socio-economic changes in African society that have led to a proportion of residential energy uses (particularly for cooking) being transferred to informal tertiary catering. The analysis of sectorial contributions to woodfuel use and associated trends might not be systematically consistent given the relatively high degree of data uncertainty in other consuming sectors, particularly industry and transformation compared to data available on residential use.
To illustrate the point, it should be remembered that woodfuel use for black liquor was simply derived from existing FAO statistics of chemical pulp production using a defined conversion factor. Therefore, they should not be considered actual data. Additionally, while it was not possible to simulate figures for countries where reference data for industrial and other sectorial consumption were unavailable, this does not exclude woodfuel use by these sectors. Therefore, the effective contribution of these sectors to woodfuel consumption may have been slightly underestimated.

2.2.4. Analysis by area
The use of fuelwood and charcoal is closely linked to user location. In fact, the area of use (rural versus urban) for these two energy types is a major determining factor in utilization patterns.
Among the 5 different data sources used for this study, only two (ESMAP and Other National sources) provided a number of detailed figures on rural and urban woodfuel demand. However, the existing information could not be interpreted given :
 the uncertain quality of a number of data sources that addressed the issue;
 the important number of gaps that would lead to more complicated approaches and models for estimating missing values in each country;
 the many decisions to be taken in countries where there are no detailed rural and urban consumption figures;
 the time needed to develop this modeling approach and to validate the results in order to make them consistent with results obtained when developing the best estimates according to a global approach (aggregating rural and urban).
Clearly, the materials collected may be used to generate a relevant best estimate for rural and urban uses. However, the timeframe and objectives of the current study mean that an important issue such as improving knowledge on current and future woodfuel behaviour should perhaps be included in a follow-up phase of the FAO data improving process.
2.2.5. Analysis by woodfuel type
The importance of fuelwood utilization used to traditionally be one of the major characteristics of African woodfuel practices. However the social and economic changes associated with urbanization have led to a significant shift from fuelwood to charcoal. The future is likely to confirm these trends and therefore pressure on ecosystems will continue.
Table 2.8 shows the respective contributions of fuelwood, charcoal and black liquor to woodfuel demand, confirming the importance of fuelwood. Table 2.9 shows how the shares of each woodfuel item evolved during the period 1980-1994. While black liquor seems to have stabilized at a low level (0.3-0.5 %) of woodfuel demand, the charcoal share grew from 15% in 1980 to 18% in 1994 at the expense of fuelwood.
This is due to the relatively low growth rate of fuelwood consumption (1% per annum during the period 1980-1994), which is much lower than total population growth (2.8% for Africa during the same period) and even lower than rural population growth (2.1% per annum). This could represent a powerful indication of the importance of the ongoing substitution process even in rural areas, which will lead to a greater role for charcoal in meeting the energy needs of African people. As an illustration, charcoal consumption grew by 2.8% during the period 1980-1994 in pace with population growth.
As a concluding remark, charcoal will undoubtedly represent a major economic, social and environmental issue in Africa in the future.

2.2.6. Per capita analysis
Per capita woodfuel consumption dropped significantly from 1.08 m^3 in 1980 to 0.89 m^3 in 1994. While this seems to contradict previous analysis addressing charcoal substitution, it corresponds in reality to natural woodfuel consumption patterns as well as to the specific share of the major consuming countries. In fact, urbanization is generally accompanied by a decrease in per capita consumption because of social evolution and the specificity of urban space. On the other hand, the drop in average per capita consumption in Africa is a result of the increasing population share of those countries where per capita consumption decreased in the period 1980-1995 (e.g. Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya, Sudan, Mozambique).
The following table presents average woodfuel per capita consumption for each sub-region studied :

2.2.7. Contribution of woodfuels to total wood removal
Wood consumption for energy is the major contributor to total wood removals in Africa. Woodfuel accounts for about 92% of total African wood consumption. There appear to be no significant variations in this share during the period 1980-94 (see table 2.11).
On the other hand, the regional figures of woodfuel contribution to total wood consumption are globally uniform (generally over 90%) except for Non-Tropical Southern Africa, where this contribution only reached 76%. Additionally, these woodfuel shares generally remained stable in almost all regions in the period 1980-1994 except for Insular East Africa, where this contribution increased from 87% to 96%.

NB : It should be recalled that the only estimates available for roundwood consumption other than woodfuels came from FAO Statistics. Thus the figures related to the share of woodfuels in total roundwood consumption are derived from the best estimates for woodfuel consumption, and from the FAO statistics related to wood other than woodfuels.
2.2.8. Contribution of woodfuels to primary energy consumption
Traditionally, woodfuel consumption makes a major contribution to primary energy balances in the majority of African Countries, except the following nine countries : Djibouti, Mauritius, Seychelles, the five North African countries, and South Africa.
Woodfuels account for about 40% of total African primary energy consumption. During the period 1991-94, this share dropped slightly from 41% to 39.4 %, which does not appear significant given the uncertainty of woodfuel data.
On the other hand, the contribution of woodfuel to total wood consumption logically divides African countries into three different groups :
 North Africa and Non Tropical Southern Africa, in which woodfuel contribution to total primary energy consumption is low, ranging from 6% to 12% ;
 West Sahelian Africa, West Moist Africa, and Insular East Africa, where the contribution of woodfuels to total primary energy consumption ranged from 61% to 71% ;
 East Sahelian Africa, Central Africa and Tropical Southern Africa, where the share in total primary energy consumption ranged from 75% to 86% .

NB : It should be recalled that data related to primary conventional energy consumption were unavailable for the following 6 countries for the period 1991-94 : Eritrea, Botswana, Namibia, Saint Helena, Reunion and Lesotho. In addition, data on primary conventional energy consumption for Gambia, Somalia, Swaziland were unavailable for year 1992-1993-1994. Therefore the average share of woodfuels as a function of total primary energy consumption was calculated accordingly. However, the gaps related to these countries would not hamper the significance of the calculated average given their weak contribution both to conventional and traditional fuels. As for illustration, the contribution of these countries to African woodfuel consumption amounted to only 2.4% in 1993.
2.2.9. Prospects for the substitution of woodfuels by LPG and implications for the future
Analysis related to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption is restricted given the specific focus of this study on woodfuels. However, an effort has been made to gather data from the same sources as for woodfuel, i.e., IEA and ENDA statistics.
Although there are many gaps in the time series (data are completely missing for 21 countries), some major global comments can be hazarded.
The first major finding relates to the substitution process from woodfuels to LPG, particularly for cooking end-uses in Africa. Taking into account available data, Africa may be split into five different groups of countries, according to their LPG consumption level :
 The North African region, where LPG consumption represented 3.2 million tons in 1990, increasing 7.2 % annually in the period 1980-1990, and by 9.2 % in the period 1990-1995. Additionally, LPG per capita consumption was the highest in Africa, reaching 22.4 kg/year in 1985, 26.8 kg/year in 1990 and 37.6 kg/year in 1995;
 South Africa, which is one of the major LPG consumers in Africa with 0.240 million tons in 1990. However, while LPG consumption growth was regular, the growth rate dropped from 2.5 % per year in the period 1980-1990 to 2.2 % in the period 1990-1995. Additionally, LPG per capita consumption was significantly lower than in North Africa although higher than in other African countries, reaching 5.3 kg/year in 1985, 6.5 kg/year in 1990 and stabilizing at 6.4 kg/year in 1995;
 Cap Verde and Gabon, which are minor LPG consumers compared to the African total, but where LPG per capita consumption was the second highest after North Africa, with 16.6 kg/year and 11.8 kg/year in 1990 in Cap Verde and Gabon respectively. In Cap Verde, this is mainly due to the particular shortage of woodfuel sources which made dependence on LPG unavoidable; in Gabon, the reason was easy access to LPG owing to it's specific situation as an important oil producer;
 Mauritania and Senegal, which share a minor part of total LPG consumption in Africa, but where LPG per capita consumption is relatively high (4.5 kg/year and 4.6 kg/year respectively in 1990) owing to woodfuel shortages in the two countries. Also government policy in Senegal has been oriented towards LPG substitution for more than 10 years.
 The other 45 African countries, where per capita LPG consumption was still very low, amounting to 0.7 kg/year in 1990. The growth rate of per capita consumption even dropped from 5.7 % per year during the period 1980-90 to 1% per year in the period 1990-95.
If we wish to refer to countries that contribute significantly to total consumption, only the five North African countries and South Africa could be considered. These countries represent about 92% of total LPG consumption in Africa, and this share is even increasing slightly although the contribution of South Africa to total LPG consumption dropped dramatically in the period 1980-1995.

According to the previous analysis, LPG is assumed to be a minor contributor to meeting national energy needs for cooking purposes in Africa, except in North African countries. The historical trends of LPG contribution to final and useful consumption of cooking fuels (tables 2.15 and 2.16) confirm this assumption, despite efforts to boost the substitution process undertaken in many countries, particularly in West Sahelian Africa, and despite the environmental rationale for reinforcing this process.

NB : Kerosene was not considered in the estimates of cooking fuels because of the unavailability of data addressing specific kerosene consumption for cooking purposes (distinction between cooking and lighting in the total national consumption of kerosene is generally not reported in any national or international publication). It should be noted that kerosene plays a minor role in meeting energy needs for cooking in African except in a few countries.

In conclusion, woodfuel is likely to remain a major energy source and a determining environmental and development issue in Africa in the mid-term future and even in the longer term. This means that a relevant effort aimed at improving knowledge on woodfuel demand and supply will need to be made in the future, particularly through systematic data collection, compilation and analysis.
2.2.10. Woodfuel supply sources
Although information on the origin of woodfuels used is vital for planning purposes, this information is still very scarce. Furthermore knowledge on collecting practices versus the supply sources is very poor in Africa^(4). While some experiences have been undertaken in certain Countries, none of the consulted references has really addressed woodfuels from the supply side, except FAO data on chemical wood pulp which can be used to calculate black liquor derived consumption.
On the other hand, some other national and international sources provided figures on supply sources; however the data presented were very sparse and mentioned neither the methods used in approaching the supply side nor the exact definitions of the terms used. Therefore, the supply component of woodfuel use in Africa is among the major weaknesses of woodfuel knowledge.
2.2.11. The use of woodfuels and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Africa
Given the significant woodfuel use, it generally shares a major part of the GHG balance in Africa.
The following table shows the results of GHG emission estimates derived from woodfuel use figures in Africa. Details of GHG emissions by country and by type of gas are presented in Appendix 6.

Table 2.17 shows the importance of CO[2] emissions in the total GHG balance due to woodfuels, with around 680 million tons emitted in 1995. CO emissions are also very significant, exceeding 31 million tons in 1995.
However, in order to obtain more accurate figures of GHG emissions, it is necessary to aggregate emission data in terms of tons of CO[2] equivalent (TE-CO[2]). Detailed aggregated figures are presented as follows :

Within global woodfuel emissions, fuelwood use is once again the major contributor to the GHG balance. However, historical trends show an increasing share of charcoal use in total GHG, at least in the 1980s and 90s.

2.2.12. Socio-economic aspects of woodfuels
Woodfuels undoubtedly play a major socio-economic role in almost all African countries. Within families, women and girls are generally the most concerned by the collection and use of woodfuels for different purposes, particularly cooking, but also other productive purposes such as informal catering, brewing or even small-scale industries.
However, the economic role should be analyzed differently according to the woodfuel form. Most fuelwood is self produced and consumed, particularly in rural areas, while it is also collected in traditional ways and informally sold along the roads or on urban markets. Again, women are the major actors and fuelwood revenue is generally fully integrated into economic life.
Unlike fuelwood, charcoal production and marketing is more formalized. These activities represent a significant economic activity in many African countries and generate large employment opportunities in rural and urban areas.
If we consider a global average price of US$10/m^3 for fuelwood compiled from FAO charcoal import prices for the year 1995, which might be underestimated compared to the real pricing situation in Africa, the economic value^(5) of woodfuel uses would amount to approximately US$ 6 billion for the whole of Africa.
While the current study did not address the socio-economic issues related to woodfuels, these issues are certainly key factors requiring international information gathering and improvement or information generation at national level. As a first step, a simplified approach could be adopted to improve knowledge in this regard; subsequently the results obtained could be used to launch more localized pilot studies that could be extrapolated to the whole of Africa.

3:ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE WOODFUEL STATISTICS AND DATA
3.1. Introduction
African countries rely on wood to meet energy requirements far more heavily than most other developing countries.
However, while woodfuel utilization has traditionally been a crucial issue as regards its interaction with environment, development and social welfare, there have been no serious efforts in any African country to include it definitively as a basic sector in planning processes.
Given this situation, the collection, compilation and analysis of biofuel data, particularly woodfuel data, never constituted a priority for these countries, and past initiatives (surveys, studies) were more project-based and tended to be limited in scope from the following points of view:
 geographically (e.g. : limited area, rural or urban only);
 sectorally (e.g. : only a single sector such as residential, or a single end-use);
 historically (no serious consistent historical data allowing comparability of data and trends analysis).
In order to achieve state-of-the-art available woodfuel information in Africa, FAO has recently launched a study aimed at compiling, comparing and assessing all existing international and national data, and deriving the best estimate. In addition to international consultations, extensive consultations with country experts on woodfuel matters are being launched in order to validate the best estimates and come forward with relevant comments and recommendations for the next phase, which will address the improvement of woodfuel information systems in Africa.
3.2. Methodology and approaches used
In order to meet the objectives of the current study, it was necessary to adopt a step by step approach :
Step 1: Consultation and assessment of the main available databases and documentation at international level (FAO, IEA, etc.). This step should have provided a rough idea of the main issues regarding the compilation of African woodfuel data at international level.
Step 2: Consultation and assessment of the main available national statistics at FAO, IEA and consultant libraries. This step is very important as it will help to provide a more accurate idea of existing data at national level, and to identify the major weaknesses.
Step 3: Comparison of national data with the data included in the international databases in order to define a preliminary idea of "best currently available estimates". While these estimates are based on existing materials, the consultant's experience in Africa can help fill in the gaps.
Step 4: Presentation of the selected consistent data as well as the best estimates using the Unified Wood Energy Terminology.
Step 5: Identification of ways to improve data quality, and defining a relevant approach for the collection, compilation and presentation of woodfuel data in Africa.
All data sources are individually presented using a unified format and articulated in the following major tables :
1. Presentation of a time series (ranging at least from 1980 to 1995, and even outside this range where data are available, on global woodfuel consumption (fuelwood and charcoal aggregated on the basis of primary wood) using to model ("Table A.x.y" ^(6)):
 In terms of volume: (Table A.x.1 woodfuel consumption m^3 )^(7)
 In energy terms : (Table A.x.1: petajoules^(8))
2. Presentation of the contribution of woodfuel consumption to :
 National wood removals (Table A.x.2)
 National primary energy consumption (Table A.x.4)
3. Presentation of the supply side of woodfuel consumption : Table A.x.5 ( m^3) and Table A.x.6 (PJ). The figures presented are :
 Direct forestry woodfuels
 Indirect woodfuels (industrial wood residues used as fuel, black liquor, etc.)
 Recovered woodfuels
4. Presentation of the demand side of woodfuel consumption : Table A.x.7 (m^3) and Table A.x.8 (PJ). The different concerned sectors are :
 Households
 Industries
 Transformation
 Others
In addition, other tables were developed in order to record all original data collected. These tables are included in each individual appendix of the different data sources.
A specific effort was made in the case of developing countries, with one table used to present the figures recorded by the five data sources as well as the best estimates for each country, thereby enabling data consistency to be crosschecked.
The countries are grouped on a regional basis given regional similarities in interactions between the geographical location and socio-economic and ecological contexts, which are themselves closely linked to woodfuel practices. Eight groups of countries were identified :
 West Sahelian Africa
 East Sahelian Africa
 West Moist Africa
 Central Africa
 Tropical Southern Africa
 Insular East Africa
 North Africa
 Non Tropical Southern Africa
3.3. Description of the databases
Almost all the woodfuel data in Africa available at the time of this study were consulted and compiled. At first, compilation only concerned the two formal databases : the FAO database and the IEA database.
In addition, sources which could be more appropriately termed "statistics" rather than databases were also assessed. While these statistics presented a generally high degree of uncertainty, consistent statistics based on field surveys were also found and integrated into analysis in order to correct the other data or to fill in gaps for some countries. These data could also be used to complete the time series. Data assessed came from the following sources :
 ESMAP statistics
 ENDA/IEPE statistics
 Various national data
 Other international sources of woodfuel African statistics (African Development Bank, United Nations Statistics, World Resources Institute statistics, etc.)
3.3.1.The FAO database (FAO Forest Products Yearbook)
The data collecting approach
FAO publishes a statistical yearbook on forest products, including fuelwood and charcoal (production, imports and exports). The FAO database also presents aggregate figures of fuelwood and charcoal in terms of woodfuel equivalent (m^3).
The data published in this yearbook are theoretically collected through official channels by sending a questionnaire to specialized departments in the countries. However, given the poor data quality at national level, particularly on woodfuels, and the low response rate from various countries, this surveying approach has proved unsuccessful.
Almost all woodfuels in Africa are collected, transformed and consumed through informal channels. Thus such traditional practices limit prospects for handling statistical data collecting systems. Moreover, difficulties in observing woodfuel behaviour trends can hamper national capacity to provide regular updated estimates. Therefore the approach of annual data collection and compilation through international surveys seems inappropriate and a new approach is called for.
In order to present historical series, FAO makes simple estimates based on per capita consumption and population growth. However, the quality of FAO data appear uncertain for the following reasons:
 The approach used to fill the gaps is not documented in the statistical publications for Africa (although it is indicated in the electronic database that all the data on woodfuel production and consumption originated from FAO calculations).
 The exact origin of the annual published data for each country (primary data, derived from the FAO calculation, etc.) is not specified.
 The reference data used to derive the time series are not specified.
 In some cases, the same level of per capita consumption is used for the whole time series.
 In other cases, the global consumption of a woodfuel item (e.g. fuelwood) remains unchanged for many years.
Therefore, FAO data should not be considered definitive, and are permanently subject to changes from one publication to another in line with new data acquired or with possible changes in the estimating approach.
Structure of the database
The FAO database presents historical series of woodfuel use under three items :
Fuelwood data (distinguishing Coniferous from Non Coniferous)
 Production (assimilated to consumption) of fuelwood in terms of 1000 m^3;
 Imports of fuelwood in terms of 1000 m^3
 Exports of fuelwood in terms of 1000 m^3
Charcoal data
 Production of charcoal in terms of 1000 m^3
 Consumption of charcoal (assimilated to production while in some cases no consistent relation are noted between production-imports-exports and consumption) in terms of 1000 m^3
 Imports of charcoal in terms of 1000 m^3
 Exports of charcoal in terms of 1000 m^3
Aggregate woodfuel data
 Production of woodfuels (aggregate figures of fuelwood and charcoal) in terms of 1000 m^3
 Consumption of woodfuels (assimilated to production) in terms of 1000 m^3
 Imports of woodfuels in terms of 1000 m^3
 Exports of woodfuels in terms of 1000 m^3
Regarding woodfuel trade among African countries or with other non African countries, the FAO database is the only one which reports annual figures on imports and exports of fuelwood and charcoal. The data included on the database generally come from official country sources and can be considered as the formal declared figures, while figures on informal trade among countries are not documented anywhere.
In general, official trade in fuelwood and charcoal is insignificant compared to total African consumption. For example, charcoal imports totaled 57 000 tons for the whole of Africa in 1994 and 59 000 tons in 1995, while exports represented only 80 000 tons in 1994 and 78 000 in 1995.
Fuelwood imports amounted to 7 000 m^3 for the whole of Africa in 1994 and 45 000 m^3 in 1995, while exports represented only 276 m^3 in 1994 and 6 000 in 1995.
Although trade volumes in Africa do not represent a great issue, FAO statistics provide no detail on the originating country of woodfuel imports for each country nor on the destination of exports. This makes it is difficult to check the consistency of data submitted to FAO, at least for African countries.
For example, gaps between imports and exports might be considered consistent since charcoal imports to Africa and exports from Africa can be envisaged within the economic framework of charcoal trade. Conversely, this might not be true for fuelwood, where the gaps between imports and exports could be explained by possible data inconsistency rather than potential trade with other continents.
Approach for using the data in the context of the study
According to FAO definitions of forest products, fuelwood normally includes raw wood from the trunk and branches of trees. However as information in Africa tends to originate from demand, the term fuelwood has come to include all sorts of wood from different tree sources, including fruit trees. Charcoal could be viewed in a similar way as, again, data are generally available from the consumption side.
On the other hand, FAO statistics distinguish between non-coniferous and coniferous woodfuels; however, this distinction was not considered relevant in this study as it does not represent a key issue for woodfuels.
FAO data calculate woodfuel consumption as follows :
 calculation of fuelwood consumption (1000 m^3) = production + exports - imports;
 calculation of charcoal consumption (1000 m^3) = production + exports - imports;
 calculation of aggregate woodfuel consumption (1000 m^3) = consumption of fuelwood + 6 x consumption of charcoal^(9);
The results of data compilation were finally presented in the following uniform tables:
1. Main tables :
 In terms of volume (Table A.1.1 : woodfuel consumption : 1000 m^3, and Table A.1.1 Per Capita woodfuel consumption : m^3 /year).
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption as a percentage of total wood consumption (Table A.1.2 : woodfuel consumption as a percentage of total wood consumption).
 In energy terms (Table A.1.3 : Petajoules).
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption (Table A.1.5) in terms of m^3 .
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption (Table A.1.6) in energy terms (PJ).
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption by sector (Table A.1.7) in terms of m^3. However this table was not relevant for FAO since its database does not include any details on consumption share.
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption by sector (Table A.1.8) in energy terms. However, this table was not relevant for the same reason as above.
2. In addition, original tables were also included in the datafile :
 Total Roundwood consumption (Table A.1.1a ) in terms of 1000 m^3.
 Fuelwood consumption in terms of 1000 m^3 (Table A.1.FW).
 Charcoal consumption in terms of 1000 m^3 (Table A.1.CH).
3.3.2.The IEA database
The data collecting approach
The International Energy Agency (IEA) publishes a yearbook on conventional energy statistics in countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). More recently, IEA has started to publish non-OECD country statistics, including biofuel consumption statistics.
Biofuel estimates were made on a country basis for 23 African countries. Thirty-one other countries were grouped together under "Other Africa"^(10), while St Helena was excluded from estimates. This classification assumed the use of a unified elasticity and base year for countries included under Other Africa.
The IEA is not officially authorized to collect data from non-OECD countries. Therefore, it adopts various approaches to complete its biofuel database. Data are primarily collected from various national sources such as publications, statistics, studies, or even surveys when available. When these primary sources are not available, the IEA collects data from regional organizations (e.g. the South African Development Community [SADC]) with which it has an information exchange and collaboration agreement. As a last resort, the IEA uses existing data at international level (UN statistics, FAO, African Development Bank, etc. Table 3.1 provides details on the different sources and parameters used by IEA in estimating biofuel use in each country.
In general, the original data sources used by IEA do not supply details on the origin of the data (surveys, derived data, estimated or simulated data, etc.). Therefore, it is impossible for IEA to provide quality assessment of the data and also for this study to evaluate the individual data on the IEA database.
In addition, since the collected data only generally present a few historical figures for each country (or even a single figure), a modeling approach had to be adopted to fill in the gaps. This approach reconstituted the time series for the period 1971-1996 for biomass TPES (Total Primary Supply of Combustible Renewable and Waste).
Biomass TPES estimates are based on a simple modeling approach that employs three main parameters to reconstitute the time series :
 Urbanization growth, which is a defined factor.
 A country-specific elasticity factor that links biomass TPES to urbanization growth. The estimates were made using a changing elasticity factor within three different reference periods: 1971-78, 1979-88 and 1989-95. These elasticity factors were defined by IEA using expert judgement of the potential interaction between biomass TPES and urbanization growth in each country concerned.
 Reference biomass TPES data for a given year, extracted from national sources or different regional and international sources. While considerable effort was made to collect national primary data, many biofuels estimates were also based on African Development Bank data or UN Statistics, which are themselves completely derived from FAO data. In addition, as mentioned above, data series were calculated individually for 23 countries, with 31 other countries grouped under "Other Africa" because of the lack of individual biomass TPES data in these countries.
As the model presents a historical series for aggregate biomass TPES supply during the period 1971-1996, it was difficult to reconstitute the specific contributions of different biomass types, such as woodfuels. However, detailed data presented for 1995 and 1996 allowed the specific contributions of fuelwood, charcoal, vegetal wastes and other biomass fuels to be distinguished and sectorial consumption to be divided up.
Structure of the database
One issue of the IEA publication including biomass data for 1995 is currently available, and the issue for 1996 is under publication.
These publications provide two types of data, all of which are presented in terms of TOE (tons of oil equivalent^(11)) :
 A time series on primary supply of combustible renewable and waste (Biomass TPES). These series cover data from 1971 to 1996, but do not provide detailed figures of the different wooduels considered or the sectorial consumption shares.
 Detailed data on biofuel use by type (fuelwood, charcoal, etc.) and by sector (transformation, energy and industry sector, residential, and non-specified) for the years 1995 and 1996.
Approach for using the data in the context of the study
Given the specific format of data presentation on the IEA database, it was not possible to present a complete historical series that fitted formatting requirements. Therefore, only data recorded for 1995 and 1996 were finally organized according to the study format:
1. Main tables :
 Fuelwood consumption for 1995 and 1996 in terms of m^3, tons and PJ (Table A.2.1a / A.2.3a);
 Charcoal consumption for 1995 and 1996 in terms of m^3 (primary wood used for carbonization), tons and PJ (Table A.2.1b / A.2.3b);
 Aggregate Woodfuel consumption for 1995 and 1996 in terms of m^3, tons and PJ (Table A.2.1c / A.2.3c);
 Per capita woodfuel consumption for 1995 and 1996 in terms of m^3 and tons (Table A.2.1);
 Primary conventional energy consumption in PJ (Table A.2.4);
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption in terms of m^3 (Table A.2.5). However this table is not really relevant since IEA did not distinguish between direct and indirect woodfuel;
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption in energy terms : PJ (Table A.2.6). However this table is not relevant for the same reason as above;
 Fuelwood sectorial consumption in m^3, tons and PJ (Table A.2.7a for 1995 and Table A.2.7b for 1996);
 Charcoal sectorial consumption in m^3, tons and PJ (Table A.2.7c for 1995 and Table A.2.7d for 1996);
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption by sector in energy terms : PJ (Table A.2.8).
2. In addition, another original table was also included in the datafile : LPG consumption in tons (Table A.2.12).

3.3.3. ESMAP statistics
The Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), jointly executed by the World Bank and UNDP, did not aggregate any of the energy data (especially for woodfuels) that were collected by the numerous projects initiated in various countries.
However, since almost all the published ESMAP documents for African countries were available in the FAO Library, they were consulted, compiled and assembled for the current study.
In the 1980s, ESMAP published two types of documents: energy policy issues, and final reports of specific ESMAP projects (particularly those expressly addressing household energy strategy).
The data collecting approach
For the first type of document, expert missions were undertaken in order to present the state of the art in the energy sector and to identify relevant areas of intervention. While no particular effort was made to consolidate woodfuel data, which were simply included in the energy balances (with no specifications on data origin and quality), these missions made a substantial effort to compile the best national data.
As regards project reports, many ESMAP projects addressed household energy issues, and substantial information was generated from field surveys; scope varied according to the specific issues identified in each of the concerned countries (e.g. urban areas, specific cities, etc.).
In both cases, and particularly for projects, ESMAP documents presented the best estimates available at that time. Therefore, the data could be used as a good basis for filling in gaps and reconstituting the time series.
ESMAP documents for 47 countries were consulted for this current study. The woodfuel data compiled and assessed are presented in Appendix 3.3.
Structure of ESMAP statistics
In general, ESMAP documents reported woodfuel data as a part of the energy balances in terms of ton of oil equivalent (TOE). However data were also sometimes available in terms of tons or cubic meters.
On the other hand, the data were presented for different periods, depending on data availability at national levels or on the year of the survey undertaken by ESMAP projects. In general, time series were not available except when the ESMAP teams were able to undertake simulation activity. However such derived figures cannot considered as concrete data for the purpose of this study.
Approach for using the data in the context of the study
Generally the ESMAP studies employed the existing definition of woodfuel uses, which is the same as the FAO definition. However, ESMAP generally applied specific conversion factors for fuelwood and charcoal, some of which differed from one country to another.
Where possible, data collected from ESMAP documents were included in the same eight tables used for the other data sources. However the data were only included when the conversion factors of woodfuels to original units (e.g. metric tons or m^3) were clearly defined.
Finally, the following tables were built up :
1. Figures of aggregate woodfuel consumption (from 1970 to 1990, where data were available):
 In terms of volume (Table A.3.1 : woodfuel consumption 1000 m^3, and Table A.3.1 Per capita woodfuel consumption in terms of m^3/year);
 In energy terms (Table A.3.3 : Petajoules);
2. Figures presenting :
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption (Table A.3.5a and Table A.3.5b) in terms of m^3;
 Direct and indirect woodfuel consumption (Table A.3.6) in energy terms (PJ).
3. Figures of sectorial woodfuel consumption (where data were available) :
 In terms of original units (Table A.3.7a : Fuelwood consumption 1000 tons, Table A.3.7b : Charcoal consumption 1000 tons, Table A.3.7c : Aggregated woodfuel consumption 1000 tons);
 In primary energy terms (Table A.3.8 : Petajoules);
4. In addition, original tables were also presented using a similar format but in the original units :
 Aggregate final woodfuel consumption in energy terms : PJ (Table A.3.14)
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption in terms of tons (Table A.3.17)
3.3.4. The ENDA statistics
The data collecting approach
Jointly with the Institut de l'Economie et Politique de l'Energie (IEPE, Grenoble, France), ENDA (Senegal) issued a synoptic study on the energy situation in Francophone African countries in 1995. This study aimed at compiling existing data on different energy commodities including biofuels. Except for Senegal, where some annual data on woodfuels (fuelwood and charcoal) were presented, the document does not present either data series or detailed figures on sectorial woodfuel consumption.
However, the data were collected at national level and thus could be consistently used in defining reference data for some countries where information was uncertain or unavailable from other sources.
Structure of the ENDA statistics
In general, the ENDA/IEPE document reports woodfuel in a simple format, providing figures on total fuelwood and charcoal consumption for each country studied in terms of metric tons. No details are provided on sectorial share, area shares (urban versus rural), and no comments are offered on data sources (surveys, studies, official documents, international data, etc.), data quality (primary, derived or estimated data), and the conversion factors to be applied.
Approach for using the data in the context of the study
The tables for fuelwood and charcoal consumption are presented using original units (1000 tons). Aggregate figures (fuelwood + charcoal) are presented using a similar energy conversion factor as FAO^(12). However, in order to present comparable figures, these data were converted into 1000 m^3 and PJ according to the same format as the other statistics.
Finally the following uniform tables were presented:
3. Figures of global woodfuel consumption (from 1985 to 1994, where data were available) :
 In terms of volume (Table A.4.1 : woodfuel consumption 1000 m^3, and Table A.4.2 Per capita woodfuel consumption : m^3/year)
 In energy terms (Table A.4.3 : Petajoules).
4. In addition, original tables were also presented using a similar format but with the original units :
 Fuelwood consumption in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.4.9)
 Charcoal consumption in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.4.10)
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.4.11)
 LPG consumption in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.4.12)
 Final conventional energy consumption in terms of 1000 TOE (Table A.4.13)
 Final woodfuel consumption of (Table A.4.14PJ)
 Final consumption of woodfuels as a function of the final energy consumption in terms of percentage (Table A.4.14 (%))
3.3.5. Other national woodfuel statistics
More than 120 different national, regional and international documents and studies addressing energy issues, particularly woodfuels, in African countries were consulted and compiled for this study. These data are presented in Appendix 3.5 for different time periods, and elements for cross-checking all data are provided.
The data collecting approach
Unlike the other formal databases or documents, there was no specific approach for addressing woodfuel data. The limited scope and duration of the study have provided only a few possibilities to collect data from different sources, including :
 various documents from the FAO Library;
 various documents from the IEA Library;
 various documents from the consultant's library;
 various documents from web sites (only Senegal has a relevant web site).
However, although no national institutions were contacted during the current study, the study undertook an unprecedented collecting and compiling effort, and almost all available documents in the specified libraries were consulted and adapted for inclusion in the different tables of Appendix 3.5, even those which were not systematically consistent. While certain relevant national documents may have been missed, it is unlikely that the analysis presented would have been modified significantly, at least at continental and sub-regional levels.
The ongoing regional workshops to be organized by FAO in 1999 in Africa certainly represent a unique opportunity to confirm this assumption, to consolidate the state-of-art of available data definitively, particularly at national levels, and to update knowledge on woodfuel topics in Africa.
Structure of the other national woodfuel statistics
In general, the collected woodfuel data were originally presented in various ways (aggregate woodfuels, specific fuelwood and charcoal consumption); units (TOE, tons, m^3, etc.) and; level of details (aggregate consumption, sectorial demand, consumption by area, etc.).
Except in a few cases, the data sources did not document the data origin (primary data from surveys, derived or estimated data, etc.), and did not address data quality issues. In addition, data sources tended to focus on woodfuel demand and only a few sources addressed woodfuel supply.
Approach for using the data in the context of the study
Data extracted from the various documents consulted were originally presented in different formats, units, time horizons and scope. Although sometimes inconsistent, all data are included in Annex 3.5, allowing the reader to check and be aware of the wide range of estimates available.
The most frequent formats examined presented national consumption in terms of tons, m^3 or other energy specific unit (TOE, PJ, etc.). Less frequently, certain documents presented sectorial woodfuel consumption, and in certain cases distinguished between fuelwood, charcoal and other woody biomass. The main difficulty was to interpret the figures collected consistently. However, this was not always easy; in many cases, it was not clear whether the reported figures covered all types of woodfuels, all consuming sectors, all areas (rural and urban), etc. Moreover, relevant details such as conversion factors, specific carbonization efficiencies, etc., were not systematically reported, and almost none of the documents indicated whether data were primary (field surveys) or secondary (available national estimates, estimates made by the authors, simulations based on models, etc.).
However, in order to conserve the significance of the original data, only the data that could be presented suitably using the defined unified format were reported. Therefore, many approximate data were excluded from the analysis, such as figures for woodfuel consumption derived from per capita woodfuel consumption without any detailed explanation (e.g. sectors included, woodfuels included, areas included, corresponding year of the data, etc.).
While considerable effort was made to present the original data faithfully, certain initiatives were taken to fill in the gaps. The general approach was to adopt the FAO definitions when some parameters were missing. For example, different assumed FAO parameters (e.g. calorific values of different woodfuels, moisture contents, etc.) were used unless specific and in
Ultimately, data were presented in the unified format used for the other data sources (FAO, IEA, etc.). The original data were included in the following two files:
1. Figures of sectorial fuelwood consumption (from 1973 to 1997, where data were available) in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.5.7a : Fuelwood consumption);
2. Figures of sectorial charcoal consumption (from 1973 to 1997, where data were available) in terms of 1000 tons (Table A.5.7b : Fuelwood consumption);
All other tables that were directly derived from the two tables include:
 Sectorial woodfuel consumption (from 1973 to 1997) in terms of 1000 m^3 (Table A.5.7c : Woodfuel consumption);
 Total woodfuel consumption in terms of 1000 m^3 (Table A.5.1);
 Per capita woodfuel consumption in terms of m^3/year (Table A.5.1 PerCapita);
 Total national woodfuel consumption in energy terms : Petajoules (Table A.5.3);
 National woodfuel consumption dividing direct and indirect woodfuel use in terms of 1000 m^3 (Table A.5.4). It should be recalled that Cote d'Ivoire was the only country where indirect woodfuel consumption was reported in national literature. This obviously does not mean that it is the only country that uses indirect woodfuel sources.
 National woodfuel consumption dividing direct and indirect woodfuel use in energy terms : Petajoules (Table A.5.6);
 Sectorial woodfuel consumption in energy terms : Petajoules (Table A.5.8);
 Aggregate woodfuel final consumption in energy terms : Petajoules (Table A.5.14PJ);
 Aggregate woodfuel consumption in terms of 1000 Tons (Table A.5.17).
3.3.6. Other international woodfuel statistics
African Development Bank statistics
In 1994, the African Development Bank (ADB) launched an African Energy Program, which carried out different expert missions in many African countries. The ADB programme addressed woodfuel issues and presented available data. These data were derived from the FAO database with no particular effort made to assess them or to compile any other data. Therefore no specific analysis or presentation of ADB data are made in the current report.
United Nations statistics
The annual United Nations publication "Energy Statistics Yearbook" presents statistical time series on the production, trade and consumption of energy, including biofuels. However, woodfuel data are completely derived from FAO statistics, the only difference being in the use of different conversion factors. Therefore the UN data were not analysed or presented in great detail in this report.
The World Resources Institute (WRI) statistics
The annual publication of the World Resources Institute "World Resources" presents statistical time series on energy production and consumption, including biofuels. However, again the data on woodfuels are also completely derived from FAO statistics. Therefore, no specific analysis or presentation of the WRI data are made.
3.4.Comparison of the aggregated results of the different databases and statistics
3.4.1. Different possibilities for comparison
It is not easy to compare data derived from a variety of sources. In fact, only a few comparable elements can be reported consistently. Difficulties arise for the following reasons:
 The FAO database is the only data source that provides almost comprehensive figures (all countries are included except 6 non woodfuel-determining countries : Cape Verde, Djibouti, Sao Tome and Principe, Saint Helena, Comoros, and Seychelles). In addition the time series are continuous for the whole scope of the study: 1980-1996. However, the FAO database only presents figures estimated by using assumed per capita consumption rather than actual figures. Furthermore FAO statistics provide no sectorial consumption figures.
 The IEA database presents individual data for only 23 countries. In order to complete the figures, 31 countries are grouped under "Other Africa" and their corresponding data are estimated approximately, while data on Saint Helena are not considered. In addition, sectorial woodfuel consumption is only available for 1995 and 1996, and data for the remaining years are only considered globally (data are estimated in terms of TOE of Primary Supply of Combustible Renewable and Waste, making it difficult to retrieve the corresponding figures for woodfuels considered under this item for each country).
 The ESMAP documents considered data for 39 countries out of 55. In fact, no data were reported for Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Guinea, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Botswana, Saint Helena, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Reunion, Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and South Africa. In addition, the ESMAP documents presented data of inconsistent quality and reported data for more than one reference year in only ten countries.
 The ENDA/IEPE documents reported data for only 28 countries, only 3 of which are not Francophone countries. In addition, except for Senegal, data were presented for only one year and no detailed sectorial consumption data were provided.
 Other national data collected were included in the tables as found. Therefore, it was not possible to aggregate the figures at sub-regional or African level, or to build up time series before undertaking an in-depth review of the data. This review was included within the major component of this study, which was to finalize the best estimates. In addition, data were missing for 15 countries : Djibouti, Eritrea, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo Democratic Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Saint Helena, Comoros, Madagascar, Reunion, and Libya.
Nevertheless, it might be interesting to show the gaps and the quality levels of the available data. This could help in identifying areas for data improvement and ways to achieve this.
3.4.2. Aggregate woodfuel consumption
Comparative analysis of aggregate woodfuel consumption figures from different sources was not relevant, particularly since these sources did not cover the same number of countries and provided incomplete time series. Therefore, the data presented in the following tables should only be viewed as illustrating the gaps characterizing woodfuel data in Africa.

3.4.3. The sectorial share of woodfuel consumption
Again it is not really relevant to compare data derived from different sources. However, by way of illustration, it might be interesting to underline the important share of households in the woodfuel balance for those sources where sectorial figures were provided: IEA, ESMAP and Others :

3.4.4. Per capita woodfuel consumption
Comparison of per capita consumption among the different data sources might prove more consistent despite the gaps. In fact, the aggregate sub-regional averages are much less affected by these gaps given the general similarities of global woodfuel behaviour within a limited geographical area.
The numerous gaps, particularly in IEA, ESMAP and ENDA data, prevented consistent sub-regional comparisons. However, these gaps may not have systematically affected comparability of the aggregate African average from these sources. In fact, the following table shows relatively comparable aggregated figures, particularly between FAO and ENDA sources in one side, and between IEA, ESMAP and other national sources, on the other.

4: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS OF WOODFUEL DATABASES
4.1. Rationale for launching a data collection process for woodfuels in Africa
Past trends of LPG use in Africa show that it is unlikely to play a significant medium-term role in meeting energy demand. Moreover, even for those 6 countries (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia) where LPG is used considerably, particularly in urban areas, woodfuels still play a significant role in meeting the demand for cooking, water heating and space heating.
In the future, these trends are likely to be confirmed; in fact woodfuel use is even growing owing to the following three parameters:
 Population growth, which is higher than the substitution process to LPG.
 The urbanization process, which generally implies a shift to charcoal in most African countries. Low carbonization efficiencies will mean greater wood demand (13).
 The concentration of consumption in urban areas leads to greater pressure on nearby forest resources. In addition, carbonization practices will mean systematic clearing operations for production purposes whereas fuelwood use was mainly a by-product of forest clearing activities arising from shifting cultivation practices.
These facts will lead to greater pressure on forest ecosystems and to woodfuel being considered among the most crucial environment issues to be addressed in the future.
4.2. Current status of the national or international data collection process for woodfuels
Despite several past attempts at improving biofuel information systems in Africa, woodfuel information is still very scarce or poor quality, which prevents countries from undertaking detailed diagnosis and relevant planning activities.
In fact, woodfuel data collecting and recording was never considered a crucial issue and field surveys were never undertaken on a regular basis. (Only a few African countries have actually undertaken more than one national woodfuel demand survey during the last thirty years.) Moreover, the surveys generally used to cover a limited aspect of woodfuel demand (e.g., households only, urban only, fuelwood only, etc).
In many cases, estimates are global and uncertain and are sometimes the result of inconsistent extrapolation (e.g., woodfuel patterns for a village extrapolated to national rural level, etc.), while data quality and uncertainty were never documented.
Information on supply is often lacking or highly uncertain. Furthermore it is difficult to determine the share of woodfuels according to type (direct, indirect, recovered), origin (natural forests, fruit trees, etc.), or to extraction practice (specific forest clearing for energy purposes, collection after forest clearing undertaken for agricultural purposes, etc.).
At international level, FAO is the only organization which stores and records historical data using a specific annual questionnaire sent out to countries. However, the surveying approach has proved to be inefficient:
 The questionnaire is transmitted through official channels (generally to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs), making it difficult to target the most relevant department or the most suitable person. Most of the time, answers are received very late or not at all, particularly for woodfuel data.
 Despite their importance in wood removals, woodfuels are modestly addressed and the requested information is put forward in such a way that countries would rather address the commercial side of woodfuel use or even totally neglect woodfuels. Moreover, the questionnaire does not cover the supply side of the woodfuel issue.
As a result, FAO would make annual extrapolations for almost all African countries in order to fill in the gaps, adopting a simple approach based on fixed per capita consumption. While this proved to be highly inconsistent at African aggregated level, the uncertainties are rather systematic at country level. Therefore, the approach needs to be modified in the particular case of woodfuels.
More recently, IEA launched a new process of reconstituting time series after a relevant data collection effort; however, this process has already reached its final phase and is unlikely to become an ongoing activity.
4.3. Recommendations for the future development of woodfuel data in Africa
Thus, given the social, economic and ecological importance of woodfuels and their contribution to development, a data collection process needs to be developed at national and international levels. This process should be established in three different steps:
 short term: establishing a more efficient data collection process;
 medium term: launching a pilot project aimed at improving data in major woodfuel consuming countries;
 longer term: establishing an adequate data collecting and updating framework at national and international levels, including field surveys and specific updating approaches (limited annual surveys, simulation, models, etc.).
4.3.1. Data collection procedure in the short term
In the short term, FAO should set up a more efficient data collection process. While it is useful to send out annual surveys to countries, this is only relevant for those countries that have undertaken recent surveys; otherwise only a few replies are received.
In order to overcome this problem, it is recommended that the data collection approach be modified in the following ways:
a) Identifying the relevant institutions and experts in each country in Africa, and launching a new collaborative process. This task is to be initiated immediately as programmed by FAO, and should cover the following activities:
 identifying the most relevant specialists in each African country during the regional workshops;
 involving the FAO Program Officers in the countries concerned;
 consolidating the best estimates and identifying the gaps;
 collecting the recommendations from country experts on improving data collecting procedures in Africa.
b) Modifying the data query procedure: the questionnaire should henceforward be transmitted to the most relevant person in each country. During regional workshops, countries should decide to nominate an official person to act as a counterpart to the FAO Program Officer for data compilation and collection.
c) Defining a new questionnaire to address suitable issues related to woodfuel use. This questionnaire should comply completely with FAO definitions and unified terminology (a detailed presentation of the sheets is available in Appendix 8). However, in addition to woodfuel data, this questionnaire should cover the following questions:
 countries' circumstances linked to woodfuel use;
 uncertainty assessment of the data;
 specifications of data origin (estimates, field surveys, etc.).
 Subsequently, it would also be interesting to develop a more refined questionnaire that covers other modules such as:
 information on woodfuel economics;
 information on the social aspects of woodfuel (distance, time spent collecting woodfuels, time for production, responsibility of woodfuel gathering, etc.).
d) Including a definitions/conventions module in the questionnaire in order to adapt better to specific country conditions. FAO can then calculate the corresponding average parameters for Africa rather than making assumptions that are a long way from representing real conditions in African Countries. As a minimum, the module should cover the following parameters:
 Woodfuels conversion factors to energy: instead of developing a compulsory unified conversion factor for the whole of Africa, it would be more appropriate to suggest default factors, since what is required is an evaluation of the actual energy content of woodfuels. Priority should be given to encouraging the gathering of country specific data since these conversion factors are a function of the conditions under which woodfuels are used.
 Carbonization efficiency: this is critical information, particularly in countries where charcoal plays a major role. Again, it is only necessary to put forward default efficiency factors that are estimated realistically according to the African context. For example, the present study showed that the carbonization ratio varies from 6 to 10 tons of wood for a ton of charcoal according to country. Priority should also be given to encouraging the gathering of country specific data.
 Combustion efficiency for the different cooking equipment: this information is necessary to determine the basic energy needs of local people and to undertake relevant projection exercises for planning and comparison purposes. This will also help in assessing savings potential that could be achieved through the use of improved combustion technologies.
 The moisture content of fuelwood: this is essential for assessing fuel energy content as well as carbonization and combustion efficiencies. This information is also important for consistent analysis of demand-supply balances. Here again, it would be necessary to gather country specific data although data availability on moisture content would represent a limiting factor.
 Specific density factors of the wood to be considered in each country: this factor is subject to large variations according to the wood species and specific country estimates. While it could be used to produce aggregate figures, a unified African factor would not be relevant at national levels. Therefore, countries should adopt their own initiatives for calculating density factors.
e) Enabling country experts to use simplified models for simulating the required data and preparing a unified framework for this task in order to facilitate data aggregation at African level. African countries are unable to carry out large annual surveys to monitor woodfuel demand and supply. Panel surveys or frequent surveys (e.g. large national surveys every 3-5 years) are not even possible. However countries should have the possibility to simulate annual demand and supply using simplified models in order to complete the time series. These models might differ according to specific country conditions; however, a unified modeling approach could be developed in order to produce consistent projections for aggregation.
4.3.2. Data collection procedures in the medium term
In addition to short-term initiatives, the quality of woodfuel data in Africa could be improved considerably by launching a pilot programme targeting the 10 major African consuming countries (around 66% of African woodfuel consumption) or the countries where data quality was particularly poor or where data were unavailable. This programme could be launched within the next two years for a two-year period; it would be based primarily on field surveys. An adequate methodology and surveying approach should be developed in order to minimize costs^(14) and maximize the quality of outputs. This programme should include the following characteristics :
 a quick national survey (no more than 6-9 months of field survey);
 data gathering on woodfuel demand by sector and by area;
 data gathering on woodfuel demand by woodfuel type;
 information gathering on woodfuel patterns and behaviors : past trends and outcomes;
 supply side information (origin of woodfuels, collecting practices, etc.).
4.3.3. Data collection procedure in the longer term
Eventually a data collection and updating framework should be developed in each African country as well as a systematic transmission process to FAO, which would act as an observatory compiling the data at aggregated levels.
This new process requires accurate definition in order to facilitate the aggregation process. Several components might be suggested:
 launching an ongoing observation process for woodfuel data (demand, supply, demand-supply balance) in each country, through regular field surveys, remote sensing and cartography programmes;
 defining a framework for collaboration between African countries and FAO in the woodfuel domain in order to monitor the process properly;
 defining a regional framework for collaboration and exchanges of experience among African countries.
APPENDICES
13 Twice as much wood would be needed in terms of charcoal to meet the same useful energy need as fuelwood (considering 18% combustion efficiency for charcoal and 13% for fuelwood).
14 The approximate cost of the field surveys would range from US$ 100.000 to US$ 150.000 depending on the size of the country.

Appendix 1
Definitions, Conventions and
Conversion Factors Applied
DEFINITIONS, CONVENTIONS AND CONVERSION FACTORS
Fuelwood : Primary wood combusted as it is for satisfying energy needs (final sectorial use or even for electricity generation where relevant). This definition corresponds to the one adopted by UWET where all wood sources, that have not undergone any energy conversion process, are considered. Woodfuels could be used under different forms:
 Direct : Fuelwood that is collected/removed directly from the fields for the specific energy purposes;
 Indirect : Fuelwood that does not come directly from the fields, i.e. the wood was removed for other purposes (e.g. Industrial, conditioning, traditional industries, etc.) and the Fuelwood is rather a by-product (e.g. Fuelwood that comes from the different kinds of wood residues produced by the wood industry units);
 Recovered (or recycled) : Fuelwood that is recovered from furniture, and different wood items after their normal utilization life.
Charcoal : Energy item that is derived from Fuelwood and used to satisfying final sectorial energy demand or even for electricity generation where relevant.
Carbonization Ratio (Tons Wood/1 Ton Charcoal) : 1 Ton of charcoal is derived from 6 CUM of Fuelwood according to FAO assumptions (which means 4.35 tons of wood for 1 ton of charcoal). However, this estimate is not likely to be generalized for the case of Africa where the carbonization efficiency is substantially lower. In fact, the Carbonization Ratio is rather ranging from 5 to 12.6 tons of wood for 1 ton of charcoal, according to different statistical sources consulted.
For sources other than FAO the general Carbonization Ratio assumed = 6. However, when mentioned, the specific ratio of each data source was applied. The list of the specific ratios are included in the introductory section of each of the data source related appendix.
Black Liquor : a specific wood-derived fuel (indirect woodfuel) that is recovered and used as fuel from the manufacture of paper. The derived energy comes from the lignin removed from the wood pulp.
Woodfuels : include all categories of primary or converted wood used for energy : Fuelwood, Charcoal and Black liquor.
Final Energy (or woodfuel) : Energy that is quantified at the final user level (consumer). The calorific values and conversion factors used are those assumed by the FAO, i.e. :
 1 kg of Fuelwood = 13.8 Mj
 1 kg of Charcoal = 30.8 Mj
 Wood Density : 1 CUM of Wood = 0.725 tons
 Black Liquor : 1 Ton chemical Pulp produced Equivalent to 2.27 CUM Wood
 1 CUM of Wood = 10 000 GJ
 TOE (Ton of Oil Equivalent) = 41.868 x 10^-3 TJ
 MJ : Mega Joule = 10^6 Joules
 GJ : Giga Joule = 10^9 Joules
 TJ : Tera Joule = 10^12 Joules
 PJ : Peta Joule : = 10^15 Joules
Primary Energy : Energy that is quantified at the primary user level before any transformation process. For example, the primary Woodfuel consumption is quantified in energy terms by adding the following items : Fuelwood + Charcoal (in terms of Fuelwood equivalent using the carbonization ratio) + Black Liquor (in terms of Woodfuel equivalent using the conversion ratio mentioned above)

P.S : Many other ESMAP documents addressed Woodfuel use in a number of African countries, especially those related to Specific Projects on woodfuels undertaken in theses countries. However they were not relevant for the current study since they addressed only a specific question, e.g. Woodfuel use in the main urban areas, or woodfuel in some traditional sectors, etc., and there was no possibility to extrapolate these specific data for the purposes of the current study.

<title>Compendium of Food Additive Specifications. Addendum 5. (FAO Food and Nutrition Paper - 52 Add. 5)</title>
<section>1</section>
INTRODUCTION
This volume contains specifications of identity and purity prepared at the forty-ninth meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Rome, 17-26 June 1997. These specifications should be considered only in conjunction with the Report of the above meeting which will be printed in the WHO Technical Report Series. Toxicological monographs of the substances considered at the 49th meeting of JECFA will be published in the WHO Food Additives Series as No. 40.
The general principles applied in the elaboration of specifications established at the earlier JECFA sessions have been published in the Principles for the Safety Assessment of Food Additives and Contaminants in Food, WHO Environmental Health Criteria, No. 70, 1987. The specifications of identity and purity of food additives established by JECFA are meant to identify the substance that has been subject to biological testing, to ensure that the substance is of adequate degree of purity for safe use in food, and to reflect and encourage good manufacturing practices. These principles were last reaffirmed by the 39th session of JECFA in 1992.
The specifications are mainly established for the use of toxicologists and others concerned with the identity and purity of the substance. As agreed by JECFA at its twenty-sixth meeting, specifications may also be established prior to the eventual completion of toxicological evaluation, in certain cases, when the available toxicological data are inadequate or incomplete, and do not permit the establishment of full or temporary acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). References are made in individual specifications to some of the criteria that may be of interest in commerce, but they do not necessarily include all the requirements of interest to the commercial user. These specifications are not more stringent than is necessary to accomplish their purpose and should easily be attainable by the producing industries. The report of the twenty-third session gives the reasons why certain specifications are designated as "tentative".
There were a total of 204 specifications prepared at the 49th session of which 158 were new. Thirty-four specifications were designated as tentative. Specifications for anoxomer were withdrawn because the substance is no longer a product of commerce. Specifications for turmeric were withdrawn, because the Committee considered the substance as food. Specifications for enzyme-treated starches were included in the revised specifications for modified starches.
Comments and suggestions regarding this Volume are encouraged. Please send to Chief, Food Quality and Standards Service, Food and Nutrition Division, FAO, Via delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.
NOTE: Use of italics in specifications refers to General Methods (Guide to JECFA Specifications), FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 5/Rev. 2 (1991), unless otherwise indicated or evident.

TESTS
a -Acetolactate decarboxylase activity
PRINCIPLE
The enzyme a -acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) decarboxylates a -acetolactate to produce acetoin. The resultant acetoin can be reacted with a mixture of naphthol and creatine, resulting in quantitative formation of a characteristic red colour.
APPARATUS
1. Spectrophotometer or equivalent capable of measuring optical density (absorbance) at 522 nm
2. Water bath, held at 30±1 °, containing test tube rack
3. Volumetric glassware
REAGENTS
1. MES buffer, 0.05M (pH = 6.0).
Dissolve 9.76 g of MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid) in approximately 900 ml of deionised water. Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 1-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
2. Brij 35 solution, 15% w/v.
Dissolve 15.0 g of Brij 35 (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, Atlas Chemie, BDH, or equivalent) in approximately 70 ml of deionised water, heating to 60° to aid dissolution. After cooling, transfer to a 100-ml volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution should be stored in a refrigerator, and can be kept for up to two months.
3. MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution.
Dissolve 48.8 g of MES and 175.32 g of NaCl (AR grade) in approximately 4.5 litres of deionised water. Add 17 ml of 15% Brij 35 solution (see 2. above). Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 1 N NaOH. Transfer to a 5-litre volumetric flask and make to volume with deionised water. This solution may be kept for two weeks at room temperature.
4. a -Acetolactate substrate, 0.2% v/v.
Pipette 100 m l of ethyl-2-acetoxy-2-methylacetolactate into a 50 ml volumetric flask. Add 6.0 ml of 0.5 N NaOH to the flask and stir for 20 minutes. Add MES buffer (see 1. above) to bring the volume to approximately 40 ml. Adjust pH to 6.0 ± 0.5 with 0.5 N HCl. Make to volume with MES buffer (see 1. above). This substrate should be made just before use.
5. Naphthol/Creatine colour reagent.
Dissolve 5.00 g of 1-naphthol and 0.50 g of creatine in 1 N NaOH, make to volume with 1 N NaOH in a 500-ml volumetric flask. This colour reagent should be made fresh just before use and shielded from light as much as possible.
6. Acetoin stock solution, 1000 mg/l.
Dissolve 0.100 g of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in deionised water in a 100-ml volumetric flask. Make to volume with deionised water.
7. Acetoin standards.
Dilute 0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 ml of stock acetoin solution (see 6. above) to volume with deionised water in 100-ml volumetric flasks to give standard solutions of 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/l of acetoin. These solution may be kept for two weeks stored in a refrigerator.
8. Enzyme solutions.
Test samples of the enzyme a -acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) are diluted with MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (see 3. above). The exact dilution will need to be determined by experience and experimentation to give an enzyme concentration which produces a result within the range of the acetoin standards (see 7. above) under the conditions of the test.
PROCEDURE
Preparation of standard curve
Prepare a standard curve by treating the acetoin standards (7.) in the following manner:
Pipette 400 m l of the acetoin standard solutions into 10-ml plastic test tubes. Add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.) to each test tube, mix, and let the test tube stand at room temperature for exactly 40 minutes. At the end of this 40 minute period, place 0 mg/l acetoin standard in the spectrophotometer set to read absorbance at 522 nm and adjust absorbance reading to zero. Measure the absorbance of the remaining acetoin standards at 522 nm.
Determination of enzyme activity
Preheat enzyme solutions (see 8. above), MES buffer (see 1. above), and the substrate (see 4. above) in a water bath at 30± 1°C for approximately 10 minutes.
Four solutions must be prepared for each analysis:
1. Enzyme blank (B1). Pipette 200 m l of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 m l of MES buffer (1.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube back into the water bath.
2. Sample value (HI). Pipette 200 m l of enzyme solution (8.) and 200 m l of substrate (4.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
3. Buffer blank (B2). Pipette 200 m l of MES buffer (1.) and 200 m l of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
4. Buffer value (H2). Pipette 200 m l of MES/Brij 35/NaCl solution (3.) and 200 m l of substrate (4.) into a 10 ml plastic test tube. Mix, and immediately place the test tube into the water bath.
For each enzyme determination the test tubes, are prepared in the order: B1, H1, B2, H2.
Exactly 20 minutes after mixing of each of solutions B1, H1, B2, and H2, remove from water bath, add 4.6 ml of colour reagent (5.), mix and leave at room temperature for exactly 40 minutes. At the end of this 40 minute period measure the absorbance of the solutions at 522 nm on a spectrophotometer or equivalent previously adjusted so that the 0 mg/l acetoin standard gives an absorbance reading of zero.
CALCULATION
The activity of the ALDC enzyme is defined in terms of activity units where:
1 ADU (a -Acetolactate Decarboxylase Unit) = the amount of enzyme which, by decarboxylation of a -acetolactate produces 1 m mol of acetoin per minute under the test reaction conditions.
Plot optical density values at 522 nm for the acetoin standards against acetoin concentration (in mg acetoin/l) of the standard and generate a standard curve. Use the standard curve to convert the optical density measurements for solutions H1, B1, H2, and B2 to mg acetoin/l.
Where:
[H1], [B1], [H2], [B2] are the concentrations of acetoin in the respective solutions in mg/l
F is the final volume of enzyme solution, after dilutions, in millilitres
W is the weight of enzyme in volume F, in grams
The factor 0.0011351 contains:
· the conversion from mg acetoin/l to m mol acetoin/min
· the conversion for the actual volumes of substrate and enzyme solution used in the analysis.

TESTS
IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Gel formation with water
Prepare a 1.0% solution of the sample in boiling water in a flask and place the flask in water at 30° for 15 min. A firm, resistant gel is formed. Place the flask in water at 70° for 1 h, the gel is not molten. When heating the flask at higher temperature than 95°, gel is liquefied to form a clear solution.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulfate solution
A warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample gives a precipitate with half its volume of a warm (40°) 40% ammonium sulfate solution. This test distinguishes agar from alginates, gum arabic, gum ghatti, karaya gum, pectin and tragacanth.
Precipitate formation with lead acetate solution
A warm 0.5% solution of the sample gives a precipitate with one fifth its volume of basic lead acetate TS. This test distinguishes agar from methyl cellulose.
Microscopy
Place a few fragments of unground agar or some powder on a slide and add some drops of water or chloral hydrate TS. When examined under a microscope, agar in water appears granular and somewhat filamentous. In chloral hydrate TS, the powdered agar appears more transparent than in water.
PURITY TESTS
Water absorption
Place 5 g of the sample in a 100-ml graduated cylinder, fill to the mark with water, mix, and allow to stand at 25° for 24 h. Pour the contents of the cylinder through moistened glass wool, allowing the water to drain into a second 100-ml graduated cylinder. Not more than 75 ml of water should be obtained.
Foreign insoluble matter
Boil 5 g of the sample with 500 ml of water and 12 ml of sulfuric acid under a reflux condenser for 2 h. Allow to cool and filter through a tared, fine, sintered glass crucible. Wash flask and filter with 50 ml of water, dry at 105° to constant weight and weigh. Calculate as percentage.
Starch and dextrins
To a warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample, add 2 drops of iodine TS. Where the drops fall, a red-violet colour appears. After mixing, the solution should be golden brown and not blue or reddish.
Gelatin and other proteins
To a warm (40°) 0.5% solution of the sample add 1 volume of warm (40°) picric acid TS. No turbidity should appear within 10 min.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Threshold gel concentration: Prepare serial dilutions of the sample with known solids content (0.15%, 0.20%, 0.25%, etc.) and place in tubes, 150 mm long by 16 mm internal diameter, stoppered at both ends. Cool for 1 h at 20-25°. Allow cylinders of gel to slide from the tubes to a level surface. The lowest concentration of gel that resists gravity without rupture for 5-30 sec is the threshold concentration of the sample.

Filter while hot through a tared Gooch crucible provided with a glass fibre filter (2.4 cm, No. 934 AH, Reeve Angel & Co., Clifton, N.Y., or equivalent filter). If slow filtration is caused by high viscosity of the sample solution, boil until the viscosity is reduced enough to permit filtration. Wash the crucible thoroughly with hot water, dry the crucible and its contents at 105º for 1 h, cool and weigh. Calculate as percentage of the dry weight.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 27.12 mg of ammonium alginate (equivalent weight 217).

To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-fifth of its volume of a 2.5% solution of calcium chloride. A voluminous, gelatinous precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes calcium alginate from gum arabic, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, gelatin, gum ghatti, karaya gum, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and tragacanth gum.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulphate
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-half of its volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. No precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes calcium alginate from agar, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, de-esterified pectin, gelatin, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and starch.
Test for alginate
Dissolve as completely as possible 0.01 g of the sample by shaking with 0.15 ml of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and add 1 ml of acid ferric sulfate TS. Within 5 min, a cherry-red colour develops that finally becomes deep purple.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 27.38 mg of calcium alginate (equivalent weight 219).

IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Detector tube test
Pass 100±5 ml, released from the vapor phase of the contents of the container, through a carbon dioxide detector tube (see below) at the rate specified for the tube: The indicator change extends throughout the entire indicating range of the tube.
Detector tube is a fuse-sealed glass tube (Draeger or equivalent) that is designed to allow gas to be passed through it and that contains suitable adsorbing filters and support media for the indicators hydrazine and crystal violet. (The Draeger Reference Number is CH 30801, National Draeger Inc., P.O. Box 120, Pittsburgh, PA 15205-0120, USA; the measuring range is 0.01% to 0.30%).
PURITY TESTS
Acidity
Transfer 50 ml of water, previously boiled and cooled to room temperature, into a Nessler tube. Introduce 1,000 ml of the sample into the water through a tube (1 mm internal diameter) keeping the opening of the tube within 2 mm from the bottom of the vessel. Add 0.1 ml of methyl orange TS. The red colour produced is not darker than the colour of an identical control solution to which has been added 1.0 ml of 0.01 N hydrochloric acid instead of the carbon dioxide.
Phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and other organic reducing substances
Transfer 25 ml of silver ammonium nitrate TS and 3 ml of ammonia TS into a Nessler tube. In the absence of light, introduce 1,000 ml of the sample in the same manner as in the test of Acidity. No brown colour is produced.
Carbon monoxide
Principle:
Carry out the test on the first portion of gas issuing from the cylinder. Use 5.0 1 of the sample mixed with an equal volume of carbon monoxide-free nitrogen and 10 1 of carbon monoxide-free nitrogen as the control. The difference between the volumes of 0.002 N sodium thiosulfate used in the two titrations is not greater than 0.5 ml.
Apparatus:
The apparatus consists of the following parts connected in series:
- U-tube containing anhydrous silica gel impregnated with chromium trioxide.
- Scrubber bottle (dreschel type) containing 100 ml of a 40% w/v solution of potassium hydroxide.
- U-tube containing phosphorus pentoxide dispersed on previously granulated, fused pumice.
- Tube containing recrystallized iodic anhydride (I[2]O[5]) in granules, previously dried at 200° and kept at a temperature of 120°. The iodic anhydride is packed in the tube in 1-cm columns separated by 1-cm columns of glass wool to give an effective length of 5 cm.
- Flask containing 2.0 ml of potassium iodide TS and 3 drops of starch solution TS.
Procedure:
Flush the apparatus with 5.0 l of carbon dioxide-free air and, if necessary, discharge the blue colour in the iodide solution by adding the smallest necessary quantity of freshly prepared 0.002 N sodium thiosulfate. Continue flushing until not more than 0.045 ml of 0.002 N sodium thiosulfate is required after passing 5.0 1 of carbon dioxide-free air. Pass the gas from the cylinder through the apparatus.
Flush the last traces of liberated iodine into the reaction flask by passing through the apparatus 1.0 l of carbon monoxide-free air. Titrate the liberated iodine with 0.002 N sodium thiosulfate. Carry out a blank assay using 10 l of carbon monoxide-free nitrogen. The difference between the volumes of 0.002 N sodium thiosulfate solution used in the two titrations should not be more than 0.5 ml.
Non-volatile hydrocarbons
Pass a sample of liquid carbon dioxide from storage container or sample cylinder through a commercial carbon dioxide snow horn directly into an open, clean container. Weigh 500 g of this sample into a clean beaker. Allow the carbon dioxide solid to sublime completely, with a watch-glass placed over the beaker to prevent ambient contamination. Wash the beaker with a residue-free solvent, and transfer the solvent from the beaker to a clean, tared watch-glass or petri dish with two additional rinses of the beaker with the solvent. Allow the solvent to evaporate, using heating to 104° until the watch-glass or petri dish is at a constant weight. Determine the weight of the residue by difference. The weight of the residue does not exceed 5 mg.
Volatile hydrocarbons
Standard preparation: Flush a 500-ml glass, septum-equipped sampling bulb with helium, and inject into the bulb a 5.00-ml sample of methane. Allow the bulb to stand for 15 min to permit the gases to mix, and then inject 2.50 ml of the mixture into a second 500-ml sampling bulb, also flushed with helium, and allow this tube to stand for 15 min to permit the gases to mix. This mixture is a nominal 50 ppm v/v standard. Determine the exact concentration from the exact volumes of the the gas-sampling bulbs. To determine these volumes, weigh the empty tubes, fill them with water, and reweigh. From the weight of the water and its temperature, calculate the volumes of the tubes.
Chromatographic system: The gas chromatograph is equipped with the flame ionization detector and a 1.8-m x 3-mm od metal column packed with 80- to 100-mesh Hayesep Q (or equivalent). The carrier gas is helium at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The injector temperature and the detector temperatures both are maintained at 230°. The column temperature is programmed according to the following steps: It is held at 70° for 1 min, then increased to 200° at a rate 20°/min, and then held at 200° for 10 min. The parameters for the detector are sensitivity range: 10^-12 A/mV; attenuation: 32. The concentration of volatile hydrocarbons is reported in methane equivalents. The various gas chromatographic responses, excluding the carbon dioxide response, are summed to yield the total volatile hydrocarbon concentration. The composition of hydrocarbons present will vary from sample to sample. Typical retention times are methane: 0.4 min; carbon dioxide: 0.8 min; hexane: 14.4 min.
Procedure: Inject in triplicate 1.00 ml of the standard preparation into the gas chromatograph, and average the peak area responses. The relative standard deviation should not exceed 5.0%. Similarily, inject in triplicate 1.00 ml of sample, sum the average peak areas of the individual peaks, except for the carbon dioxide peaks, and calculate the concentration v/v in the sample by formula:
m l/L = S(A[U]/A[S]),
in which S is the calculated ppm of methane in the standard preparation (approximately 50 m l/l), A[U] is the sum of the averages of the individual peak area responses in the sample, and As is the average area of the standard preparation area responses.
Water
Water vapor detector tube. A fuse-sealed glass tube (Draeger or equivalent) that is designed to allow gas to be passed through it and that contains suitable absorbing filters and support media for the indicator, which consists of a selenium sol in suspension of sulphuric acid. (The Draeger Reference Number is CH 67 28531, National Draeger Inc., P.O. Box 120, Pittsburgh, PA 15205-0120, USA; the measuring range is 5 to 200 mg/m^3).
Pass 24,000 ml of the gas sample through a suitable water-absorption tube not less than 100 mm in length, which previously has been flushed with about 500 ml of the sample and weighed. Regulate the flow so that about 60 min will be required for passage of the gas. The gain in weight of the absorption tube does not exceed 1.0 mg.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Transfer a 1 in 3 potassium hydroxide solution into a gas pipette of adequate volume. Measure accurately about 1,000 ml of the sample into a gas burette containing a 1 in 10 sodium chloride solution. Transfer the sample into the gas pipette and shake well. When the volume of gas remaining unabsorbed is constant (V ml), the content of carbon dioxide is calculated by:

Chemical formula
SO[2]
Formula weight
Assay
Not less than 99% SO[2] by weight
DESCRIPTION
Colourless, non-flammable gas, with strong, pungent, suffocating odour. Its vapor density is 2.26 times that of air at atmospheric pressure and 0°. The specific gravity of the liquid is about 1.436 at 0°/4°. At 20° the solubility is about 10 g of SO[2] per 100 g of solution. It is normally supplied under pressure in containers in which it is present in both liquid and gaseous phases.
Caution: Sulfur dioxide gas is intensely irritating to the eyes, throat, and upper respiratory system. Liquid sulfur dioxide may cause skin bums, which result from the freezing effect of the liquid on tissue. Safety precautions to be observed in handling of the material are specified in technical brochures from liquid sulfur dioxide manufacturers, suppliers or organizations of gas manufacturers or suppliers (For example, "Pamphlet G-3" published by the Compressed Gas Association, Suite 1004, 1725 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, USA).

TESTS
Sampling:
Samples of sulfur dioxide may be safely withdrawn from a tank or transfer lines, either of which should be equipped with a 1-cm nozzle and valve. Samples should be taken in bombs constructed of 316 stainless steel, designed to withstand 7 MPa (1000 psig) and equipped with 316 stainless steel needle valves on both ends. To draw a sample, the bomb is first flushed with dry air to remove any sulfur dioxide, remaining from previous sample drawings, and then attached to the tank or transfer lines with a solid pipe connection. A hose is connected to the other end of the bomb and submerged in either a weak caustic solution or water. Any gas in the bomb is discharged into the caustic or water by first opening the valve at the pipe end, followed by slowly opening at the valve at the hose end. When all of the gas is dispelled and liquid sulfur dioxide begins to emerge into the solution, the valve at the hose end is blocked off. The other valves are then tightly closed, and the bomb is
detached from the pipe connecting it to the tank or transfer line. Approximately 15% of the liquid sulfur dioxide in the bomb is then discharged into the water or caustic solution. The bomb is then capped at its end and transferred to the laboratory for analysis.
Caution: The bomb should never be stored with more than 85% of the total water capacity of the bomb.
Sample Solution for the Determination of Lead, and Selenium: Measure out 100 ml of sulfur dioxide (144g) into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and determine the weight of sample taken by the loss in weight of the sample bomb. Evaporate to dryness on a steam bath, add 3 ml of nitric acid and 10 ml of water to the dry flask, and warm gently on a hot plate for 15 min. Transfer the contents of the flask to a 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix. Transfer a 10.0-ml aliquot into a second 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Note: The tests in which this solution is to be used will be accurate assuming a 144 g sample has been taken; if not, the weight of sample actually taken must be considered in the calculations.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Subtract from 100 the percentages of non-volatile residue and of water, as determined herein, to obtain the percentage of SO[2].

PURITY TESTS
Total acetic acid
Apparatus:
Assemble a modified Hortvet-Sellier distillation apparatus as shown in the figure, using a sufficiently large (approximately 38- x 203-mm) inner Sellier tube and large distillation trap.
Procedure:
Transfer 4 g of sample, accurately weighed into the inner tube of the assembly, and insert the tube in the outer flask containing about 300 ml of recently boiled hot water. To the sample add 10 ml of approximately 4N perchloric acid [35 ml (60g) of 70% perchloric acid in 100 ml of water], and connect the inner tube to a water-cooled condenser through the distillation trap. Distil by heating the outer flask so that 100 ml of distillate is collected within 20 to 25 min. Collect the distillate in 100-ml portions, add phenolphthalein TS to each portion, and titrate with 0.5N sodium hydroxide. Continue the distillation until a 100-ml portion of the distillate requires no more than 0.5 ml of 0.5N sodium hydroxide for neutralization. (Caution: Do not distil to dryness.) Calculate the weight, in mg, of volatile acids in the sample taken by the formula V x e, in which V is the total volume, in ml, of 0.5N sodium hydroxide consumed in the series of titrations and e is the equivalence
factor 30.03.
Total tartaric acid
Standard curve:
Transfer 100 mg of reagent-grade tartaric acid, accurately weighed, into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dissolve it in about 90 ml of water, add water to volume, and mix well. Transfer 3.0-. 4.0-, 5.0-, and 6.0-ml portions into separate 19- x 150-mm matched cuvettes, and add sufficient water to make 10.0 ml. To each cuvette add 4.0 ml of a freshly prepared 1 in 20 solution of sodium metavanadate and 1.0 ml of acetic acid. (Note: Use these solutions within 10 min after colour development.) Prepare a blank in the same manner, using 10 ml of water in place of the tartaric acid solutions. Set the instrument at zero with the blank, and then determine the absorbance of the four solutions of tartaric acid at 520 nm with a suitable spectrophotometer or a photoelectric colorimeter equipped with a 520-nm filter. From the data thus obtained, prepare a standard curve by plotting the absorbances on the ordinate against the corresponding quantities, in mg, of the tartaric acid on the
abscissa.
Test Preparation:
Transfer about 4 g of the sample, accurately weighed, into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and add 80 ml of approximately 0.5N potassium hydroxide and 0.5 ml of phenolphthalein TS. Connect an air condenser of at least 65 cm in length to the flask, and heat the mixture on a hot plate for about 2.5h. Add to the hot mixture approximately 10% phosphoric acid until it is definitely acid to congo red test paper. Reconnect the air condenser, and heat until the fatty acids are liquified and clear. Cool and then transfer the mixture into a 250-ml separator with the aid of small portions of water and chloroform. Extract the liberated fatty acids with three successive 25-ml portions of water, and add the washings to the separator containing the water layer. Transfer the contents of the first separator to a 250-ml beaker, heat on a steam bath to remove traces of chloroform under hood, filter through acid-washed, fine-texture filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume
with water (Solution I). Pipet 25.0 ml of this solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water (Solution II). Retain the rest of Solution I for the determination of total glycerol.
Procedure:
Transfer 10.0 ml of Solution II prepared under Test Preparation into a 19- x 150-mm cuvette and continue as directed under Standard curve beginning with "To each cuvette add 4.0 ml of...". From the standard curve determine the weight, in mg, of tartaric acid in the final dilution, multiply this by 20, and divide the result by the weight of the original sample for obtaining the percentage of tartaric acid.
Total glycerol
Procedure:
Transfer 5.0 ml of Solution I prepared in the test for total Tartaric Acid into a 250-ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer or iodine flask. Add to the flask 15 ml of glacial acetic acid and 25.0 ml of periodic acid solution, prepared by dissolving 2.7 g of periodic acid (H[5]IO[6]) in 50 ml of water, adding 950 ml of glacial acetic acid, and mixing thoroughly; protect this solution from light. Shake the mixture for 1 or 2 min, allow it to stand for 15 min, add 15 ml of potassium iodide solution (15 in 100) and 15 ml of water, swirl, let stand 1 min, and then titrate the liberated iodine with 0.1N sodium thiosulfate, using starch TS as the indicator. Perform a Residual Blank Titration using water in place of the sample. The corrected volume is the number of ml of 0.1N sodium thiosulfate required for the glycerol and the tartaric acid in the sample represented by the 5 ml of Solution I. From the percentage determined in the Assay for Tartaric Acid calculate the volume of 0.1N sodium
thiosulfate required for the tartaric acid in the titration. The difference between the corrected volume and the calculated volume required for the tartaric acid is the number of ml of 0.1N sodium thiosulfate consumed due to the glycerol in the sample. One ml of 0.1N sodium thiosulfate is equivalent to 2.303 mg of glycerol and to 7.505 mg of tartaric acid.

t-Butyl-p-benzoquinone
Apparatus:
Use a suitable double-beam infrared spectrophotometer and matched 0.4 mm liquid sample cells with calcium fluoride windows.
Reagents and Solutions:
Standard preparation: Transfer about 10 mg of mono-tertiary-butyl-p-benzoquinone Reference Standard (available from US Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852, USA), accurately weighed, into a 10-ml volumetric flask, dissolve in chloroform, dilute to volume with the same solvent and mix.
Sample preparation: Transfer about 1 g of the sample, previously ground to a fine powder in a high-speed blender and accurately weighed, into a 10-ml volumetric flask, dissolve in chloroform, dilute to volume with the same solvent, and mix. Filter through a Millipore filter (UHWPO1300), or equivalent, before use in the Procedure below.
Procedure:
Fill the reference cell with chloroform and the sample cell with the Standard preparation. Place the cells in the respective reference and sample beam of the spectrophotometer, and record the infrared spectrum from 1600 to 1775 cm^-1. On the spectrum draw a background line from 1612 to 1750 cm^-1, and determine the net absorbence (A[S]) of the Standard preparation at 1659 cm^-1. Similarly, obtain the spectrum of the sample preparation, and determine its net absorbence (A[U]) at 1659 cm^-1.
Calculation:
Calculate the percent of t-butyl-p-benzoquinone in the sample by the formula:
100 x A[U]/A[S] x W[S]/W[U]
in which W[S] is the exact weight, in mg, of the mono-tertiary-butyl-p-benzoquinone Reference Standard taken;
W[U] is the exact weight, in mg, of the sample taken.
2,5-Di-t-butylhydroquinone and hydroquinone
Apparatus:
Use a suitable gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (F and M Model 810 or equivalent), containing a 0.61-m (2 ft) x 6.35-mm (outside diameter) stainless steel column packed with 20% Silicone SE-30, by weight and 80% Diatoport S (60/80-mesh), or equivalent materials.
Operating conditions:
The operating parameters may vary, depending upon the particular instrument used, but a suitable chromatogram may be obtained using the following conditions:

Reagents and Solutions:
Stock solution: Weigh accurately about 50 mg each of hydroquinone (HQ), 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone (DTBHQ), and methyl benzoate (internal standard), transfer into separate 50-ml volumetric flasks, dilute to volume with pyridine, and mix.
Calibration standards: Into separate 10-ml volumetric flasks add 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 ml of the HQ stock solution, then to each flask add 2 ml of the methyl benzoate (internal standard) stock solution, dilute each to volume with pyridine, and mix. In the same manner prepare four DTBHQ calibrating solutions. Prepare the trimethylsilyl derivative of each solution as follows. Add 9 drops of calibration solution to a 2-ml gas syringe, add 250 m l of N,O-bistrimethylsilylacetamide, and heat at about 80° for 10 min Chromatograph 10-m l portions of each standard in duplicate, and plot the concentration ratio of HQ to internal standard (X-axis) against the response ratio of HQ to internal standard (Y-axis). Plot the same relationships between DTBHQ and the internal standard.
Procedure:
Transfer about 1 g of the sample, accurately weighed, into a 10-ml volumetric flask, add 2 ml of the methyl benzoate internal standard stock solution, dilute to volume with pyridine, and mix. Prepare the trimethylsilyl derivative as described above under Calibration standards, and then chromatograph duplicate 10-m l portions to obtain the chromatogram. The approximate peak times, in minutes, are: methyl benzoate, 2.5; TMS derivative of HQ, 5.5; TMS derivative of tert-butylhydroquinone, 7.3; TMS derivative of DTBHQ, 8.4.
Calculation:
Determine the peak areas (response) of interest by automatic integration or manual triangulation. Calculate the response ratio of HQ and DTBHQ to internal standard. From the calibration curves determine the concentration ratio of HQ and DTBHQ to internal standard, and calculate the % HQ and % DTBHQ in the sample by the formula:
A = Y x I x 10/S
in which A is the % HQ or % DTBHQ in the sample; Y is the concentration ratio (X-axis on calibration curve); I is the percentage (w/v) of internal standard in the Sample preparation; S is the weight of sample taken, in g.

Use a suitable gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (F and M Model 810 or equivalent), containing a 3.66-m (12-ft) x 3.18-mm (outside diameter) stainless steel column packed with 10% Silicone SE-30, by weight, and 90% Diatoport S (60/80 mesh), or equivalent materials.
Operating conditions:
The operating parameters may vary, depending upon the particular instrument used, but a suitable chromatogram may be obtained using the following conditions:
- Column temperature:
programmed from 70 to 280° at 15° per minute and held
- Injection port temperature:
- Cell temperature:
- H[2] and O[2] (or air) settings:
1.4 atm (20 psi) each
Reagents and solutions:
Standard solution: Prepare a solution of toluene in octanol containing approximately 50 m g per ml, and calculate the exact concentration (C[R]) in percent (w/v).
Sample solution: Transfer about 2 g of the sample, accurately weighed, into a 10-ml volumetric flask, dissolve in octanol, dilute to volume with the same solvent, and mix. Calculate the exact concentration of the solution (C[S]) in percent (w/v).
Procedure:
Inject a 5-m l portion of the Standard solution into the chromatograph, and measure the height of the toluene peak (H[R]) on the chromatogram. The toluene retention time is 3.3 min; other peaks are of no interest in this analysis. Similarly, obtain the chromatogram on a 5-m l portion of the Sample solution and of a blank consisting of octanol, and measure the height of the toluene peak (H[S]).
Calculation:
Calculate the mg/kg of toluene in the sample by the formula:
H[S]/C[R] x C[R]/C[S] x 10^6
METHOD OF ASSAY
Transfer about 170 mg of the sample, previously ground to a fine powder and accurately weighed, into a 250-ml wide-mouth conical flask, and dissolve in 10 ml of methanol. Add 150 ml of water, 1 ml of N sulfuric acid, and 4 drops of diphenylamine indicator (3 mg of p-diphenylaminesulfonic acid, sodium salt, per ml of 0.1 N sulfuric acid), and titrate with 0.1 N eerie sulfate to the first complete colour change from yellow to red-violet. Record the volume, in ml, of 0.1 N eerie sulfate required as V. Calculate the percent of C[10]H[14]O[2] in the sample, uncorrected for hydroquinone (HQ) and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (DTBHQ), by the formula:
(V - 0.1 ml) x N x 8.311/W
in which 0.1 ml represents the volume of eerie sulfate consumed by the primary oxidation products of tert-butylhydroquinone ordinarily present in the sample; N is the normality of the standard eerie sulfate solution; W is the weight of the sample taken, in g.
Record the uncorrected percentage thus calculated as A. If HQ and DTBHQ are present in the sample, they will be included in the titration. Calculate the corrected percentage of C[10]H[14]O[2] in the sample by the formula:
A - (%HQ x 1.51) - (%DTBHQ x 0.75)
using the respective values for % HQ and % DTBHQ as determined by the gas chromatographic procedures given above.

SECTION B. Specifications. Certain flavouring agents
ORGANIZATION OF THE SECTION FOR SPECIFICATIONS OF FLAVOURING AGENTS
At its 44th meeting JECFA considered a new approach to the safety evaluation of flavouring agents. This approach incorporates a series of criteria whose use enables the evaluation of a large number of these agents in a consistent and timely manner. At the 46th meeting the Committee applied these procedures to the evaluation of 52 flavouring agents. At the current session of the Committee, the procedure was applied to additional 217 flavouring agents. Specifications of identity and purity were prepared for 164 of these 217 flavouring agents and are documented on the following pages.
The specifications are presented in a tabular format because with the number of flavouring agents now being evaluated, the method of presentation becomes a matter of efficiency. Some of the substances have uses additional to that of being a flavouring agent, for example also serving as a carrier solvent. For these substances the specifications are presented both in the traditional format in Section A and in the tabular format in Section B. Section B, in some cases, contains a reference back to Section A so as to avoid repeating some tests which apply to all uses.
Information on specifications is given under the following headings, most of which are self-explanatory: Name; Chemical name; Synonyms; Flavour and Extract Manufacturer's Association of the United States (FEMA) No; Council of Europe (COE) No; Chemical Abstract Service Registry (CAS) No; Molecular weight; Chemical formula; Physical form/odour; Solubility; Solubility in ethanol*, Boiling point (information only); Identification test (ID), IR infrared spectrum; Assay min%**; Acid value max; Refractive index (at 20°, if not otherwise stated); Specific gravity (at 25°, if not otherwise stated); Other requirements, e.g. additional tests; and last the JECFA column that indicates the Session at which the specifications were prepared, E means "extraction solvent, C means "also used as carrier solvent" (See Section A), P means "preservative, R means "specifications revised", S means "existing specifications maintained, S, T means "existing tentative specifications maintained, N means
"new specifications", and N, T means "new tentative specifications - further information required).
* See General Methods (Guide to JECFA Specifications), FAO Food and Nutrition Paper (FNP) 5/Rev. 2 (1991).
** See Gas chromatographic (GC) Assay of Flavour Chemicals.
Previous specifications of flavouring agents having no other functional uses have been converted to the new tabular format. The tables were generated using Microsoft Excel 5.0.
The infrared spectra, used for identification and comparison purposes, are provided from page 239 onwards, except for those 52 flavouring agents, evaluated at the 46th session of the Committee. For the IR spectra of these substances, see FNP 52 Addendum 4 (1996).
NOTE: Many of the above IR spectra are of unsatisfactory editorial quality. The FAO JECFA Secretariat is exploring ways and means to produce satisfactory and consistent IR spectra when these specifications are printed again.

GAS CHROMATOGRAPHIC (GC) ASSAY OF FLAVOUR CHEMICALS
This procedure applies both to the assay of flavour chemicals and to the quantitation of minor components in flavour chemicals. Analysts following this procedure and performing the test should obtain sufficient resolution of major and even trace components of a mixture to calculate accurately the concentration of the desired component; should be familiar with the general principles, usual techniques, and instrumental variables normally met in gas chromatographic analysis; and should pay particular attention to the following:
1. Stability of baseline, return to baseline before and after each peak of interest, and minimum use of recorder attenuation.
2. Any incompatibility between a sensitive sample component and column support, liquid substrate, or construction material.
3. The response to different components of the same or different detectors. Since sizable errors may be encountered in correlating area percent directly to weight percent, the methods for calculating response factors should be known.
4. Where limits for minor components are specified in the column entitled Other Requirements in the above tabular specifications for flavour chemicals, analysts should use authentic materials to confirm the retention times of minor components. Determine the quantity of components following the instructions below under Calculations and Methods.
GC CONDITIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Column: open tubular capillary column of fused silica or deactivated glass 30 m long x 0.25 to 0.53 mm id
Stationary phase:
1. For a nonpolar column: methyl silicone gum, or equivalent (preferable a bonded and cross-linked dimethyl polysiloxane)
2. For a polar column: polyethylene glycol, or equivalent (preferable a bonded and cross-linked polyethylene glycol)
3. The stationary phase coating should have a thickness of 1 to 3 m m
Carrier gas: helium flowing at a linear velocity of 20 to 40 ml/s
Sample size: 0.1 to 1.0 m l
Split ratio: (for 0.25 mm to 0.35 mm id columns only) 50:1 to 200:1, typically, making sure that no one component exceeds the capacity of the column
Inlet temperature: 225 to 275°
Detector temperature: 250 to 300°
Detectors: use either a thermal conductivity or flame ionization detector operating both as recommended by the manufacturer
Oven program: 50 to 240°, increasing the temperature by 5 °/min, hold at 240° for 5 min
Analysts can also use any GC conditions providing separations equal to (or better than) those obtained with the above method, but in the case of a dispute, the above method must stand.
CALCULATIONS AND METHODS
A. Peak area integration with total area detected normalized to 100%, using electronic integrators: Use an electronic peak integrator in accordance with the manufacture's recommendations, ensuring that the integration parameters permit proper integration of the peaks of a variety of shapes and magnitudes and do not interpret baseline shifts and noise spikes as area contributed by the sample. Use internal or external standards as needed to confirm that the total GC peak area corresponds to 100% of the components present in the sample.
B. Results obtained as described above are based on the assumption that the entire sample has eluted and the peaks of all of the components have been included in the calculation. They will be incorrect if any part of the sample does not elute or if all the peaks are not measured. In such cases, and in all methods described above, the internal standard method may be used to determine percentages based on the total sample. For this method, measurements are required of the peaks of the component(s) being assayed and of the internal standard.
An accurately weighed mixture of the internal standard and the sample is prepared and chromatographed, the area ratio(s) of the component(s) to the standard is computed, and the percentage(s) of the component(s) is calculated.
If this calculation is to be applied, the substance used as the standard should be one that meets the following criteria:
a. Its detector response is similar to that of the component(s) to be determined. In general, the more nearly the chemical structure of the component resembles that of the standard, the closer the response will be.
b. Its retention time is close to, but not identical with, that of the component(s).
c. Its elution time is different from that of any other component in the sample so that its peak does not superimpose on any other.
The weight ratio of the internal standard to the sample should be such that the internal standard and the component sought produce approximately equal peaks. This is, of course, not possible if several components of interest are at different levels of concentration.
If the internal standard method is applied properly, it may be assumed that the ratio of the weight of component to the weight of internal standard is exactly proportional to the peak area ratio, and under these conditions no correction factor is needed. The sample is first run by itself to determine whether the internal standard would mask any component by peak superposition. If there is no interference, a mixture is prepared of the sample and of the internal standard in the specified weight ratio, and the percentages of the internal standard and of the sample in the mixture are calculated. The mixture is chromatogrphed, and the areas of the component peak and the internal standard peak are calculated by one of the methods described above.
The calculations are as follows:
1a. % Component in Mixture/%Internal Standard in Mixture = Component Area/Internal Standard Area, or
1b. % Component in Mixture = % Int. Std. in Mixture x (Component Area/Internal Standard Area)
2. % Component in Sample = (%Component in Mixture x 100)/%Sample in Mixture
Should calibration be necessary, mixtures should be prepared of internal standard and component, of either 100% or of known purity. The number of mixtures and the weight ratios to be used depend on the component being analyzed. Usually, three mixtures will be required. The weight ratio of one is chosen so that the heights of component and standard are equal. The ratios of the other two may be two-thirds and four-thirds of their value. Each mixture should be chromatographed at least three times, and areas calculated. The factor for each chromatograph should be calculated as specified below, and the averages taken for each mixture. An overall average factor is calculated from them. The calibration should be performed periodically.
1. Factor = [(Wt. Component x % Purity)/(Wt. Int. Std. x % Purity)] x [(Int. Std. Area)/Component Area]
2. % Component in Sample Mixture = (Component Area x Factor x % Int. Std. in Sample Mixture)/Int. Std. Area
3. % Component in Sample = (% Component in Sample Mixture x 100)/% Sample in Sample Mixture
GC SYSTEM SUITABILITY TEST SAMPLE
The GC system suitability test sample consists of an equal-weight mixture of food-quality acetophenone, benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, linalool, and hydroxycitronellal.
Using the test sample described below, periodically test the performance of and resolution provided by the gas chromatograph employed. The test sample must display results comparable in quantitative composition, peak shape, and elution order to those specified herein. The quantitative composition should not deviate from the results listed below by more than 10%. Analyze the GC test sample using the GC Conditions for Analysis given above.

The FAO Technical Papers are available through the authorized FAO Sales Agents or directly from Sales and Marketing Group, FAO, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy.
This document is one of the three publications prepared by the forty-ninth session of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), held in Rome in June 1997, and dedicated to the evaluation of food additives and contaminants in food. The report of the meeting will be published in the WHO Technical Report Series and the toxicological monographs as No. 40 in the WHO Food Additives Series. Specifications of certain food additives in this document provide information on their identity and purity. The three main objectives of these specifications are to identify the substance that has been subject to biological testing, to ensure that the substance is of the quality required for safe use in food and to reflect and encourage good manufacturing practice (GMP). This publication will be useful to all who work with or are interested in food additives and their safe use in food.

Thin layer chromatography
Activate some silica gel for 1 h at 110° and prepare a TLC plate. Prepare an 0.02% solution of the sample in dimethylformamide and apply 20 m l to the plate. Allow to dry and develop using a mixture of n-butanol, acetic acid and water (4:1:2 by volume) until the solvent front has ascended about 10 cm. Allow to dry. Carthamin appears as a red spot with an Rf value of about 0.40.
Colour reaction I
Dissolve 10 mg of the sample in 50 ml water. The colour of the solution is red. Add alkali to raise the pH to above 7. The colour changes to orange-yellow.
Colour reaction II
To 0.05 g of the sample add 2 ml of 5% phosphoric acid, heat for 1 h on a water bath. After cooling, filter and wash the residue with 3 ml of water. Combine the filtrate and the washings. Neutralize the combined solution with sodium hydroxide TS, add 5 ml of Fehling's TS and heat on a water bath for 10 min. A red precipitate is produced.
PURITY TESTS
Synthetic dyes
Basic dyes: To 1 g of the sample add 100 ml of 1% sodium hydroxide solution, and mix well. Extract 30 ml of this solution with 15 ml of ether. Then extract the ether layer twice with dilute acetic acid (5 ml); the dilute acetic acid layer does not contain any colour.
Acidic dyes: To 1 g of the sample add 1 ml of ammonia TS and 8 ml of water, and shake well. Discard an oily layer when separated. Proceed as directed (Ascending Chromatography) in the General Methods using 20 m l of the solution as the sample solution, and a mixture of pyridine and ammonia TS (2:1 by volume) as the developing solvent. Stop the development when the solvent front has advanced about 15 cm from the point of application. No spot is observed at the solvent front after drying under daylight. If any spot is observed, it should be decolourized when sprayed with a solution of stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid (2 in 5).
METHOD OF ASSAY
Place about 10 mg of the sample, previously dried and accurately weighed, in a 300-ml ground stoppered flask, add 150 ml of dimethylformamide, dissolve by shaking occasionally and allow stand for 2 hours. Filter this solution through a glass filter into a 200-ml volumetric flask. Wash the flask and filter with two 25-ml portions of dimethylformamide, combine the filtrate and the washings, add dimethylformamide to volume and mix. Determine the absorbance (A) at the maximum absorbance in the range of 525-535 nm using a 1-cm cell. Calculate the content using the absorptivity of carthamus red (information required).

PURITY TESTS
Total acetic acid
Apparatus:
Assemble a modified Hortvet-Sellier distillation apparatus as shown in the figure, using a sufficiently large (approximately 38- x 203-mm) inner Sellier tube and large distillation trap.
Procedure:
Transfer 4 g of sample, accurately weighed into the inner tube of the assembly, and insert the tube in the outer flask containing about 300 ml of recently boiled hot water. To the sample add 10 ml of approximately 4N perchloric acid [35 ml (60g) of 70% perchloric acid in 100 ml of water], and connect the inner tube to a water-cooled condenser through the distillation trap. Distil by heating the outer flask so that 100 ml of distillate is collected within 20 to 25 min. Collect the distillate in 100-ml portions, add phenolphthalein TS to each portion, and titrate with 0.5N sodium hydroxide. Continue the distillation until a 100-ml portion of the distillate requires no more than 0.5 ml of 0.5N sodium hydroxide for neutralization. (Caution: Do not distil to dryness.) Calculate the weight, in mg, of volatile acids in the sample taken by the formula V x e, in which V is the total volume, in ml, of 0.5N sodium hydroxide consumed in the series of titrations and e is the equivalence
factor 30.03.
Total tartaric acid
Standard Curve:
Transfer 100 mg of reagent-grade tartaric acid, accurately weighed, into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dissolve it in about 90 ml of water, add water to volume, and mix well. Transfer 3.0-. 4.0-, 5.0-, and 6.0-ml portions into separate 19- x 150-mm matched cuvettes, and add sufficient water to make 10.0 ml. To each cuvette add 4.0 ml of a freshly prepared 1 in 20 solution of sodium metavanadate and 1.0 ml of acetic acid. (Note: Use these solutions within 10 min after colour development.) Prepare a blank in the same manner, using 10 ml of water in place of the tartaric acid solutions. Set the instrument at zero with the blank, and then determine the absorbance of the four solutions of tartaric acid at 520 nm with a suitable spectrophotometer or a photoelectric colorimeter equipped with a 520-nm filter. From the data thus obtained, prepare a curve by plotting the absorbances on the ordinate against the corresponding quantities, in mg, of the tartaric acid on the abscissa.
Test Preparation:
Transfer about 4 g of the sample, accurately weighed, into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and add 80 ml of approximately 0.5N potassium hydroxide and 0.5 ml of phenolphthalein TS. Connect an air condenser at least 65 cm in length to the flask, and heat the mixture on a hot plate for about 2.5h. Add to the hot mixture approximately 10% phosphoric acid until it is definitely acid to congo red test paper. Reconnect the air condenser, and heat until the fatty acids are liquified and clear. Cool and then transfer the mixture into a 250-ml separator with the aid of small portions of water and chloroform. Extract the liberated fatty acids with three successive 25-ml portions of water, and add the washings to the separator containing the water layer. Transfer the contents of the first separator to a 250-ml beaker, heat on a steam bath to remove traces of chloroform, filter through acid-washed, fine-texture filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask, and finally dilute to volume with
water (Solution I). Pipet 25.0 ml of this solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water (Solution II). Retain the rest of Solution I for the determination of total glycerol.
Procedure:
Transfer 10.0 ml of Solution II prepared under Test Preparation into a 19- x 150-mm cuvette, and continue as directed under Standard Curve, beginning with "To each cuvette add 4.0 ml of a...". From the standard curve determine the weight, in mg, of tartaric acid in the final dilution, multiply this by 20, and divide the result by the weight of the original sample for obtaining the percentage of tartaric acid.
Total glycerol
Procedure:
Transfer 5.0 ml of Solution I prepared in the test for total Tartaric Acid into a 250-ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer or iodine flask. Add to the flask 15 ml of glacial acetic acid and 25,0 ml of periodic acid solution, prepared by dissolving 2.7 g of periodic acid (H[5]IO[6]) in 50 ml of water, adding 950 ml of glacial acetic acid, and mixing thoroughly; protect this solution from light. Shake the mixture for 1 or 2 min, allow it to stand for 15 min, add 15 ml of potassium iodide solution (15 in 100) and 15 ml of water, swirl, let stand 1 min, and then titrate the liberated iodine with 0.1N sodium thiosulfate, using starch TS as the indicator. Perform a Residual Blank Titration using water in place of the sample. The corrected volume is the number of ml of 0.1N sodium thiosulfate required for the glycerol and the tartaric acid in the sample represented by the 5 ml of Solution I. From the percentage determined in the Assay for Tartaric Acid calculate the volume of 0.1N sodium
thiosulfate required for the tartaric acid in the titration. The difference between the corrected volume and the calculated volume required for the tartaric acid is the number of ml of 0. IN sodium thiosulfate consumed due to the glycerol in the sample. One ml of 0. IN sodium thiosulfate is equivalent to 2.303 mg of glycerol and to 7.505 mg of tartaric acid.

Ethylene oxide, dioxane, ethylene chlorohydrin
Principle: Ethylene oxide (EO), ethylene chlorohydrin (EKH) and dioxane are determined by head space gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MSD).
Apparatus: Gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890 or equivalent) equipped with a mass selective detector (Hewlett Packard 5970 or equivalent).
Chromatographic conditions: EKH and dioxane: Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm i.d. DB 5 ms, 0.15 m m (or equivalent). Temperature programmed 40° (2 min), increased to 150° at 15°C/min. Split injection, 150°; Carrier, He, 20 ml/min; interface, 275°; ms dwell time 100 msec.; monitor 43, 44, 57 and 88 amu.
Chromatographic conditions: EO: Column, 50 m, 0.32 mm i.d., CP Sil 5 CB, 5 m m (or equivalent). Temperature programmed 100° (1 min) to 250° at 15°/min. Split injection, 150°; Carrier, He, 20 ml/min.; interface, 275°, ms dwell time 100 msec; monitor 29, 43, 44 and 72 amu.
Regents and Solutions Standards: Accurately weigh approximately 200 mg each of dioxane and EKH and 20 mg EO into a 100 ml volumetric flask containing 50 ml distilled water. Fill to 100 ml. Dilute this standard 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. An internal standard is made by accurately weighing approximately 40 mg of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and diluting to 100 ml with distilled water. A 1:1000 dilution of this solution gives a 0.4 m g/ml standard solution.
Equipment: Headspace vials, 20 ml, with teflon coated septa; gas tight syringe, 1,000 to 2,500 m l; block or oil bath heater, 80°.
Procedure:
Response factors: Accurately weigh 1.0 g of the sample into each of 4 vials, add 0.5 ml of internal standard to each and add 0, 0,2, 0.4, or 0.6 ml of the 1:1000 standards to one of each vial. Add sufficient buffer to bring the total volume in each vial to 1.5 ml. Cap and place vials into the heater at 80° for 20 min. Inject 1.0 ml of the headspace into the GC-MSD. Monitor ions amu 44, EO; 43, MEK; 88, dioxane; 57, EKH. Plot the amount of each compound added to the vial against the ratio of the analyte peak area to the MEK peak area. The response factor, R[f], for each analyte is given by the inverse of the x coefficient of the linear regression of the data.
Analysis: Inject 1 ml headspace of unknowns containing MEK internal standard. Record peak areas of unknowns and the internal standard.
Calculation: The EO, EKH, and dioxane concentrations are calculated from the peak areas in the unknown by the following:
where
A[UNK] ^= area of unknown peak
A[MEK] = area of MEK peak
C[MEK] = concentration of MEK in the sample
R[f] = response factor of the unknown compared to MEK
Mono- and diethylene glycols
Principle: mono- and diethylene glycol are determined by gas chromatography after extraction with acetone.
Apparatus: Gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5980 or equivalent) equipped with an FID detector. Chromatographic conditions: Column, 25 m, 0.52 mm id. CP wax 57 B, 0.5 urn (or equivalent). Temperature programmed 90° (2 min), increased to 250° at 20°/min., final hold, 10 min. Split injection, 250°. Carrier He, 27 ml/min. Injection volume, 1 m l.
Standard solution: Accurately weigh about 20 mg of each glycol into a 25 ml volumetric flask and fill to mark with acetone. This standard is diluted 1:5 and 1:20.
Procedure: Weigh 0.5 g EHEC sample into a 25 ml volumetric flask, add 20 ml acetone, stopper, and stir 2 h at room temperature. Fill flask to volume. Allow the EHEC to settle and inject 1 m l into the chromatograph. Similarly inject 1 m l of the standard solution.
Calculation: The amount of each ethylene glycol is calculated as follows:
where
A[SAM] = peak area of the sample
A[STD] = peak area of standard
C[STD] ^= glycol concentration in the standard (mg/ml)
V[SAM] = volume in which the sample was dissolved
W = weight of the sample in mg
The calculated amount of glycol is divided by 0.75 to account for the 75% recovery of the glycols.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Determination of the ethoxyl group
Principle: The sample is oxidized with chromium trioxide and the ethoxyl groups quantitatively transformed into acetic acid. Acetic acid is distilled and determined by titration.
Reagents:
- 0.020N sodium hydroxide (carbon dioxide-free)
- 0.020N sodium thiosulphate: standardized against 0.020N iodine solution.
- Sodium hydrogen carbonate (analytical grade)
- Aqueous 30% solution of chromium trioxide (analytical grade)
Equipment: The apparatus shown in the following picture is used.
Procedure: Accurately weigh approximately 50 mg of the sample into a 100-ml round bottomed flask; add 10 ml of chromic acid solution and immerse the flask two thirds into an oil bath. The rest of the apparatus is fixed to the flask, and nitrogen is blown through at a rate of 1-2 bubbles per sec. The temperature of the bath is gradually raised over 30 min to 155° and held. Distillation starts at 135-140° When 5 ml has been distilled, 5 ml of boiled distilled water is added from the graduated 50 ml dropping runnel. This procedure is continued until 50 ml of water has been added and consequently 55 ml of faintly yellow distillate has been collected. The distillate is quantitatively transferred to a flask and the distillate is titrated with 0.020N sodium hydroxide (carbon dioxide-free) to a phenolphthalein end-point. The solution is boiled 1 min and cooled to room temperature. The titration is continued until the pink colour remains stable for 10 sec.
About 0.5 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate is added to the titrated solution followed by 10 ml of 10% sulfuric acid. When carbon dioxide evolution has ceased, 1 g of potassium iodide is added; the flask is shaken and kept 5 min in the dark. Liberated iodine is titrated with 0.020N sodium thiosulfate using 1% starch solution as the indicator.
Chromium trioxide solution (10 ml) is distilled and titrated as described above to provide a blank test. It is necessary to run a new blank when a new chromium trioxide solution has been prepared or if changes have been made in the apparatus.
Calculations:
A = ml of sodium hydroxide used
B = ml of sodium thiosulfate used
C = ml of sodium hydroxide used in blank test
D = ml of sodium thiosulfate used in blank test
0.020 = normality of sodium hydroxide and sodium thiosulfate
I = grams of sample (calculated dry and free from ash)
E = C/D
The theoretical value for E is 0.667; in practice it is usually higher (0.7-0.8).
Determination of the total ethoxyl and oxyethylene groups
Principle:
ROC[2]H[5] + HI = ROH + C[2]H[5]I
ROCH[2]CH[2]OH + HI = RI + ICH[2]CH[2]I + 2H[2]O
Ethylene iodide is partly converted to ethylene, partly to ethyl iodide. The former is absorbed in bromine solution, the latter in silver nitrate solution. Ethoxyl groups present in the sample will be transformed to ethyl iodide. Conversion of silver iodide to silver bromide with bromine is carried out, followed by thiosulphate titration of the iodine liberated.
Reagents:
- Hydriodic acid: A constant boiling mixture with water (126-127°) containing 57% HI is made in the following manner: Hypophosphorous acid (10-15 ml) is added to 250 ml of HI and the mixture boiled for 4-5 h under reflux in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The acid is immediately put into 10-ml ampoules of brown glass, which are sealed and stored in a dark place.
- Silver nitrate solution: Silver nitrate (15g) is dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water. The solution is poured into 400 ml of absolute ethanol, and a few drops of cone. nitric acid are added.
- Bromine solution: Bromine (1 ml) is added to 300 ml of glacial acetic acid which is saturated with dried potassium bromide (about 0.23 g per 100 ml of acetic acid).
- Potassium acetate: 100 g is dissolved in a mixture of 900 ml of acetic acid and 100 ml of acetic anhydride.
- Sodium thiosulfate solution 0.1N: Standardized against a 0.1N iodine solution which in turn has been standardized against 0.1N arsenic trioxide solution. Thiosulfate can also be standardized against potassium iodate purchased as a standard
Equipment: The apparatus shown in the figure below is used. Tube A is filled halfway with 6% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and tube B is filled halfway with 10% cadmium sulfate solution. The silver nitrate solution (5 ml) is pipeted into tube C, and 10 ml of the bromine solution is transferred from the first to the second leg by careful tilting of the tube D. Tube E is filled halfway with 20% potassium iodide solution.
Procedure: Weigh 50-60 mg of the sample into the reaction flask, and add 6 ml of hydriodic acid and a few boiling stones. Fix the flask to the apparatus and immerse it in an oil bath at 140-145°. Circulate tap water through the condenser on top of the flask. Pass carbon dioxide through the apparatus at a rate of about 1 bubble per sec. Continue heating about 2 h (the end of the reaction manifests itself by agglomeration of the precipiate in tube C and clearing up of the solution). Five minutes before the end of the analysis, heat tube C to 50-60° in a water bath. Loosen tubes D and E first, and then tube C. Add to tube D, 5 ml of 20% potassium iodide solution. Mix the bromine and the potassium iodide solutions by carefully purging the tube with carbon dioxide. During this whole procedure, tube E must be left connected to tube D. Then transfer the contents of tube D to a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of 20% potassium iodide solution and 50 ml of distilled water.
Rinse tube D well with distilled water, and flood down the contents of tube E in the flask; dilute to 150 ml, and add 5 ml of 10% sulfuric acid. Titrate liberated iodine with 0.05N sodium thiosulfate. Prepare a blank by adding 10 ml of the bromine solution to 10 ml of 20% potassim iodide solution, 150 ml of water, and 5 ml of 10% sulfuric acid and titrate it as described above.
In a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask, mix 15 ml of the potassium acetate solution with 1 ml bromine. Quantitatively transfer the precipitate and solution in tube C into the Erlenmeyer flask. Allow the flask to stand for 10 min, then add 10 ml of the sodium acetate solution. Eliminate the excess of bromine by carefully adding formic acid dropwise. When the colour of the solution has disappeared, add three more drops. (The colour of the precipitate is always slightly yellow; it is necessary, therefore, to let it settle and observe the colour of the solution only). After 3 min, add 3 g of potassium iodide and 15 ml of 10% sulfuric acid, and titrate the liberated iodine with 0.1N sodium thiosulfate using 1% starch solution as the indicator. Prepare and titrate a blank containing reagents only.
Calculations:
where
A = ml of thiosulfate for titration of bromine solution
B = ml of thiosulfate for titration of the blank test on the bromine solution
C = ml of thiosulfate for titration of the silver nitrate solution plus the precipitate
N = normality of thiosulfate solution
I = grams of sample, calculated dry and free from ash
Both hydroxyethoxyl and ethoxyl are reported as ethoxyl.

DEFINITION
Gellan gum is a high molecular weight polysaccharide gum produced by a pure culture fermentation of a carbohydrate by Pseudomonas elodea, purified by recovery with isopropyl alcohol, dried, and milled. The high molecular weight polysaccharide is principally composed of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit of one rhamnose, one glucuronic acid, and two glucose units, and is substituted with acyl (glyceryl and acetyl) groups as the O-glycosidically-linked esters. The glucuronic acid is neutralized to a mixed potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salt. It usually contains a small amount of nitrogen containing compounds resulting from the fermentation procedures..

To the 1% solution of the sample prepared for the previous test, add 0.50 g of sodium chloride, heat to 80° with stirring, and hold at 80° for 1 min. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature. A firm gel is formed.
PURITY TESTS
Isopropyl alcohol
Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) Standard Solution:
Transfer 500.0 mg of chromatographic quality isopropyl alcohol into a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix. Pipet 10 ml of this solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) Standard Solution:
Transfer 500.0 mg of chromatographic quality tert-butyl alcohol into a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix. Pipet 10 ml of this solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Mixed Standard Solution:
Pipet 4 ml each of the IPA standard solution and of the TBA standard solution into a 125-ml graduated Erlenmeyer flask, dilute to about 100 ml with water, and mix. This solution contains approximately 40 m g each of isopropyl alcohol and of tert-butyl alcohol per ml.
Sample preparation:
Disperse 1 ml of a suitable antifoam emulsion, such as Dow-Corning G-10 or equivalent, in 200 ml of water contained in a 1000-ml round-bottom distilling flask. Add about 5 g of the sample, accurately weighed, and shake the flask for 1 h, on a wrist-action mechanical shaker. Connect the flask to a fractionating column and distil about 100 ml; adjust the heat so that foam does not enter the column. Add 4.0 ml of TBA Standard Solution to the distillate to obtain the Sample Preparation.
Procedure:
Inject about 5 m l of the Mixed Standard Solution into a suitable gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and a 1.8-m x 2.3-mm stainless steel column packed with 80/100-mesh Porapak QS or equivalent. The carrier is helium flowing at 80 ml per min. The injection port temperature is 200°, the column temperature 165°, and the detector temperature 200°. The retention time of isopropyl alcohol is about 2 min, and that of tert-butyl alcohol about 3 min.
Determine the areas of the IPA and TBA peaks, and calculate the response factor, f, by the formula A[IPA]/A[TBA], in which A[IPA] is the area of the isopropyl alcohol peak, and A[TBA] is the area of the tert-butyl alcohol peak.
Similarly, inject about 5 m l of the Sample Preparation, and determine the peak areas, recording the area of the isopropyl alcohol peak as a[IPA], and that of the tert-butyl alcohol peak as a[TBA]. Calculate the isopropyl alcohol content, in mg/kg, in the sample taken by the formula:
(a[IPA] x 4000)(f x a[TBA] x W)
in which W is the weight of the sample taken, in g.
Microbiological test
Total plate count: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample into 99 ml of phosphate buffer and use a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve. Limit dissolving time to about 10 min and then pipette 1 ml of the solution into separate, duplicate, appropriately marked petri dishes. Pour over the aliquot of sample in each petri dish 12-15 ml of Plate Count Agar previously tempered to 44-46°. Mix well by alternate rotation and back and forth motion of the plates, allow the agar to solidify. Invert the plates and incubate for 48±2 h at 35±1°.
After incubation count the growing colonies visible on each plate and record the number of colonies. Take the average of both plates, and multiply by the sample dilution factor, 100. Where no colonies are visible, express the result as less than 100 cfu/g.
E. coli determination: Using aseptic technique, disperse 1 g of sample in 99 ml of Lactose broth using either a Stomacher, shaker or stirrer to fully dissolve the sample. Limit the dissolving time to about 15 min and then lightly seal the container and incubate the broth for 18-24 h at 35±1°. Using a sterile pipette, inoculate 1 ml of the incubate into a tube containing 10 ml GN broth. Incubate for 18-24 h and then streak any GN broths showing positive growth or gas production onto duplicate plates of Levine EMB agar. Incubate the plates for 24±2 h at 35±1° and then examine for colonies typical of E. coli i.e. showing strong purple growth with dark centre and a green metallic sheen sometimes spreading onto the agar. Record any typical E. coli colonies as presumptive positive, otherwise negative.
Streak any well isolated suspect colonies onto a plate of PCA and incubate for 18-24 h at 35±1°. Perform a Gram stain on any growth to confirm it is Gram negative. If so, disperse any colony growth into a small volume of 0.85% saline and perform chemical tests to confirm the identity of the bacterial growth. This can most conveniently be done by using API 20E or Micro ID strips or equivalent systems.
After completion of the tests, identify the organism from the Identification manual of the system used and record the final result.

SYNONYMS
Acacia gum, arabic gum;
INS No. 414
DEFINITION
Gum Arabic is a dried exudate obtained from the stems and branches of Acacia senegal (L.) Willdenow or closely related species of Acacia (fam. Leguminosae). A. seyal is a closely related species. Gum arabic consists mainly of high-molecular weight polysaccharides and their calcium, magnesium, and potassium salts, which on hydrolysis yield arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid. Items of commerce may contain extraneous materials such as sand and pieces of bark which must be removed before use in food. Gum arabic from A. seyal is sometimes referred to as gum talha.
C.A.S. number
DESCRIPTION
Gum Arabic from A. senegal is a pale white to orange-brown solid, which breaks with a glassy fracture. The best grades are in the form of whole, spheroidal tears of varying size with a matte surface texture. When ground, the pieces are paler and have a glassy appearance. Gum from other acacia species may not have the characteristic tear shape and are often darker in colour. Gum from A. seyal is more brittle than the hard tears of A. senegal. Gum arabic is also available commercially in the form of white to yellowish-white flakes, granules, powder, roller-dried, or spray-dried material.

Hydrolysis products
Identify arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid as follows:
Boil a mixture of 100 mg of the sample and 20 ml of 10% sulfuric acid for 3h. Allow to cool and add excess barium carbonate, mixing with a magnetic stirrer until the solution is of pH 7, and filter. Evaporate the filtrate in a rotary evaporator at 30-50° in vacuum until a crystalline or syrupy residue is obtained. Dissolve in 10 ml of 40% methanol. This is the hydrolysate.
Place 1 to 10 m l spots of the hydrolysate on the starting line of two chromatoplates and spots containing 1 to 10 m g of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid, expected to be present in the hydrolysate. Use two solvent systems one for each plate: A. a mixture of formic acid, methyl ethyl ketone, tertiary butanol and water (15:30:40:15 by volume) and B. a mixture of isopropanol, pyridine, acetic acid and water (40:40:5:20 by volume) to develop the plates. After development, spray with a solution of 1.23 g anisidine and 1.66 g phthalic acid in 100 ml ethanol and heat the plates at 100° for 10 min. A greenish yellow colour is produced with hexoses, a red colour with pentoses and a brown colour with uronic acids. Compare sample spots with those for the solutions of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid. Additional spots corresponding to mannose, xylose, and galacturonic acid should be absent.

TESTS
Maltogenic amylase activity
The method is based on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze maltotriose to maltose and glucose. The reaction is stopped by raising the pH of the reaction medium to about 11. The formed glucose is converted to gluconolactone by glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD^+ which is converted to NADH^+H^+. The change in the concentration of NAD^+ is measured photometrically at 340 nm. One enzyme unit (Maltogenic Amylase Unit, MAU) is defined as the amount of enzyme which under standard assay conditions cleaves 1 m mol of maltotriose per minute. Assay conditions being as follows: Substrate concentration 10 mg/ml; temperature 37°; pH 5.0; incubation time 30 min.
Preparation of 20 mg/ml-maltotriose substrate:
Dissolve 1000 mg maltotriose (e.g. Sigma M8378) in 0.1M citrate buffer, pH 5.0, making a total volume of 50 ml (to be prepared each day of analysis).
Preparation of glucose dehydrogenase (GluDH) reagent:
Add buffer solution (Merck No. 14051 or equivalent) to the enzyme mixture (Merck No. 14055, bottles "1" and "2", or equivalent). Allow the mixture to stand for 15 min. Transfer the solution to a 500 ml volumetric flask, containing 200 ml of 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 5.0. Fill the flask to the mark with the same buffer. This solution can be stored for two weeks at room temperature (not in a refrigerator).
Preparation of standard enzyme solutions:
Dilute a maltogenic amylase standard with known activity in 10 mM NaCl to give the following enzyme units per ml: 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, 0.060 and 0.075.
Measurement of enzyme activity:
Add 500 m l of substrate solution (20 mg/ml maltotriose, prepared in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0, pre-warmed to 37°) to an equal volume of enzyme solution also pre-warmed to 37°. Mix the resulting solution thoroughly and transfer to a water bath maintained at 37°. After 30 minutes remove the test tube from the water bath, and add 1000 m l of the stop reagent (0.06N NaOH) and shake vigorously. Add 3 ml of GluDH reagent and mix again. Leave the test tube at room temperature for exactly 30 min and measure optical density (OD) at 340 nm. Prepare a blank in a similar manner except that the stop reagent is added before the substrate.
Calculation of enzyme activity:
Draw the enzyme standard curve in a coordinate system using enzyme activity (MAU/ml) as the abscissa and D OD (sample - blank) as the ordinate. Calculate the activity of the sample by reading D OD of sample dilutions on the standard curve and then multiplying by the corresponding dilution factors. The standard curve is a straight line passing through the origin and linear regression can therefore be applied.
Basic standardisation:
Glucose solutions:
a) Stock solution: Accurately weigh 1.60 g of glucose, analytical grade, in a 1000-ml volumetric flask and make up to volume with demineralized water.
b) standard solutions: Dilute 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 ml of stock solution to volume with deionized water in 100-ml volumetric flask to give standard solutions of 88.8, 178, 266, 355, 444 and 533 m mol/l.
Standard curve:
Prepare the glucose standard curve by mixing 2.0 ml glucose solution with 3.0 ml GluDH reagent and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. Read OD at 340 nm. Prepare a common blank using demineralized water instead of glucose solution. Plot glucose concentration (m mol/l) versus D OD.
Calculation:
Calculate the enzyme activity by reading the equivalent glucose concentration on the standard curve and inserting it in the following formula:
where:
A = reading on the standard curve, m mol/l
F = dilution factor of the enzyme solution, ml/g
4 = the ratio between amount of enzyme dilution in sample and amount of glucose solution in standard
30 = incubation time, 30 min
1000 = conversion from litre to ml

Melting range
Melt a quantity of the substance slowly, while stirring, until it reaches a temperature of 90° or higher to completely melt the substance. Remove the source of heat, and allow the molten substance to cool to a temperature of 8 to 10° above the expected melting point. Chill the bulb of an ASTM 14C (American Society for Testing and Materials) or equal thermometer to 5°, wipe it dry and while it is still cold dip into the molten substance so that approximately the lower half of the bulb is submerged. Withdraw it immediately, and hold it vertically away from the heat until the wax surface dulls, then dip it for 5 min into a water bath having a temperature not higher than 16°.
Fix the thermometer securely in a test tube so that the lower point is 15 mm above the bottom of the test tube. Suspend the test tube in a water bath adjusted to about 16°, and raise the temperature of the bath a the rate of 2° per min to 30°, then change to a rate of 1° per min and note the temperature at which the first drop of melted substance leaves the thermometer. Repeat the determination twice on a freshly melted portion of the sample. If the variation of three determinations is less than 1°, take the average of the three as the melting point. If the variation of the three determinations is greater than 1°, make two additional determinations and take the average of the five.
PURITY TESTS

Carbon number at 5% distillation point
"Carbon number" is number of carbon atoms in a molecule. Determine the carbon number distribution of the sample using the method as described in ASTM D 5442.
NOTE: By optimizing the length of separation column and/or column temperature, waxes with carbon number higher than 45 can also be included.
The combined contents of components with carbon number less than 25 is not more than 5%.
Average molecular weight
Using the carbon number distribution obtained in the test for "Carbon number at 5% distillation point" calculate the average molecular weight by the following formula:
where
i = the carbon number
C[i] is the content in % of components having a carbon number of i
Residue on ignition
Accurately weigh about 2 g of the sample in a tared porcelain or platinum dish and heat over a flame. The sample volatilizes without emitting an acrid odour. Ignite to not exceeding a very dull redness until free from carbon. Cool in a desiccator and weigh.
Colour
Melt about 10 g of the sample on a steam bath, and pour 5 ml of the liquid into a clear-glass, 16 x 150-mm bacteriological test tube: the warm, melted liquid is not darker than a solution made by mixing 3.8 ml of ferric chloride TS and 1.2 ml of cobaltous chloride TS in a similar tube, the comparison of the two being made in reflected light against a white background, the tubes being held directly against the background at such an angle that there is no fluorescence.
Sulfur

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
General Instructions
Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is a recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of wax samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.
Apparatus
- Separatory funnels: 250-ml, 500-ml, 1,000-ml, and preferably 2000-ml capacity, equipped with tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks.
- Reservoir: 500-ml capacity, equipped with a 24/40 standard taper male fitting at the bottom and a suitable balljoint at the top for connecting to the nitrogen supply. The male fitting should be equipped with glass hooks.

- Suction flask: 250-ml or 500-ml filter flask.
- Condenser: 24/40 joints, fitted with a drying tube, length optional.
- Evaporation flask (optional): 250-ml or 500-ml capacity all-glass flask equipped with standard taper stopper having inlet and outlet tubes permitting passage of nitrogen across the surface of the liquid to be evaporated.
- Vacuum distillation assembly: All glass (for purification of dimethyl sulfoxide); 2 litre distillation flask with heating mantle; Vigreaux vacuum-jacketed condenser (or equivalent) about 45 cm in length and distilling head with separable cold finger condenser. Use of tetrafluoroethylene polymer sleeves on the glass joints will prevent freezing. Do not use grease on stopcocks or joints.
- Spectrophotometric cells: Fused quartz cells, optical path length in the range of 5.000 ± 0.005 cm; also for checking spectrophotometer performance only, optical path length in the range 1.000 ± 0.005 cm. With distilled water in the cells, determine any absorbance differences.

Reagents and materials
- Organic solvents: All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane, benzene, acetone, and methyl alcohol designated in the list following this paragraph shall pass the following test:
To the specified quantity of solvent in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 ml of purified n-hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a loose aluminium foil jacket around the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 ml of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene add a 10 ml portion of purified isooctane, re-evaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene).
Alternatively, the evaporation time can be reduced by using the optional evaporation flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet tube while the outlet tube is connected to a solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way as to prevent any flow-back of condensate into the flask.
Dissolve the 1 ml of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 ml volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5 cm path length cells compared to isooactane as reference. The absorbance of the solution of the solvent residue (except for methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per cm path length between 280 and 400 nm. For methyl alcohol this absorbance value shall be 0.00.
- Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane): Use 180 ml for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel, grade 12, Davison Chemical Company, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, or equivalent, about 90 cm in length and 5 cm to 8 cm in diameter.
- Benzene, reagent grade: Use 150 ml for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.
- Acetone, reagent grade: Use 200 ml for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.

2. 20% benzene in isooctane: Pipet 50 ml of benzene into a 250-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and adjust to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
3. Acetone-benzene-water mixture: Add 20 ml of water to 380 ml of acetone and 200 ml of benzene, and mix.
- n-Hexadecane, 99% olefin-free: Dilute 1.0 ml of n-hexadecane to 25 ml with isooctane and determine the absorbance in a 5-cm cell compared to isooctane as reference point between 280-400 nm. The absorbance per centimeter path length shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. Purify, if necessary, by percolation through activated silica gel or by distillation.
- Methyl alcohol, reagent grade: Use 10.0 ml of methyl alcohol. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.
- Dimethyl sulfoxide: Pure grade, clear, water-white, m.p. 18° minimum. Dilute 120 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240 ml of distilled water in a 500-ml separatory funnel, mix and allow to cool for 5-10 min. Add 40 ml of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigourously for 2 min. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-ml separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 ml of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 40-ml extracts three times with 50 ml portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extract through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter), into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 40-ml isooctane extract, and pass through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Then wash
the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 10 ml portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 ml of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10 ml portion of isooctane and re-evaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane. Again, add 10 ml of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the 1 ml of hexadecane in isooctane and make to 25 ml volume. Determine the absorbance in 5 cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution should not exceed 0.02 per cm path length in the 280-400 nm range. (Note - Difficulty in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic impurities in the distilled water. Repetition of the test omitting the dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If
necessary to meet the specification, purify the water by redistillation, passage through an ion-exchange resin, or otherwise).
Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1.5 litre of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-litre glass-stoppered flask, add 6.0 ml of phosphoric acid and 50 g of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated bar) stir the solvent for 15 min. Filter the dimethyl sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted paper (18.5 cm), Schleicher & Schuell No. 597, or equivalent. If the initial filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter through the same filter until a clear filtrate is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the filtrate to a 2-litre separatory funnel and draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2-litre distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3-mm Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-ml
fraction of the distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one.
Continue the distillation until approximately 1 litre of the sulfoxide has been collected.
At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will react with some metal containers in the presence of air.
Phosphoric acid, 85% reagent grade
- Sodium borohydride, 98%
- Magnesium oxide (Sea Sorb 43, Food Machinery Company, Westvaco Division distributed by chemical supplier firms, or equivalent): Place 100 g of the magnesium oxide in a large beaker, add 700 ml of distilled water to make a thin slurry, and heat on a steam bath for 30 min with intermittent stirring. Stir well initially to insure that all the absorbent is completely wetted. Using a Buchner funnel and a filter paper of suitable diameter, filter with suction. Continue suction until water no longer drips from the runnel. Transfer the absorbent to a glass trough lined with aluminium foil (free from rolling oil). Break up the magnesia with a clean spatula and spread out the absorbent on the aluminium foil in a layer about 1-2 cm thick. Dry at 160±1° for 24h. Pulverize the magnesia with mortar and pestle. Sieve the pulverized absorbent between 60-180 mesh. Use the magnesia retained on the 180-mesh sieve.

Shake vigorously for 10 min. Transfer the mixture to a glass trough lined with aluminium foil (free from rolling oil) and spread it out on a layer about 1 to 2 cm thick. Reheat the mixture at 160±10 for 2 h, and store in a tightly closed flask.
- Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, reagent grade, preferably in granular form: For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30 ml coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65 ml filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15 ml portions of the indicated solvent until a 15 ml portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per cm path length between 280 nm and 400 nm when tested as prescribed under "Organic solvents." Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.
Procedure
Before proceeding with the analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5 cm path cell between 250 nm and 400 nm for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a wax sample, at room temperature, recording the spectra after the extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter path length following the extraction stage should not exceed 0.040 in the wavelength range from 250 to 400 nm; the absorbance per cm path length following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.070 in the wavelength range from 250 to 299 nm, inclusive, nor 0.045 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 400 nm. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250-260 nm region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure under "Organic solvents" and record absorbance again.
Place 300 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-litre separatory funnel and add 75 ml of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel and allow to stand for 10 min. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep runnel stoppered). Add 150 ml of isooctane and shake to pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
Place a representative 1-kg sample of wax, or if this amount is not available, the entire sample, in a beaker of a capacity about three times the volume of the sample and heat with occasional stirring on a steam bath until the wax is completely melted and homogenous. Weigh four 25 ± 0.2 g portions of the melted wax in separate 100 ml beakers. Reserve three of the portions for later replicate analyses as necessary. Pour one weighed portion immediately after remelting (on the steam bath) into a 500 ml separatory funnel containing 100 ml of the pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture that has been heated in the heating jacket at a temperature just high enough to keep the wax melted. (Note: In pre-heating the sulfoxide-acid mixture, remove the stopper of the separatory funnel at intervals to release the pressure).
Promptly complete the transfer of the sample to the funnel in the jacket with portions of the pre-equilibrated isooctane, warming the beaker, if necessary, and using a total volume of just 50 ml of the solvent. If the wax comes out of solution during these operations, let the stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves. (Remove stopper from the funnel at intervals to release pressure).
When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it vigorously for 2 min. Set up three 250-ml separatory funnels with each containing 30 ml of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After separation of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the main portion of the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl the funnel when precipitation first occurs on the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw off the lower layer, filter it slowly through a thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a filter runnel into the first 250-ml separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the 30-ml portions of isooctane contained in the 250-ml separatory runnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after each extraction to keep the wax in solution and washing each extractive in tandem through the same three
portions of isooctane.
Collect the successive extracts (300 ml total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-litre), containing 480 ml of distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extract has been added. Add 80 ml of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 min. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-litre) and repeat the extraction with 80 ml of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80-ml extracts three times with 100-ml portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extract through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter) into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80-ml isooctane extract and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash
the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-ml portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 ml of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-ml portions of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once more.
Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-ml volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5-cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280-400 nm (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in the Characteristics, the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If the corrected absorbance per centimeter path length exceeds the limits prescribed in the Characteristics, proceed as follows:
Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to a 125-ml flask equipped with 24/40 joint and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 1 ml of hexadecane. Add 10 ml of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 g of sodium borohydride (Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be used). Immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a drying tube into the flask, mix until the borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand for 30 min at room temperature, with intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins to come out of the solution. Then add 10 ml of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2-3 ml. Again, add 10 ml of isooctane and concentrate to a volume of approximately 5 ml. Swirl the flask repeatedly to assure adequate washing of the sodium
borohydride residues.
Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem of the chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction flask and apply the vaccum (approximately 135-mm Hg pressure). Weigh out 14 g of the 2+1 magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and pour the adsorbent mixture into the chromatographic tube in approximately 3 cm layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few ml of each adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 14 g of the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 cm in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500-ml reservoir onto
the top of the chromatographic column and pre-wet the column by passing 100 ml of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that the rate of descent of the isooctane coming off of the column is between 2-3 ml per min. Discontinue pressure just before the last of the isooctane reaches the level of the adsorbent. (Caution: Do not allow the liquid level to recede below the adsorbent level at any time). Remove the reservoir and decant the 5 ml isooctane concentrate solution onto the column and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with two 5 ml portions of isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5 ml wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 ml of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2-3 ml per minute rate. Just before the last of the isooctane reaches the
adsorbent level, add 100 ml of 10% benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the aforementioned rate. Just before the solvent mixture reaches adsorbent level, add 25 ml of 20% benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at 2-3 ml per minute until all this solvent mixture has been removed from the column. Discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point. Add 300 ml of the acetone-benzene-water mixture to the reservoir and percolate through the column to elute the polynuclear compounds. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-litre separatory funnel. Allow the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three times with 300 ml portions of distilled water, shaking well for each wash. (The addition of small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates separation). Discard the aqueous layer after each wash. After the final separation, filter the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate
pre-washed with benzene (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter) into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the separatory funnel with two additional 20 ml portions of benzene which are also filtered through the sodium sulfate. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under "Organic Solvents". Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-ml volumetric flask and adjust the volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5 cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 - 400 nm. Correct for any absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 - 260 nm region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under
"Organic Solvents". Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25-ml volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in the Characteristics the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.

DEFINITION
Food starches which have one or more of their original characteristics altered by treatment in accordance with good manufacturing practice by one of the procedures listed in Table 1. In the case of starches treated with heat in the presence of acid or with alkali, the alteration is a minor fragmentation. When the starch is bleached, the change is essentially in the colour only. Oxidation involves the deliberate production of carboxyl groups. Treatment with reagents such as orthophosphoric acid results in partial substitution in the 2,6- or 3- position of the anhydroglucose unit unless the 6-position is occupied for branching. In cases of cross-bonding, where a polyfunctional substituting agent, such as phosphorus oxychloride, connects two chains, the structure can be represented by: Starch-O-R-O-Starch, where R = cross-bonding group and Starch refers to the linear and/or branched structure. The article of commerce can be specified by the parameter specific for the particular
type of modification as indicated in Column 3 of Table 1, and may also be further specified as to the loss on drying, sulfated ash, protein and fat.

IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Microscopy
Modified starches which have not been pregelatinized retain their granular structure and can be identified as starches by microscopic observation. Shape, size and sometimes striations are characteristics of the botanical origin. In polarized light under crossed nicol prisms the typical polarization cross will be observed
Iodine stain
Add a few drops of 0.1 N potassium tri-iodide to an aqueous suspension of the sample. These starches stain with iodine in the same way as native starches. The colour can range from dark blue to red
Copper reduction
Place about 2.5 g of the sample previously washed with water, in a boiling flask, add 10 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid (3%) and 70 ml of water, mix, reflux for about three hours and cool. Add 0.5 ml of the resulting solution to 5 ml of hot alkaline cupric tartrate TS. A copious red precipitate is produced
Differentiation test
To differentiate between various treated starches perform the following tests:
1. Test for hypochlorite-oxidized starch (not for slightly oxidized potato starch)
Principle:
Because of the carboxyl group content, hypochlorite-oxidized starch has anionic properties. It can be dyed with positively charged dyes such as methylene blue.
Procedure:
50 mg of the sample are kept in suspension for 5-10 min in 25 ml of a 1% aqueous dye solution and stirred occasionally. After decantation of the excess solution, the starch is washed with distilled water. Microscopic inspection clearly shows colouring, if the sample is hypochlorite-oxidized starch. By this test hypochlorite-oxidized starch is distinguished from native and acid modified starch of the same botanical origin.
2. Specific reaction of acetyl groups
Principle:
Acetate is liberated upon saponification of acetylated starch. After concentration the acetate is converted to acetone by heating with calcium hydroxide. The acetone thus produced stains blue with o-nitrobenzaldehyde.
Procedure:
About 10 g of the sample is suspended in 25 ml water to which is added 20 ml of 0.4 N NaOH. After shaking for 1 h the starch is filtered off and the filtrate evaporated in an oven at 110°. The residue is dissolved in a few drops of water and transferred to the test tube. Calcium hydroxide is added and if the sample is an acetylated starch, the tube heated thereby gives off acetone vapours. These produce a blue colour on a paper strip soaked in a fresh saturated solution of o-nitrobenzaldehyde in 2 N NaOH. The blue colour is more distinct when the original yellow colour of the reagents is removed with 1 drop of a 1 in 10 solution of hydrochloric acid.
3. Positive test for ester groups
The infrared spectrum of a thin film gives a typical absorption band at about 1720 cm^-1 which is an indication for ester groups. The limit of detection is about 0.5% acetyl, adipyl or succinyl groups in the product.
PURITY TESTS
Sulfur dioxide
Scope:
The method is applicable, with minor modifications, to liquid or solid samples even in the presence of other volatile sulfur compounds.
Principle:
The sulfur dioxide is released from the sample in a boiling acid medium and is removed by a stream of carbon dioxide. The separated gas is collected in dilute hydrogen peroxide where it is oxidized to sulfuric acid and titrated with standard alkali. Alternatively, the sulfuric acid may be determined gravimetrically.
Apparatus:
"Monier-Williams" apparatus for the determination of sulfurous acid, constructed with standard-taper glass connections, can be obtained from any reliable scientific glass apparatus store. It is customary, however, to construct the apparatus with regular laboratory glassware using stopper connections (see Figure 1).
Figure 1
The assembly consists of a 1000-ml two-neck round-bottom boiling flask to which a gas-inlet tube, a 60-ml dropping funnel having a 2-mm bore stopcock, and a sloping Allihn reflux condenser are attached. A delivery tube connects the upper end of the condenser to the bottom of a 250-ml conical receiving flask, which is followed by a Peligot tube.
In operation, carbon dioxide is passed through the scrubber and bubbled through the heated reaction mixture, sweeping sulfur dioxide through the condenser and into the receivers where it is absorbed quantitatively.
Preparation of solutions:
Sodium carbonate solution: Dissolve approximately 15 g of Na[2]CO[3] or 40 g of Na[2]CO[3] · 10H[2]O in distilled water, and dilute to 100 ml.
Hydrogen peroxide, 3%: Dilute 10 ml of C.P. (Chemical Purity) neutral 30% hydrogen peroxide (H[2]O[2]) with distilled water to 100 ml.
Procedure:
Pass carbon dioxide from a generator or cylinder through the sodium carbonate scrubber solution to remove chlorine, thence into the gas-inlet tube of the boiling flask. Place 15 ml of the 3% hydrogen peroxide in the receiving flask and 5 ml in the Peligot tube. Connect the apparatus and introduce into the boiling flask, by means of the dropping funnel, 300 ml of distilled water and 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Boil the contents approximately 10 min in a current of carbon dioxide. Weigh, to the nearest g, 100 g of the sample and disperse in approximately 300 ml of recently-boiled distilled water. Transfer the slurry to the boiling flask by means of dropping funnel, regulating the sample addition rate and the gas flow rate through the apparatus to prevent drawback of hydrogen peroxide, inclusion of air, or burning of sample. Boil the mixture gently for 1 h in a slow current of carbon dioxide. Stop the flow of water in the condenser just before the end of the
distillation. When the delivery tube just above the receiving flask becomes hot, remove the tube from the condenser immediately. Wash the delivery tube and the Peligot tube contents into the receiving flask, and titrate with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, using bromphenol blue indicator (see Note).
Perform a blank determination on the reagents, and correct results accordingly.

Determine the pH of the resulting suspension by the method outlined in General Methods.
Carboxyl groups
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1.
Principle:
The carboxyl containing starch is leached with mineral acid to convert carboxyl salts to the acid form. Cations and excess acid are removed by washing with water. The washed sample is gelatinized in water and titrated with standard alkali.
Note: Native phosphate groups present in potato starch increase the titre found in this method (See note 6)
Reagents:
Hydrochloric Acid Solution, 0.10 N: Standardization unnecessary
Sodium Hydroxide Solution, 0.10 N: Standardized
Phenolphthalein Indicator, 1%
Procedure:
If necessary, grind sample completely through a laboratory cutting mill to 20 mesh or finer, taking precautions to prevent any significant change in moisture, and mix thoroughly.
Weigh accurately a sample containing not more than 0.25 milli-equivalent of carboxyl (Note 1), and transfer quantitatively to a 150-ml beaker. Add 25 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and stir occasionally over a period of 30 min. Vacuum filter the slurry through a medium porosity fritted-glass crucible or small funnel, using a fine stream of water from a wash bottle to aid quantitative transfer of the sample. Wash the sample with distilled water (300 ml usually sufficient) until the filtrate is free from chloride determined by silver nitrate test (Note 2).
Transfer the demineralized sample quantitatively to a 600 ml beaker with the aid of distilled water, and slurry the sample in 300 ml of distilled water. Heat sample dispersion in a steam bath or boiling water bath (Note 3), stirring continuously until the starch gelatinizes, and continue heating for 15 min to ensure complete gelatinization (Note 4).
Remove sample from bath and titrate while hot with standard 0.10 N sodium hydroxide solution to a phenolphthalein end-point. The end-point may be detected electrometrically at pH 8.3. A blank determination is run on the original sample to correct for native acid substances (Note 5). Weigh the same quantity of starch as taken for carboxyl titration, and slurry in 10 ml of distilled water. Stir at about 5-min intervals for 30 min.
Vacuum filter the slurry quantitatively through a medium porosity fritted-glass crucible or small funnel, and wash sample with 200 ml of distilled water. Transfer, gelatinize, and titrate the sample with standard 0.10 N sodium hydroxide in the same manner as the demineralized sample.

Notes and Precautions:
1. Sample size should not exceed 5.0 g for a mildly oxidized nor less than 0.15 g for a highly oxidized commercial starch.
2. Add 1 ml of 1% aqueous silver nitrate solution to 5 ml of filtrate. Turbidity or precipitation occurs within 1 min if chloride is present.
3. Heating on a hot plate or over a Bunsen burner is not recommended. Over-heating or scorching in amounts too small to be visible will cause sample decomposition and apparent high carboxyl results.
4. Thorough gelatinization facilitates rapid titration and accurate end-point detection.
5. A blank titration is run on a water washed sample to correct for acidic components which are not introduced by oxidation or derivatization. Free fatty acids complexed with amylose in common corn starch are the principal contributors to the blank titer.
6. A correction for phosphate content in potato starch (deduction) should be made after determining the phosphorus content of the sample being examined.
The deduction is calculated:
where:
P = phosphorus content (%)
Manganese content
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1.
Instrumentation:
Determine the manganese content with the use of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer at 279.5 nm.
Preparation of solutions:
- Standard solution: Prepare a solution containing 0.5 mg/l of manganese.
- Sample solution: Transfer 10.000 g of the sample into a 200-ml Kohlrausch volumetric flask, previously rinsed with 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, add 140 ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, and shake vigorously for 15 min, preferably with a mechanical shaker. Dilute to volume with 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, and shake. Centrifuge approximately 100 ml of the mixture in a heavy-walled centrifuge tube at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and use the clear supernatant liquid in the following "procedure".
Procedure:
Aspirate distilled water through the air-acetylene burner for 5 min and obtain a base-line reading at 279.5 nm, following the manufacturer's instructions for operating the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. In the same manner aspirate a portion of the "Standard solution" and note the reading. Finally, aspirate the "Sample solution" and compare the reading with the reading for the "Standard solution", and multiply this value by 20 to obtain mg per kg of Mn in the original sample taken for analysis.
Phosphorus content
As specified in the Column 3 of Table 1.
Reagents:
- Ammonium Molybdate Solution (5%): Dissolve 50 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, (NH[4])[6]Mo[7]O[24] · 4H[2]O, in 900 ml of warm water, cool to room temperature, dilute to 1000 ml with water, and mix.
- Ammonium Vanadate Solution (0.25%): Dissolve 2.5 of ammonium metavanadate, NH[4]VO[3], in 600 ml of boiling water, cool to 60 - 70°, and add 20 ml of nitric acid. Cool to room temperature, dilute to 1000 ml with water, and mix.
- Zinc Acetate Solution (10%): Dissolve 120 g of zinc acetate dihydrate, Zn(C[2]H[3]O[2])[2] · 2H[2]O, in 880 ml of water, and filter through Whatman No. 2V or equivalent filter paper before use.
- Nitric Acid Solution (29%): Add 300 ml of nitric acid (sp. gr 1.42) to 600 ml of water, and mix.
- Standard Phosphorus Solution: (100 m g P in 1 ml): Dissolve 438.7 mg of monobasic potassium phosphate, KH[2]PO[4], in water in a 1000-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix.
Standard Curve:
Pipet 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 ml of the Standard Phosphorus Solution into separate 100 ml volumetric flasks. To each of these flasks, and to a fourth blank flask, add in the order stated 10 ml of Nitric Acid Solution, 10 ml of Ammonium Vanadate Solution, and 10 ml of Ammonium Molybdate
Solution, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Dilute to volume with water, mix, and allow to stand for 10 min. Determine the absorbance of each standard solution in a 1 cm cell at 460 nm, with a suitable spectrophotometer, using the blank to set the instrument at zero. Prepare a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of each solution versus its concentration, in mg P per 100 ml.
Sample Pretreatment:
Place 20 to 25 g of the starch sample in a 250 ml beaker, add 200 ml of a 7 to 3 methanol-water mixture, disperse the sample, and agitate mechanically for 15 min. Recover the starch by vacuum filtration in a 150 ml medium-porosity fritted-glass or Buchner runnel, and wash the wet cake with 200 ml of the methanol-water mixture. Reslurry the wet cake in the solvent, and wash it a second time in the same manner. Dry the filter cake in an air oven at a temperature below 50°, then grind the sample to 20-mesh or finer, and blend thoroughly. Determine the amount of dry substance by drying a 5 g portion in a vacuum oven, not exceeding 100 mm of Hg, at 120° for 5h. (NOTE: The treatment outlined above is satisfactory for starch products that are insoluble in cold water.
For pregelatinized starch and other water-soluble starches, prepare a 1% to 2% aqueous paste, place it in a cellophane tube, and dialyze against running distilled water for 30 to 40h. Precipitate the starch by pouring the solution into 4 volumes of acetone per volume of paste, while stirring. Recover the starch by vacuum filtration in a medium-porosity fritted-glass or Buchner runnel, and wash the filter cake with absolute ethanol. Dry the filter cake, and determine the amount of dry substance as directed for water-insoluble starches).
Sample preparation:
Transfer about 10 g of the Treated Sample, calculated on the dry-substance and accurately weighed, into a Vycor dish, and add 10 ml of Zinc Acetate Solution in a fine stream, distributing the solution uniformly in the sample. Carefully evaporate to dryness on a hot plate, then increase the heat, and carbonize the sample on the hot plate or over a gas flame. Ignite in a muffle furnace at 550° until the ash is free from carbon (about 1 to 2h), and cool. Wet the ash with 15 ml of water and wash slowly down the sides of the dish with 5 ml of Nitric Acid Solution. Heat to boiling, cool, and quantitatively transfer the mixture into a 200-ml volumetric flask, rinsing the dish with three 20-ml portions of water and adding the rinsings to the flask. Dilute to volume with water, and mix. Transfer an accurately measured aliquot (V, in ml) of this solution, containing not more than 1.5 mg of phosphorus, into a 100-ml volumetric flask and add 10 ml of Nitric Acid Solution, 10 ml of
Ammonium Vanadate Solution, and 10 ml of Ammonium Molybdate Solution, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Dilute to volume with water, mix, and allow to stand for 10 min.
Procedure:
Determine the absorbance of the Sample Preparation in a 1 cm cell at 460 nm, with a suitable spectrophotometer, using the blank to set the instrument at zero. From the Standard Curve, determine the mg of phosphorus in the aliquot taken, recording this value as a. Calculate the amount in mg/kg of Phosphorus (P) in the original sample by the formula:
in which W is the weight of the sample taken, in g.
Acetyl groups content
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1.
Accurately weigh about 5 g of the sample and transfer into a 250 ml conical flask. Suspend in 50 ml of water, add a few drops of phenolphthalein TS, and titrate with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide to a permanent pink end-point. Add 25.0 ml of 0.45 N sodium hydroxide, stopper the flask, and shake vigorously for 30 min, preferably with a mechanical shaker. (NOTE: the temperature should not exceed 30° or some starches may gelatinise). Remove the stopper, wash the stopper and sides of the flask with a few ml of water, and titrate the excess alkali with 0.2 N hydrochloric acid to the disappearance of the pink colour. Record the volume, in ml of 0.2 N hydrochloric acid required as S.
Perform a blank titration on 25.0 ml of 0.45 N sodium hydroxide, and record the volume, in ml, of 0.2 N hydrochloric acid required as B.
where:
N = the exact normality of the hydrochloric acid solution
W = the weight of the sample in grams.
Vinyl acetate content
Headspace Gas Chromatographic method
Chromatographic system Use a gas chromatograph with 2 m x 2 mm (i.d.) glass column containing Porapak Q, 80-100 mesh (or equivalent) fitted with a flame ionisation detector, under the following conditions:
- air flow:
200 ml/min
- hydrogen flow:
30 ml/min
- nitrogen flow:
20 ml/min
- injection port temperature:
- column temperature:
- detector temperature:
Standard preparation:
Accurately weigh 150 mg vinyl acetate (reagent grade) into a 100 ml volumetric flask. Dissolve and make up to volume with distilled water. Place 1 ml of this solution in a 10-ml volumetric flask and make up to volume with distilled water. Add 1 ml of this dilute solution to 30 g unmodified starch of the same botanical origin as the test substance in a 100 ml flask with a septum-liner. Seal the flask immediately with the septum-liner. This provides a standard starch preparation with a vinyl acetate content of 5 mg/kg
Procedure:
Weigh 30 g of the test substance into a 100-ml flask with a septum-liner. Seal the flask. Place the flask containing the test substance and the flask containing the standard preparation in a constant temperature water bath at 70° for 30 min. Withdraw 2.0 ml from the headspace volume of the flask containing the standard preparation using a gas-tight syringe, inject directly into the injection port of the gas chromatograph and record the peak height of the chromatogram. Similarly inject 2.0 ml of the headspace volume from the flask containing the test substance into the chromatograph. Calculate the content of vinyl acetate in the test substance from a comparison of the peak hights of the two chromatograms.
Adipate group content
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1.
Reagents and Solutions:
- N,N-Bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA):
Macherey-Nagel, D 5160 Dueren, Germany or equivalent.
- Glutaric acid solution: Dissolve 1.00 g of glutaric acid (Merck or equivalent) in water and dilute to 1000 ml.
- Adipic acid solution: Dissolve 1.00 g of adipic acid (UCB, Brussels, Belgium or equivalent) in 900 ml of warm water, cool to room temperature, dilute to 1000 ml and mix.
Apparatus:
Chromatograph: Hewlett-Packard Model 7620A gas chromatograph or equivalent equipped with flame ionization detector and Model 3370A integrator.
Column parameters: 2-m stainless steel, 1.83 mm id, packed with 5% OV-17 on 80-100 mesh Chromosorb GAW-DMCS (Alltech Europe, Inc., B 9731 Eke, Belgium); precondition column 24 h at 350° with nitrogen carrier gas at 40 ml/min. Operating gas flow rates (ml/min): nitrogen carrier 30, hydrogen 40, air 400. Temperature: injection 280°, detector 250°, column 140°. Retention times (min): glutaric acid 2.83, adipic acid 4.50.
Calibration:
Weigh 1.0 g waxy corn starch into each of four 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. To each flask add 50 ml water and 1.0 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1.0 mg glutaric acid/ml. Add, to one flask, 0.25 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1.0 mg adipic acid per ml; to the other three, add 0.50 ml, 0.75 ml, and 1.0 ml, respectively. Each flask then contains 1.0 mg glutaric acid and, respectively, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 mg adipic acid. Agitate flasks manually to disperse the starch fully and add 50 ml 4N sodium hydroxide. Continue agitation another 5 min., place each flask in water bath at ambient temperature, and carefully add 20 ml 12 N hydrochloric acid to each. When each flask is cool quantitatively transfer contents to 250 ml separatory funnel. Extract with 100 ml reagent grade ethyl acetate. Drain bottom aqueous layer into beaker and collect upper organic layer in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 g anhydrous sodium sulphate. Transfer aqueous portion back to separatory
funnel and repeat ethyl acetate extraction twice more. Shake flasks periodically during 10 min and then filter contents through Whatman No. 1 paper into 1-litre round-bottom flasks. Rinse flasks and insoluble residues in filters twice with 50 ml of ethyl acetate. Under vacuum, (50 mm Hg) at temperature not exceeding 40°, evaporate total organic extraction and washings of each flask until completely dry.
The evaporation of ethyl acetate should be effected as quickly as possible because some hydrolysis takes place on standing. The products of hydrolysis cause a deterioration in the resolution of adipic acid in the chromatographic separation.
Successively add 2 ml pyridine and 1 ml N,N-bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide to the dry contents. Close round-bottom flasks with stopper and rinse internal surfaces thoroughly by swirling. Let flasks stand 1 h; then transfer ca 2 ml from each to small glass vials and immediately seal. Inject 4 m l into gas chromatograph.
Calculations:
Establish retention times for each acid and determine peak height for glutaric acid and for each level of adipic acid represented. A plot of peak height ratio of adipic acid to glutaric acid against amount of adipic acid is linear. This calibration curve may be used, but it is simpler to use a response factor (RF):
where:
H[S] and H[I] = peak heights of the standard adipic acid and glutaric acid, respectively; and W[S] = weight of the standard adipic acid.
RF should be verified weekly.
Total adipate content
Accurately weigh about 1.0 g of the sample into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, and add 50 ml water and 1.0 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1.0 mg glutaric acid/ml. Proceed as in Calibration, beginning "Agitate flasks manually...".
Free adipic acid content
Accurately weigh about 5.0 g of the sample into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 100 ml water and 1.0 ml of the glutaric acid solution. Agitate for 1 h, filter through a 0.45 m m Millipore filter, add 1 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid to the filtrate and transfer it quantitatively to a 250 ml separating runnel. Proceed as in Calibration, beginning "Extract with 100 ml..."
Calculation:
For both preparations ("Total adipate content" and "Free adipic acid content") record peak heights for adipic acid and glutaric acid (internal standard). Calculate the amounts of total adipate and free adipic acid, respectively, contained in the sample as follows:
where:
A = content of total adipate or free adipic acid respectively (%)
H[X] = peak height of adipic acid in the actual sample preparation
H[IX] = peak height of glutaric acid in the actual sample preparation
RF = response factor for adipic acid
S = weight of sample in the actual preparation (g)
Adipate groups (%) = Content of total adipate (%) - content of free adipic acid (%)
Hydroxypropyl group content
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1
Ninhydrin reagent: A 3% solution of 1,2,3,-triketohydrindene crystals in 5% aqueous sodium bisulfite solution.
Procedure:
Accurately weigh 50 - 100 mg of the sample into a 100-ml volumetric flask and add 25 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid. Prepare a sample of unmodified starch of the same source (i.e. corn or potato) in the same manner. Place the flasks in a boiling water bath and heat until the samples are in solution. Cool and dilute the contents to 100 ml with water. If necessary, dilute the sample further to assure the presence of no more than 4 mg of hydroxypropyl group per 100 ml, and then dilute the blank starch in the same proportion. Pipet 1 ml of the solutions into 25-ml graduated test tubes with glass stoppers and, with the tubes immersed in cold water, add dropwise 8 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to each. Mix well and place the tubes in a boiling water bath for exactly 3 min. Immediately transfer the tubes to an ice bath until the solution is chilled. Add 0.6 ml of ninhydrin reagent, carefully allowing the reagent to run down the walls of the test tubes. Immediately shake well, and place
the tubes in a 25° water bath for 100 min. Adjust the volume in each tube to 25 ml with concentrated sulfuric acid and mix by inverting the tubes several times. (Do not shake). Immediately transfer portions of the solutions to 1-cm cells designed for a Beckman Model B spectrophotometer, and after exactly 5 min, measure the absorption (A) at 590 nm, using the starch blank as the reference. Prepare a calibration curve with 1-ml aliquots of standard aqueous solutions, containing 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 m g of propylene glycol per ml.
Calculations:
where:
C = amount of propylene glycol in the sample solution read from the calibration curve (m g/ml)
F = dilution factor (if a further dilution has been necessary)
W = weight of sample (mg)
Propylene chlorohydrin
As specified in Column 3 of Table 1.
Apparatus
Gas Chromatograph
Use a Hewlett-Packard Model 5750 or equivalent. A dual-column instrument equipped with a flame-ionization detector is recommended. An integrator should be part of the recording system.
- Gas Chromatography column: Use a stainless steel column, 3 m x 3.2 mm (od), packed with 10% Carbowax 20 M on 80/100-mesh Gas Chrom 2, or equivalent. After packing and prior to use, condition the column overnight at 200°, using a helium flow of 25 ml per min.
- Concentrator: Use a Kuderna-Danish concentrator having a 500-ml flask, available from Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, N.J., USA, (Catalog No. K-57000), or equivalent.
- Pressure Bottles: Use 200 ml pressure bottles, with a Neoprene washer, glass stopper, and attached wire clamp, available from Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburg, PA, USA (Vitro 400, Catalog No. 3-100), or equivalent.
Reagents:
- Diethyl ether: Use anhydrous, analytical reagent-grade diethyl ether, (NOTE: Some lots of diethyl ether contain foreign residues that interfere with the analysis and/or the interpretation of the chromatograms. If the ether quality is unknown or suspect, concentrate 50 ml to a volume of about 1 ml in the Concentrator, and then chromatograph a 2.0-m l portion using the conditions outlined under the Procedure. If the chromatogram is excessively noisy and contains signal peaks that overlap or interfere in the measurement of the peaks produced by the propylene chlorohydrin isomers, the ether should be redistilled.)
- Florisil: Use 60/100 mesh material, available from Floridin Co., 3 Perm Center, Pittsburg, PA 15235, USA, or an equivalent product available from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA 16823, USA.
- Propylene chlorohydrins: Use Eastman No. P1325 1-Chloro-2-propanol Practical, containing 25% 2-chloro-1-propanol, available from Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y. 14650, USA.
- Standard preparation: Draw 25 m l of mixed propylene chlorohydrin isomers containing 75% of 1-chloro-2-propanol and 25% of 2-chloro-1-propanol) into a 50-m l syringe. Accurately weigh the syringe and discharge the contents into a 500-ml volumetric flask partially filled with water. Reweigh the syringe, and record the weight of the chlorohydrins taken. Dilute to the volume with water, and mix. This solution contains about 27.5 mg of mixed chlorohydrins, or about 55 m g per ml. Prepare this solution fresh on the day of use.
Sample Preparation:
Transfer a blended representative 50.0 g sample into a Pressure Bottle, and add 125 ml of 2 N sulfuric acid. Clamp the top in place, and swirl the contents until the sample is completely dispersed. Place the bottle in a boiling water bath, heat for 10 min, then swirl the bottle to mix the contents, and heat in the bath for an additional 15 min. Cool in air to room temperature, then neutralize the hydrolyzed sample to pH 7 with 25% sodium hydroxide solution, and filter through Whatman No. 1 paper, or equivalent, in a Buchner funnel, using suction. Wash the bottle and filter paper with 25 ml of water, and combine the washings with the filtrate. Add 30 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and stir with a magnetic stirring bar for 5 to 10 min, or until the sodium sulfate is completely dissolved. Transfer the solution into a 500-ml separator equipped with a teflon plug, rinse the flask with 25 ml of water, and combine the washings with the sample solution. Extract with five 50 ml
portions of diethyl ether, allowing at least 5 min in each extraction for adequate phase separation. Transfer the combined ether extracts in a Concentrator, place the graduated receiver of the concentrator in a water bath maintained at 50 - 55°, and concentrate the extract to a volume of 4 ml. (NOTE: Ether extracts of samples may contain foreign residues that interfere with the analysis and/or the interpretation of the chromatograms. These residues are believed to be degradation products arising during the hydrolysis treatment. Analytical problems created by their presence can be avoided through application of a clean-up treatment performed as follows:
Concentrate the ether extract to about 8 ml, instead of 4 ml specified above. Add 10 g of Florisil, previously heated to 130° for 16 h just before use, to a chromatographic tube of suitable size, then tap gently, and add 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top of the column. Wet the column with 25 ml of diethyl ether, and quantitatively transfer the concentrated extract to the column with the aid of small portions of the ether. Elute with three 25-ml portions of the ether, collect all of the eluate, transfer it to a concentrator, and concentrate to a volume of 4 ml). Cool the extract to room temperature, transfer it quantitatively to a 5.0-ml volumetric flask with the aid of small portions of diethyl ether, dilute to volume with the ether, and mix.
Control Preparations:
Transfer 50.0 g portions of unmodified (underivatized) waxy corn starch into five separate pressure bottles, and add 125 ml of 2 N sulfuric acid to each bottle. Add 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 ml of the Standard Preparation to the bottles, respectively, giving propylene chlorohydrin concentrations, on the starch basis, of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively. Calculate the exact concentration in each bottle from the weight of propylene chlorohydrins used in making the Standard Preparation. Clamp the tops in place, swirl until the contents of each bottle are completely dissolved, and proceed with the hydrolysis, neutralization, filtration, extraction, extract concentration, and final dilution as directed under Sample Preparation.
Procedure:
The operating conditions may be varied, depending upon the particular instrument used, but a suitable chromatogram is obtained with the Hewlett-Packard Model 5750 using a column oven temperature of 110°, isothermal; injection port temperature of 210°; detector temperature of 240°; and hydrogen (30 ml per min), helium (25 ml per min), or air (350 ml per min) as the carrier gas. A 1.0 mV full-scale recorder is recommended; range, attenuation, and chart speed should be selected to optimize signal characteristics. Inject 2.0 m l aliquots of each of the concentrated extracts, prepared as directed under Control Preparation, allowing sufficient time between injections for signal peaks corresponding to the two chlorohydrin isomers to be recorded (and integrated) and for the column to be purged. Record and sum the signal areas (integrator outputs) from the two chlorohydrin isomers for each of the controls. Using identical operating conditions, inject a 2.0-m l aliquot of the
concentrated extract prepared as directed under Sample Preparation, and record and sum the signal areas (integrator outputs) from the sample.
Calculation:
Prepare a calibration plot on linear coordinate graph paper by plotting the summed signal areas for each of the controls against the calculated propylene chlorohydrin concentrations, in mg/kg, derived from the actual weight of chlorohydrin isomers used. Using the summed signal areas corresponding to the 1-chloro-2-propanol and 2-chloro-1-propanol from the sample, determine the concentration of mixed propylene chlorohydrins, in mg/kg, in the sample by reference to the calibration plot derived from the control samples. After gaining experience with the procedure and demonstrating that the calibration plot derived from the control samples is linear and reproducible, the number of controls can be reduced to one containing about 5 mg/kg of mixed propylene chlorohydrin isomers. The propylene chlorohydrin level in the sample can then be calculated as follows:
in which C is the concentration, in mg/kg, of propylene chlorohydrins (sum of isomers) in the control; a is the sum of signal areas produced by the propylene chlorohydrin isomers in the sample; and A is the sum of the signal areas produced by the propylene chlorohydrin isomers in the control.
Degree of substitution of starch sodium octenyl succinate
Principle:
The Degree of Substitution is determined by alkali consumed after acidification and thorough washing of the starch half ester.
Procedure:
Weigh out 5.0 g of sample in a 150-ml beaker. Wet out with a few ml of reagent grade isopropyl alcohol. Add, by pipette 25 ml of 2.5 N hydrochloric acid in isopropanol, allowing the acid to wash down any sample on the sides of the beaker. Stir for 30 min on a magnetic stir plate. Add 100 ml of 90% isopropanol from a graduated cylinder. Stir for 10 min. Filter the sample through a Buchner funnel and wash the filter cake with 90% isopropanol until the filtrate is negative for chloride ions. Use 0.1 N AgNO[3] to check for chloride ions. Transfer the filter cake to a 600-ml beaker and rinse the Buchner funnel to wash any starch into the beaker. Bring to a 300-ml volume with distilled water. Place for 10 min in a boiling water bath with stirring. Titrate while hot with 0.1 N NaOH to the phenolphthalein end-point.
Calculation:
Calculate as follows:
where:
A = milliequivalents of sodium hydroxide required per g of starch octenyl succinate.
Residual octenyl succinic acid in starch sodium octenyl succinate
Extraction and Preparation of Sample Solution:
Extract about 500 mg of starch with 15 ml of methanol overnight under constant shaking (weigh starch accurately). Filter the extraction mixture. Wash the starch on the filter with 7 ml of methanol. Repeat three times. Combine all filtrates (about 80% of the residuals are extracted by this procedure). Add 1 ml of 0.16 N methanolic KOH to the extracts. Dry the extracts with a flash evaporator at 30°. Dissolve the residue in 2 ml methanol. Take 0.5 ml of residue solution to the reaction vial. Add 0.5 ml derivative reagent (2.8 g of 2-p-dibromoacetophenone and 0.28 g 18-Crown-6 in 50 ml CH[3]CN) to the reaction vial. Add 2 ml CH[3]CN to the reaction vial. Cap the reaction vial and heat it at 80° for 30 min. Cool the reaction solution to room temperature (use within 24h).

Plot peak height from Liquid Chromatograph Chart versus m g of residuals per 5 ml of solution.
Calculations:
Prepare a calibration curve according to the procedure. Using the peak height of the unknown sample from the Liquid Cromato-graph Chart, determine the level of residuals (calculated as octenyl succinic acid) in the injected volume from the calibration curve.
Note: The formula is corrected to 100% recovery by dividing by 0.80, so that 240/0.80 = 300.

Residue on ignition
Accurately weigh about 4 g of the sample in a tared porcelain or platinum dish and heat over a flame. The sample volatiles without emitting any acrid odour. Ignite not to exceed very dull redness, until free from carbon. Cool in a desiccator and weigh.
Colour
Melt about 10 g of the sample on a steam bath, and pour about 5 ml of the liquid into a 150 x 16-mm clear-glass bacteriological test tube, keeping the sample melted. The petrolatum is not darker than a solution made by mixing 3.8 ml of ferric chloride TS and 1.2 ml of cobaltous chloride TS in a similar tube, the comparison of the two being made in reflected light against a white background, holding the sample tube directly against the background at such an angle that there is no fluorescence.
Acidity or alkalinity
Introduce 35 g of the sample into a 250-ml separator, add 100 ml of boiling water, and shake vigorously for 5 min. After the petrolatum and water have separated, draw of the water into a casserole, wash the sample in the separator with two 50-ml portions of boiling water, and add the washings to the casserole. To the accumulated 200 ml of water add 1 drop of phenolphthalein TS and boil. The solution does not acquire a pink colour. If the addition of phenolphthalein produces no pink colour, add 0.1 ml of methyl orange TS. No red pink colour is produced.
Sulfur
Use the method as described in ASTM D 2622
Organic acids
Weigh 20 g of the sample, add 50 ml of neutralized ethanol, and 50 ml of water, agitate throughly, and heat to boiling. Add 1 ml phenolphthalein TS, and titrate rapidly with 0.1M sodium hydroxide, with vigorous agitation to a sharp pink end-point, noting the colour change in the alcohol - water layer. Not more than 0.4 ml is required.
Fixed oils, fats and rosins
Digest 10 g of the sample at 100° with 10 g of sodium hydroxide and 50 ml of water for 30 min. Separate the water layer, and add to it an excess of diluted sulfuric acid TS. No oily or solid matter separates.

General Instructions
Because of the sensitivity of the test, the possibility of errors arising from contamination is great. It is of the greatest importance that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware, including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is a recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints. Great care to avoid contamination of wax samples in handling and to assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons sought in this test are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be carried out under subdued light.

(Overall length of the column with the female joint is 235 mm). The female 24/40 standard tapered fitting at the opposite end.
- Disc: Tetrafluoroethylene polymer 2-inch diameter disc approximately 3/16-inch thick with a hole bored in the center to closely fit the stem of the chromatographic tube.
- Heating jacket: Conical, for 500-ml separatory funnel. (Used with variable transformer heat control).
- Suction flask: 250-ml or 500-ml filter flask.
- Condenser: 24/40 joints, fitted with a drying tube, length optional.
- Evaporation flask (optional): 250-ml or 500-ml capacity all-glass flask equipped with standard taper stopper having inlet and outlet tubes permitting passage of nitrogen across the surface of the liquid to be evaporated.
- Vacuum distillation assembly: All glass (for purification of dimethyl sulfoxide); 2 litre distillation flask with heating mantle; Vigreaux vacuum-jacketed condenser (or equivalent) about 45 cm in length and distilling head with separable cold finger condenser. Use of tetrafluoroethylene polymer sleeves on the glass joints will prevent freezing. Do not use grease on stopcocks or joints.

Reagents and materials
- Organic solvents: All solvents used throughout the procedure shall meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The isooctane, benzene, acetone, and methyl alcohol designated in the list following this paragraph shall pass the following test:
To the specified quantity of solvent in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 ml of purified n-hexadecane and evaporate on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a loose aluminium foil jacket around the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 ml of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene add a 10 ml portion of purified isooctane, re-evaporate, and repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene).
Alternatively, the evaporation time can be reduced by using the optional evaporation flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane are placed in the flask on the steam bath, the tube assembly is inserted, and a stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet tube while the outlet tube is connected to a solvent trap and vacuum line in such a way as to prevent any flow-back of condensate into the flask.
Dissolve the 1 ml of hexadecane residue in isooctane and make to 25 ml volume. Determine the absorbance in the 5 cm path length cells compared to isooactane as reference. The absorbance of the solution of the solvent residue (except for methyl alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per cm path length between 280 and 400 nm. For methyl alcohol this absorbance value shall be 0.00.
- Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane): Use 180 ml for the test described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by passage through a column of activated silica gel, Grade 12, Davidson Chemical Company, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, or equivalent, about 90 cm in length and 5 cm to 8 cm in diameter.
- Benzene, reagent grade: Use 150 ml for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.
- Acetone, reagent grade: Use 200 ml for the test. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.
- Eluting mixtures:
1. 10% benzene in isooctane: Pipet 50 ml of benzene into a 500-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask and adjust to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
2. 20% benzene in isooctane: Pipet 50 ml of benzene into a 250-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and adjust to volume with isooctane, with mixing.
3. Acetone-benzene-water mixture: Add 20 ml of water to 380 ml of acetone and 200 ml of benzene, and mix.
- n-Hexadecane, 99% olefin-free: Dilute 1.0 ml of n-hexadecane to 25 ml with isooctane and determine the absorbance in a 5-cm cell compared to isooctane as reference point between 280-400 nm. The absorbance per centimeter path length shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. Purify, if necessary, by percolation through activated silica gel or by distillation.
- Methyl alcohol, reagent grade: Use 10.0 ml of methyl alcohol. Purify, if necessary, by distillation.
- Dimethyl sulfoxide: Pure grade, clear, water-white, m.p. 180 minimum. Dilute 120 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240 ml of distilled water in a 500-ml separatory funnel, mix and allow to cool for 5-10 min. Add 40 ml of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the runnel vigourously for 2 min. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-ml separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 ml of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 40 ml extracts three times with 50 ml portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extract through anhydrous sodium sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter), into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 40 ml isooctane extract, and pass through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Then wash the
second and first separatory funnels successively with a 10 ml portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1-ml of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-ml portion of isooctane and re-evaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane. Again, add 10 ml of isooctane to the residue and evaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane to insure complete removal of all volatile materials. Dissolve the 1 ml of hexadecane in isooctane and make to 25 ml volume. Determine the absorbance in 5 cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference. The absorbance of the solution should not exceed 0.02 per cm path length in the 280-400 nm range. (Note Difficulty in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic impurities in the distilled water. Repetition of the test omitting the dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If
necessary to meet the specification, purify the water by redistillation, passage through an ion-exchange resin, or otherwise).
Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1.5 litres of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-litre glass-stoppered flask, add 6.0 ml of phosphoric acid and 50 g of Norit A (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoro-ethylene polymer coated bar) stir the solvent for 15 min. Filter the dimethyl sulfoxide through four thicknesses of fluted paper (18.5 cm), Schleicher & Schuell No. 597, or equivalent. If the initial filtrate contains carbon fines, refilter through the same filter until a clear filtrate is obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air and moisture during this operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection flask with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the filtrate to a 2-litre separatory funnel and draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2-litre distillation flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately 3-mm Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-ml
fraction of the distillate and replace the distillate collection flask with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 litre of the sulfoxide has been collected.
At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will react with some metal containers in the presence of air.
- Phosphoric acid, 85% reagent grade
- Sodium borohydride, 98%
- Magnesium oxide (Sea Sorb 43, Food Machinery Company, Westvaco Division, distributed by chemical supplier firms, or equivalent): Place 100 g of the magnesium oxide in a large beaker, add 700 ml of distilled water to make a thin slurry, and heat on a steam bath for 30 min with intermittent stirring. Stir well initially to insure that all the absorbent is completely wetted. Using a Buchner funnel and a filter paper of suitable diameter, filter with suction. Continue suction until water no longer drips from the funnel. Transfer the absorbent to a glass trough lined with aluminium foil (free from rolling oil). Break up the magnesia with a clean spatula and spread out the absorbent on the aluminium foil in a layer about 1-2 cm thick. Dry at 160±1° for 24h. Pulverize the magnesia with mortar and pestle. Sieve the pulverized absorbent between 60-180 mesh. Use the magnesia retained on the 180-mesh sieve.
- Celite 545, Johns-Manville Company, diatomaceous earth, or equivalent.
- Magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture (2+1) by weight: Place the magnesium oxide (60-180 mesh) and the Celite 545 in 2 to 1 proportions, respectively, by weight in a glass-stoppered flask large enough for adequate mixing. Shake vigorously for 10 min. Transfer the mixture to a glass trough lined with aluminium foil (free from rolling oil) and spread it out on a layer about 1 to 2 cm thick. Reheat the mixture at 160 ± 1° for 2 h, and store in a tightly closed flask.
- Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, reagent grade, preferably in granular form: For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters required in the method: Place approximately 35 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a 30 ml coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65 ml filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15 ml portions of the indicated solvent until a 15 ml portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per cm path length between 280 nm and 400 nm when tested as prescribed under "Organic solvents." Usually three portions of wash solvent are sufficient.
Procedure
Before proceeding with the analysis of a sample, determine the absorbance in a 5 cm path cell between 250 nm and 400 nm for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without a wax sample, at room temperature, recording the spectra after the extraction stage and after the complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter path length following the extraction stage should not exceed 0.040 in the wavelength range from 250 to 400 nm; the absorbance per cm path length following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.070 in the wavelength range from 250 to 299 nm, inclusive, nor 0.045 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 400 nm. If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250-260 nm region are present, remove the benzene by the procedure under "Organic solvents" and record absorbance again.
Place 300 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-litre separatory funnel and add 75 ml of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the runnel and allow to stand for 10 min. (The reaction between the sulfoxide and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep funnel stoppered). Add 150 ml of isooctane and shake to pre-equilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in glass-stoppered flasks.
Place a representative 1-kg sample of wax, or if this amount is not available, the entire sample, in a beaker of a capacity about three times the volume of the sample and heat with occasional stirring on a steam bath until the wax is completely melted and homogenous. Weigh four 25 ± 0.2 g portions of the melted wax in separate 100 ml beakers. Reserve three of the portions for later replicate analyses as necessary. Pour one weighed portion immediately after remelting (on the steam bath) into a 500 ml separatory funnel containing 100 ml of the pre-equilibrated sulfoxide-phosphoric acid mixture that has been heated in the heating jacket at a temperature just high enough to keep the wax melted. (Note: In pre-heating the sulfoxide-acid mixture, remove the stopper of the separatory funnel at intervals to release the pressure).
Promptly complete the transfer of the sample to the funnel in the jacket with portions of the pre-equilibrated isooctane, warming the beaker, if necessary, and using a total volume of just 50 ml of the solvent. If the wax comes out of solution during these operations, let the stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves. (Remove stopper from the funnel at intervals to release pressure).
When the wax is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it vigorously for 2 min. Set up three 250-ml separatory funnels with each containing 30 ml of pre-equilibrated isooctane. After separation of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the main portion of the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl the funnel when precipitation first occurs on the inside surface of the funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw off the lower layer, filter it slowly through a thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a filter funnel into the first 250-ml separatory funnel, and wash in tandem with the 30-ml portions of isooctane contained in the 250-ml separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after each extraction to keep the wax in solution and washing each extractive in tandem through the same three
portions of isooctane.
Collect the successive extracts (300 ml total) in a separatory funnel (preferably 2-litre), containing 480 ml of distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last extract has been added. Add 80 ml of isooctane to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 min. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel (preferably 2-litre) and repeat the extraction with 80 ml of isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80 ml extracts three times with 100-ml portions of distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 min. Discard the aqueous layers. Filter the first extract through anhydrous sodium sulfate pre-washed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter) into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the first separatory funnel with the second 80 ml isooctane extract and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash
the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 20-ml portion of isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1 ml of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-ml portions of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 ml of hexadecane, and repeat this operation once more.
Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-ml volumetric flask, make to volume, and mix. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5-cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 280-400 nm (take care to lose none of the solution in filling the sample cell). Correct the absorbance values for any absorbance derived from reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in the Characteristics, the wax meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications. If the corrected absorbance per centimeter path length exceeds the limits prescribed in the Characteristics, proceed as follows:
Quantitatively transfer the isooctane solution to a 125-ml flask equipped with 24/40 joint and evaporate the isooctane on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 1 ml of hexadecane. Add 10 ml of methyl alcohol and approximately 0.3 g of sodium borohydride (Minimize exposure of the borohydride to the atmosphere. A measuring dipper may be used). Immediately fit a water-cooled condenser equipped with a 24/40 joint and with a drying tube into the flask, mix until the borohydride is dissolved, and allow to stand for 30 min at room temperature, with intermittent swirling. At the end of this period, disconnect the flask and evaporate the methyl alcohol on the steam bath under nitrogen until the sodium borohydride begins to come out of the solution. Then add 10 ml of isooctane and evaporate to a volume of about 2-3 ml. Again, add 10 ml of isooctane and concentrate to a volume of approximately 5 ml. Swirl the flask repeatedly to assure adequate washing of the sodium
borohydride residues.
Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem of the chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction flask and apply the vaccum (approximately 135-mm Hg pressure). Weigh out 14 g of the 2+1 magnesium oxide-Celite 545 mixture and pour the adsorbent mixture into the chromatographic tube in approximately 3 cm layers. After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few ml of each adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 14 g of the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 12.5 cm in depth. Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Fit the 500-ml reservoir onto
the top of the chromatographic column and pre-wet the column by passing 100 ml of isooctane through the column. Adjust the nitrogen pressure so that the rate of descent of the isooctane coming off of the column is between 2-3 ml per min. Discontinue pressure just before the last of the isooctane reaches the level of the adsorbent. (Caution: Do not allow the liquid level to recede below the adsorbent level at any time). Remove the reservoir and decant the 5 ml isooctane concentrate solution onto the column and with slight pressure again allow the liquid level to recede to barely above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with two 5 ml portions of isooctane, swirling the flask repeatedly each time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Just before the final 5 ml wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 100 ml of isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the 2-3 ml per minute rate. Just before the last of the isooctane reaches the
adsorbent level, add 100 ml of 10% benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at the aforementioned rate. Just before the solvent mixture reaches adsorbent level, add 25 ml of 20% benzene in isooctane to the reservoir and continue the percolation at 2-3 ml per minute until all this solvent mixture has been removed from the column. Discard all the elution solvents collected up to this point. Add 300 ml of the acetone-benzene-water mixture to the reservoir and percolate through the column to elute the polynuclear compounds. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-litre separatory funnel. Allow the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Wash the eluate three times with 300-ml portions of distilled water, shaking well for each wash. (The addition of small amounts of sodium chloride facilitates separation). Discard the aqueous layer after each wash. After the final separation, filter the residual benzene through anhydrous sodium sulfate
pre-washed with benzene (see Sodium sulfate under "Reagents and Materials" for preparation of filter) into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the separatory runnel with two additional 20-ml portions of benzene which are also filtered through the sodium sulfate. Add 1 ml of n-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate benzene as previously described under "Organic Solvents". Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25 ml volumetric flask and adjust the volume. Determine the absorbance of the solution in the 5 cm path length cells compared to isooctane as reference between 250 - 400 nm. Correct for any absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the procedure without a wax sample. If either spectrum shows the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 - 260 nm region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under
"Organic Solvents". Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25 ml volumetric flask. Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed the limits prescribed in the Characteristics the substance meets the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.

IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Precipitate formation with calcium chloride
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-fifth of its volume of a 2.5% solution of calcium chloride. A voluminous, gelatinous precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes potassium alginate from gum arabic, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, gelatin, gum ghatti, karaya gum, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and tragacanth gum.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulphate
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-half of its volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. No precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes potassium alginate from agar, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, de-esterified pectin, gelatin, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and starch.
Test for alginate
Moisten 1-5 mg of the sample with water and add 1 ml of acid ferric sulfate TS. Within 5 min, a cherry-red colour develops that finally becomes deep purple.
Water-insoluble matter
Disperse 2 g of the sample, weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg, in 800 ml of water in a 2,000-ml flask. Neutralize to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide TS and then add 3 ml in excess. Add 40 ml of hydrogen peroxide solution containing 30% by weight H[2]O[2], cover the flask and boil for 1 h with frequent stirring. Filter while hot through a tared Gooch crucible provided with a glass fibre filter (2.4 cm, No. 934 AH, Reeve Angel & Co., Clifton, N.Y., or equivalent filter). If slow filtration is caused by high viscosity of the sample solution, boil until the viscosity is reduced enough to permit filtration. Wash the crucible thoroughly with hot water, dry the crucible and its contents at 105° for 1 h, cool and weigh. Calculate as percentage of the dry weight.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 29.75 mg of potassium alginate (equivalent weight 238).

Weigh 5 g of the sample to the nearest mg, transfer into a 100-ml beaker and add 50 ml of water. Stir until all the sample appears to be completely dissolved. Filter through a Gooch crucible, tared to an accuracy of ± 0.2 mg. Rinse the beaker with 20 ml of water. Dry the crucible with its contents in a 60° oven to constant weight. Cool in a desiccator, weigh, and calculate as percentage.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Weigh, to the nearest mg, 3 g of the sample previously dried at 105° for 2 h into a distillation flask and add 200 ml of 50% phosphoric acid. Boil for 2 h and collect the distillate. During distillation keep the volume in the flask at about 200 ml by adding water using dropping funnel. Titrate the distillate with IN sodium hydroxide using phenolphthalein TS as indicator. Each ml of IN sodium hydroxide corresponds to 112.17 mg of C[3]H[5]KO[2].

Propylene glycol esters of fatty acids
Prepared at the 49th JECFA (1997) superseding specifications prepared at the 46th JECFA (1996), published in FNP 52 Addendum 4 (1996)
SYNONYMS
Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids, INS No. 477
DEFINITION
Propylene glycol esters of fatty acids are mixtures of propylene glycol mono- and diesters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids derived from edible oils and fats. The products are produced either by direct esterification of propylene glycol with fatty acids or by transesterification of propylene glycol with oils or fats. When prepared by transesterification, the product may contain residual mono- and diglycerides and glycerol. The process may be followed by molecular distillation to separate the monoesters.

Soap
Prepare a solvent mixture consisting of equal parts, by volume, of toluene and methanol, add bromophenol blue TS, and neutralize with 0.5N hydrochloric acid, or use neutralized acetone as the solvent. Weigh accurately about 5 g of the sample, dissolve it in 100 ml of the neutralized solvent mixture, and titrate with 0.5N hydrochloric acid to a definite yellow endpoint. Calculate the percentage of soap in the sample by the formula:
in which V and N are the volume and normality, respectively, of the hydrochloric acid, W is the weight of the sample, in g, and e is the equivalence factor, e = 31.0.
Free propylene glycol
Reagents and Solutions:
Periodic Acid solution: Dissolve 5.4 g of periodic acid, H[5]IO[6] in 100 ml of water, add 1900 ml of glacial acetic acid, and mix. Store in a light-resistant, glass-stoppered bottle or in a clear, glass-stoppered bottle protected from light.
Chloroform: Use chloroform meeting the following test: To each of three 500-ml flasks add 50.0 ml of Periodic Acid Solution, then add 50 ml of chloroform and 10 ml of water to two of the flasks and 50 ml of water to the third. To each flask add 20 ml of potassium iodide TS, mix gently, and allow to stand at least 1 min, but no longer than 5 min, before titrating. Add 100 ml of water, and titrate with 0.1N sodium thiosulfate, using a magnetic stirrer to keep the solution thoroughly mixed, to the disappearance of the brown iodine color, then add 2 ml of starch TS and continue the titration to the disappearance of the blue color. The difference between the volume of 0.1N sodium thiosulfate required in the titrations with and without the chloroform is not greater than 0.5 ml.
Procedure:
Melt the sample, if not liquid, at a temperature not higher than 100° above its melting point, and mix thoroughly. Transfer an accurately weighed portion of the sample, equivalent to about 30 mg of propylene glycol into a 100 ml beaker, and dissolve in 25 ml of chloroform. Transfer the solution with the aid of an additional 25 ml of chloroform, into a separator, wash the beaker with 25 ml of water, and add the washing to the separator. Stopper the separator tightly, shake vigorously for 30 to 60 sec, and allow the layers to separate. (Add 1 to 2 ml of glacial acetic acid to break emulsions formed due to the presence of soap.) Collect the aqueous layer in a 500-ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, and extract the chloroform solution again using two 25-ml portions of water. To the combined aqueous extracts add 50.0 ml of Periodic Acid Solution. Run two blanks by adding 50.0 ml of this reagent solution to two 500 ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 75 ml of
water and allow to stand for at least 30 min, but no longer than 90 min. To each flask, add 20 ml of potassium iodide TS, and allow to stand at least 1 min, but no longer than 5 min, before titrating. Add 100 ml of water, and titrate with 0.1N sodium thiosulfate, using a magnetic stirrer to keep the solution thoroughly mixed, to the disappearance of the brown iodine color, then add 2 ml of starch TS and continue the titration to the disappearance of the blue color.
Calculation:
Calculate the percentage of free propylene glycol by the formula:
in which b is the number of ml of sodium thiosulfate consumed in the blank determination; S is the number of ml required in the titration of the aqueous extracts from the sample; N is the exact normality of the sodium thiosulfate; W is the weight, in g, of the original sample taken and 3.81 is the molecular weight of propylene glycol divided by 20.
Note: If the aqueous extract contains more than 30 mg of propylene glycol, dilute the extract in a volumetric flask and transfer a suitable aliquot into a 500 ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask before proceeding with the test. The weight of the sample should be corrected in the calculation.
Total propylene glycol and glycerol
A. Sample preparation
Transfer about 15 g of sample, accurately weighed, into a 500-ml flask, add 250 ml of ethanol and 7.5 g of potassium hydroxide and mix. Reflux the solution for 2 h, transfer into an 800-ml beaker rinsing the flask with about 100 ml of water and adding the rinse water to the beaker. Heat on a steam or water bath, adding water occasionally to replace the ethanol and evaporate until the odour of ethanol can no longer be detected. Adjust the volume to about 250 ml with hot water, neutralize with diluted sulfuric acid (1 in 2), add a slight excess of acid, heat with gentle stirring until the fatty acid layer separates. Transfer the fatty acids into a warm 500-ml separatory funnel, wash with four 20-ml portions of hot water and combine the washings with the original aqueous layer from the saponification. Extract the combined aqueous layer with three 20 ml portions of petroleum ether. Neutralize the aqueous layer with sodium hydroxide TS to pH 7. Transfer the solution to a 500-ml
volumetric flask and dilute to the mark with water.
B. Total Propylene glycol
Pipette 5.0 ml of the solution into a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 5.0 ml of 1M periodic acid, swirl and let stand 15 min. Add 10 ml of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, followed by 15.0 ml of 0. IN sodium arsenite and 1 ml of potassium iodide solution (1 in 20) and mix. Add enough sodium bicarbonate so that at the end point some remains undissolved, and titrate with 0.1N iodine, using a 10-ml microburette and continuing the titration to a faint yellow colour. Perform a blank determination and make the appropriate corrections. Each ml of 0.1N iodine is equivalent to 3.805 mg of propylene glycol.
If the qualitative test for glycerol included under Identification Test (Positive test for propylene glycol) showed the product to contain glycerol, it becomes necessary to correct for the glycerol content of the polyol solution obtained after saponification and separation of liberated fatty acids.
C. Glycerol
Pipette 50 ml of the solution prepared in "A. Sample preparation" into a 600-ml beaker, add bromothymol blue TS and acidify with 0.2N sulfuric acid to a definite greenish-yellow colour. Neutralize with 0.05N sodium hydroxide to a definite blue end point free of green colour. Prepare a blank containing 50 ml of water and neutralize in the same manner. Pipette 50 ml of sodium periodate TS into each beaker, mix by swirling, cover with a watch glass and allow to stand for 30 min at room temperature (not above 35°) in the dark or in subdued light. Add 10 ml of a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene glycol and water and allow to stand 20 min. Dilute each solution to about 300 ml and titrate with 0.1N sodium hydroxide to pH 8.1±0.1 using a calibrated pH meter. Each ml of 0.1N sodium hydroxide, after correction for the blank, is equivalent to 9.210 mg of glycerol.
The true propylene glycol content (in g/100 g of esters) is equal to the apparent propylene glycol content (in g/100 g of esters) minus 1.65 x the glycerol content (in g/100 g of esters).
METHOD OF ASSAY
Determine by gas chromatography using the following: Gas chromatograph, with split injection or on-column injection, oven temperature programming and flame ionisation detector. For split injection an injection port with programmable temperature is preferable. For on-column injection, the reaction mixture is diluted 1:50 with pyridine prior to injection.
Column: Fused silica capillary column, surface fully deactivated by silylation agent, 12-25 m, 0.25-0.35 mm i.d., coating 95% methyl- 5% phenyl silicone (or other phase with similar polarity), film thickness 0.1-0.2 m n.
Injection: Volume 1-5 m l: split injection (Split ratio 1:10-1:50); direct injection (hold for 1 min)
Temperatures: Injection port 320° (or 60° for on-column injection); column initial 50° (or 60° for on-column injection); programme rate 10°/min; final temperature 350°, hold 1 min; detector 400°; carrier gas flow 2-5 ml He/min (at 80°)
N.B. The precise temperature conditions will be dependent on the details of the equipment used.
Reagents:
N,N - bis(trimethylsilyl)fluoroacetamide (BSTFA)
Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS)
Pyridine, analytical grade, kept over KOH
n-Heptadecane, analytical grade, 99% minimum
Reference materials: Propylene glycol, propylene glycol monostearate.
Internal standard solution: Accurately weigh approximately 100 mg internal standard, n-heptadecane into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute with pyridine to the mark.
Reference solution: Accurately weigh approximately 100 mg propylene glycol monostearate into a 25-ml volumetric flask adding internal standard solution to the mark. When pure reference material of other components such as propylene glycol and di-fatty acid esters of propylene glycol are available, the method is suitable for these also.
Procedure:
Accurately weigh approximately 100 mg of the homogenised sample into a 25-ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with the internal standard solution. Transfer 0.8 ml of the sample solution to a 2.5-ml screw cap vial with Teflon faced septa or 2.0-ml vial for auto sampler. Add 0.3 ml BSTFA and 0.1 ml TMCS. Close the vial and shake vigorously. Heat the reaction mixture in a heating device at 70° for approximately 20 min, inject 1 to 5 m l of the reaction mixture into the gas chromatograph showing a stable baseline. Do not delay GC analysis. Repeat the reaction with a further 100 mg sample. Make two injections per reaction sample. Transfer 0.8 ml of reference solution to a vial and add the silylating agents, 0.3 ml BSTFA and 0.1 ml TMCS. Heat the reaction mixture and inject into the gas chromatograph as described above.
Identification:
Analyse reference solution using the same operating conditions as for the sample solution. Identify peaks by comparison of retention time with known substances or apply coupled GC/MS.
Calculation and expression of results:
Calculate response factor R[X] of the reference substance X vs. internal standard using the reference solution chromatogram. The value of the response factor is given by the formula:
R[X] = (m[is]/m[X]) x (A[X]/A[is])
where:
m[is] = mass of internal standard in mg
m[X] = mass of reference substance X in mg
A[X] = peak area of reference substance X
A[is] = peak area of internal standard
Calculate percentage of mass content m'[X] of component X in the sample by the formula:
m'[X] ^= 1/R[X] x (m'[is]/m'[s]) x (A'[X]/A'[is])%
where:
m'[is] = mass of internal standard in sample in mg
m'[s] = mass of sample in mg
A'[X] = peak area of component X in the sample
A'[is] = peak area of internal standard in sample
When calculating the total content of propylene glycol monoesters in the sample the response factor of propylene monostearate is used for all propylene glycol monoesters in the sample. The FID response of propylene glycol monostearate does not differ significantly from that of other fatty acid monoesters of propylene glycol.

Lead
I. Principle:
Determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. (Food Chemicals Codex, 4th Ed. (1996), National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, pp. 765-766)
II. Apparatus:
An atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Model 3100 or equivalent) fitted with a graphite furnace (Perkin-Elmer HGA 600 or equivalent), a lead hollow cathode lamp (Perkin-Elmer or equivalent) with argon as the carrier gas.
Follow the manufacturer's directions for setting the appropriate instrument parameters for lead determination. (NOTE: Use reagent-grade chemicals with as low a lead content as practicable, as well as high-purity water and gases.) Prior to this analysis, rinse all glassware and plasticware twice with 10% nitric acid and twice with 10% hydrochloric acid. Then rinse thoroughly with high-purity water, preferably obtained from a mixed-bed strong acid/strong base ion-exchange cartridge capable of producing water with an electrical resistivity of 12 to 15 megohms.
III. Solutions:
Hydrogen Peroxide-Nitric Acid Solution: Mix together equal volumes of 10% hydrogen peroxide and 10% nitric acid (NOTE: use extreme caution; gloves and protective eyeware).
Butanol-Nitric Acid Solution: Introduce approximately 500 ml of n-butanol in a 1000-ml volumetric flask. Slowly add 50 ml nitric acid. Dilute to volume with n-butanol and mix.
Lead Nitrate Stock Solution: Using glassware that is free of lead salts, dissolve 159.8 mg of reagent-grade lead nitrate in 100 ml of Hydrogen Peroxide-Nitric Acid Solution. Dilute to 1000.0 ml with Hydrogen Peroxide-Nitric Acid Solution and mix. Each ml of this solution contains the equivalent of 100 m g of lead ion.
Standard Lead Solution. On the day of use, pipet 10.0 ml of Lead Nitrate Stock Solution into a 100.0 ml volumetric flask, add Hydrogen Peroxide-Nitric Acid Solution to the mark and mix. Each ml of Standard Lead Solution contains the equivalent of 10 m g of lead ion.
Standard Solutions. Into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks, pipet 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 ml, respectively, of Standard Lead Solution; dilute to volume with Butanol-Nitric Acid Solution. These solutions contain 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 m g lead per ml, respectively.
Sample Solution. (NOTE: Perform this procedure in a fame hood). Accurately weigh 1 g of the sample, and transfer to a large test tube. Add 1 ml of nitric acid. Place the test tube in a rack in a boiling water bath. As soon as the rusty tint (reddish-brown colour) is gone, add 1 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide dropwise (in order to avoid a vigorous reaction) and wait for bubbles to form. Stir with an acid-washed plastic spatula if necessary. Remove the test tube from the water bath and let it cool. Transfer the solution to a 10-ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with Butanol-Nitric Acid Solution. Use this solution for analysis.
Tungsten Solution. Transfer 0.1 g of tungstic acid (H[2]WO[4]) and 5 g of sodium hydroxide pellets into a 50-ml plastic bottle. Add 5.0 ml of high-purity water (distilled water may be redistilled from an all-glass apparatus or may be passed down a column of cation exchange resin, e.g., Amberlite IR 120(H)), and mix. Heat the mixture in a hot water bath until completely dissolved. Cool, and store at room temperature.
IV. Procedure:
Place the graphite tube in the furnace. Inject a 20-m l aliquot of Tungsten Solution into the graphite tube, using a 300-ml/min argon flow and the following sequence of conditions: dry at 110° for 20 sec, char at 700° to 900° for 20 sec, and, with the argon flow stopped, atomize at 2700° for 10 sec; repeat again using a second 20-m l aliquot. Clean the quartz windows.
(NOTE: The sample injection technique is the most crucial step in controlling the precision of the analysis; the volume of the sample must remain constant. Rinse the m l pipet tip (Eppendorf or equivalent) three times with either the Standard Solutions or Sample Solution before injection. Use a fresh pipet tip for each injection, and start the atomization process immediately after injecting the sample. Between injections, flush the graphite tube to eliminate any residual lead by purging at a high temperature as recommended by the manufacturer.)
With the hollow cathode lamp aligned for maximum absorbance, and the wavelength set at 283.3 nm, atomize 20-m l aliquots of the four Standard Solutions, using a 300-ml/min argon flow and the following sequence of conditions: dry at 110° for 30 sec (20 sec ramp period and 10 sec hold time), char at 700° for 42 sec (20 sec ramp period and 22 sec hold time), and, with the argon flow stopped, atomize at 2300° for 7 sec.
Plot a standard curve of concentration, in m g/ml, of each Standard Solution versus its maximum absorbance value compensated for background correction, as directed for the particular instrument. Atomize 20 m l of the Sample Solution under conditions identical to those for the Standard Solution, and measure its background-corrected maximum absorbance. From the standard curve, determine the concentration of lead in the Sample Solution, C, in m g/ml. Calculate the concentration of lead in the Salatrim sample, in mg/kg, using:
10C/W
where
W is the mass, in g, of the sample
Peroxide value
Reagents:
- Acetic acid-chloroform solution: Mix 3 volumes of acetic acid with 2 volumes of chloroform.
- Potassium iodide solution, saturated: Dissolve excess potassium iodide in freshly boiled water. Excess solid must remain. Store in the dark. Test daily by adding 0.5 ml to 30 ml of the acetic acid-chloroform solution, then add 2 drops of starch TS. If the solution turns blue, requiring more than 1 drop of 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate to discharge the colour, prepare a fresh solution.
Procedure:
Weigh accurately about 5 g of the sample into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 30 ml of the acetic acid-chloroform solution and swirl to dissolve. Add 0.5 ml of the saturated potassium iodide solution, allow to stand with occasional shaking for 1 min, and add 30 ml of water. Slowly titrate with 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate with vigorous shaking until the yellow colour is almost gone. Add about 0.5 ml of starch TS, and continue the titration, shaking the flask vigorously to release all the iodine from the chloroform layer, until the blue colour disappears.
Perform a blank determination and make any necessary correction.

Unsaponifiable matter
Maxwell, R.J., Reimann, K.A., and Percell, K. (1981) Determination of the Unsaponifiable Matter in Fatty Acids by a Rapid Column Method, JAOCS 58:1002-1004.
I. Reagents:
Calcium Chloride-Celite Mixture: Using a mortar and pestle, grind 1 part anhydrous calcium chloride with 1 part water; add 3 parts Celite 545 (grade: not acid-washed, C-212). Grind to a uniform consistency. The mixture may be stored in a covered amber jar for up to one month.
Potassium Hydroxide-Celite Mixture: For multiple analyses, prepare in lots of 75 g or more. Using a mortar and pestle, grind 2 parts potassium hydroxide pellets with 1 part water (CAUTION: considerable heat is generated; wear eye protection and gloves); add 4 parts Celite 545. Grind to uniform consistency. The mixture may be stored in a covered amber jar for up to 10 days. II.
Procedure:
Saponification: Place 10 g Potassium Hydroxide-Celite mixture in a 400-ml mortar; accurately weigh 5 g of sample (W[S]) and transfer to the mortar. Grind the mixture until the sample is uniformly distributed. Add another 10 g of Potassium Hydroxide-Celite mixture; grind to uniform consistency. Transfer the mixture to a jar. Transfer any residual sample by sweeping 5 g Celite 545 along the sides of the mortar with the pestle and into the jar. Shake until the mixture is uniform. Heat for 20-30 min in a 130° oven.
Gravimetric Extraction: Transfer the cooled mixture to the mortar; regrind (approximately 30 s) to a uniform granular consistency. Loosely fit a plug of glass wool into the tip of a glass chromatography column (30 mm i.d.; 30 cm long overall, with a drip tip 5 cm x 8 mm o.d.). Pack the column with 5 g of Calcium Chloride-Celite mixture. Transfer the contents of the mortar to the column. Pack to a total bed height of 50-60 mm. Place a 150-ml tared flask under the column. Qualitatively transfer residue from the mortar to the column with about 25 ml dichloromethane. Once this solution has percolated into the column bed, add sufficient dichloromethane so that the column bed is wet and a few drops of eluate have been collected in the flask. Charge the column with 150 ml dichloromethane, and collect the entire volume in the flask (approximately 25 min). Remove the solvent under a stream of nitrogen with gentle heating while the eluate is being collected. Take the contents of the
flask to constant weight under vacuum. Determine the weight of the residue (W[R]).
To check for completeness of extraction, add 20 ml dichloromethane to the column and collect in a second tared flask. Evaporate the contents of the second flask to dryness, and examine for residue. Determine the weight of the residue (W[R1]), if present. If residue is observed, repeat the procedure with an additional 20 ml of dichloromethane.
The total residue weight and the weight of the original sample are used to calculate the percent Unsaponifiable matter:
[(W[R] + W[R1] +...)/W[S]] x 100

I. DETERMINATION OF MONOACYLGLYCERIDE AND TRIACYLGLYCERIDE CONTENT
A. Principle
This method permits the quantitation of monoglycerides (MAG) with one LCFA, and triglycerides (TAG) with the same acyl carbon number (ACN) in Salatrim by high-temperature capillary gas chromatography (HTCGC). (The ACN is the sum of the number of carbons of each carboxylic acid sidechain of each TAG. (e.g., the ACN for tristearin is 54 (i.e., 3 x 18); the ACNs for both dipropionylstearoylglycerol and diacetylarachidoylglycerol are 24 (i.e., [(2 x 3) + 18] and [(2 x 2) + 20], respectively). MAG and TAG are identified by comparison with standards. The weight percent of each MAG and TAG in Salatrim is determined from the peak areas and calibration curves constructed from data from analyses of standard solutions.
B. Materials
MAG Standard: Monopentadecanoin (mono-C15) and monostearin (mono-C18); purity: 99% minimum (available from Nu Check Prep., Inc., Elysian, MN, USA).

C. Sample Preparation
Internal Standard Stock Solution: Dissolve 200 mg tri-C11 in 2 litres of undecane/toluene (95/5, v/v; spectroscopic grade).

2. Quantitation of MAG
a. Calibration Curve and Response Factor (RF) Determination for Mono-C15 and Mono-C18.
Analyze each of the Standard Solutions of Group 2 using a sample injection volume of 0.5 m l. From each chromatogram, establish the response factors (RF[i]) for the two MAG using the following formula:
RF[i] = (C[IS]/C[i]) x (A[i]/A[IS])
where A[IS] is the peak area of the Internal Standard (tri-C11); A[i] is the peak area of a MAG; C[IS] is the concentration of the Internal Standard (100 mg/l); and C[i] is the concentration (mg/l) of a MAG.
For each MAG, construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios of (A[i]/A[IS]) (x-axis) versus the RF[i] (y-axis) for each solution.
b. Weight Percent of MAG
Analyze the Salatrim sample using a sample injection of 0.5 m l. From the chromatograms, obtain the peak area of each MAG (A[i]), and of the Internal Standard (A[IS]). Example chromatograms of Salatrim are provided in the Appendix to this monograph. Calculate the peak area ratio (A[i]/A[IS]) and determine the RF for each MAG (RF[i]) from the calibration curve. The concentration (m g/ml) of each MAG (C[i]) in the Salatrim sample is:
C[i] = (C[IS]/RF[i]) x (A[i]/A[IS])
where C[IS] is the concentration of the Internal Standard (tri-C11; 100 mg/l). The weight percent of each MAG in the Salatrim sample ((W%)[i]) is:
(W%)[i] = (C[i]/C[T]) x 100
where C[T] is the concentration of Salatrim Solution (2000 mg/l). The total weight percent of MAG in the Salatrim sample is:
S [i] (W%)[i].
3. Quantitation of TAG with the Same ACN
a. Determination of RF for TAG Standards
Analyze each of the Standard Solutions of Group 1 using a sample injection volume of 0.5 m l. The RF for each TAG standard, j, is:
RF[n,j] = (C[IS]/C[n,j]) x (A[n,j]/A[IS])
where A[IS] is the peak area of the Internal Standard; A[n,j] is the peak area of the TAG standard with ACN = n (where n = 18-54 and the ACN of the TAG standards is as follows: tri-C6, 18; tri-C7, 21; tri-C8, 24; tri-C9, 27; tri-C10, 30; tri-C11, 33; tri-C12, 36; tri-C13, 39; tri-C14, 42; tri-C15, 45; tri-C16, 48; tri-C-17, 51; and tri-C18, 54) and concentration C[n,j] (mg/l); C[IS] is the concentration of the Internal Standard (100 mg/l).
The relative peak area of each TAG standard with ACN = n and concentration C[n,j] to that of the Internal Standard is given by:
RA[n,j] = A[n,j]/A[IS]
The RF and relative peak areas for each TAG with ACN = (n + 1) and with ACN = (n + 2) are calculated from the measured RF and RA values for TAG standards with ACN = n and (n + 3) at the same concentration, C[n,j], according to the following:
RF[n+1,j] = RF[n,j] + (RF[n+3,j] - RF[n,j]) x 1/3
RA[n+1,j] = RA[n,j] + (RA[n+3,j] - RA[n,j]) x 1/3
RF[n+2,j] = RF[n,j] + (RF[n+3,j] - RF[n,j]) x 2/3
RA[n+2,j] = RA[n,j] + (RA[n+3,j] - RA[n,j]) x 2/3
b. Determination of RF for Salatrim
For the Salatrim Sample, the RF for the TAG with a relative peak area RA[n,j ]is calculated from:
RF[n,j] = RF[n,j-1] + (RF[n,j+1] - RF[n,j-1]) x [(RA[n,j] - RA[n,j-1])/(RA[n.j+1] - RA[n,j-1])]
where RF[n,j+1] and RF[n,j-1] are the RFs, and RA[n,j+1] and RA[n,j-1] are the relative peak areas, respectively, of the TAG standard with the same ACN value. RA[n,j+1] and RA[n,j-1] must meet the following condition:
RA[n,j-1] £ RA[n,j] < RA[n,j+1]
where RA[n,j] is the ratio of the peak area of the TAG in Salatrim with ACN = n, (A[n,j]), to the peak area for the Internal Standard (A[IS]). (NOTE: The notation "j+1", "j", and "j-1" denotes consecutive concentration values in the series of standard solutions. For example, for a TAG standard with ACN = n and concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mg/L, the relative peak areas RA[n,j+1 ]and RA[n,j-1] correspond to data for standards with concentrations of 400 mg/l and 100 mg/l, respectively)
c. Weight Percent Determination of Salatrim TAG Components
The concentration (mg/l) of TAG in the Salatrim Sample with ACN = n is given by
C[n,j] = (C[IS]/RF[n,j]) x (A[n,j]/A[IS])
where C[IS] is the concentration of the Internal Standard (tri-C11; 100 mg/l).
The weight percent of TAG with ACN = n in Salatrim is:
(W%)[n] = (C[n,j]/C[T]) X 100
where C[T] is the concentration of the Salatrim sample (2000 mg/l).
The total weight percent of TAG in the Salatrim sample is:
S [n] (W%)[n].
II. DETERMINATION OF THE SCFA/LCFA MOLE RATIO
Either of the two methods given below may be used.
METHOD I
A. Principle: Triglycerides are converted to fatty acid butyl esters and determined by capillary column FID gas chromatography.
B. Apparatus: Gas chromatograph with FID (Hewlett Packard HP 5890 capillary columns, equipped with 5 m l syringe for 0.32 mm i.d. columns. Automatic sampler (HP 7673, or equivalent). Chromatographic data system or integrator (HP 3365 Series II software, or equivalent). Retention gap, deactivated fused silica, 1 mm x 0.32 mm i.d. with capillary column connectors. DB 5-HT, 15 m x 0.32 mm i.d. fused silica capillary column (J&W Scientific, Inc., 91 Blue Ravine Road, Folsom, California 95630-4714, USA; catalog no. 123-5711 or equivalent). Crimp caps and vials (HP 5181-3375, or equivalent) for on-line autosampler.
C. Reagents: Sodium butoxide (50% in butanol); hexane (HPLC grade, 95%); hydrochloric acid (0.5 N volumetric standard); butyl butyrate (98%); n-butyl acetate (99%); butyl propionate; butyl palmitate; butyl stearate (93%); 1-butanol (anhydrous, 99%).
D. Solutions: 0.5 N Sodium Butoxide: Transfer 9.62 g of 50% sodium butoxide solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, dilute to the mark with 1-butanol, and mix.
Standard Reference Solution: Weigh accurately approximately 50 mg of each butyl ester standard (5 standards) into a single 100-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with hexane and mix. More than one Standard Reference Solution may be necessary if impurities co-elute with standard peaks. (NOTE: Melt butyl stearate standard before sampling.)
Sample Solution: Weigh accurately approximately 50 mg of Salatrim (melt, sample is solid) into a 100-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with hexane and mix.
Butyl Ester Conversion: For each sample to be assayed (hexane blank, Standard Reference Solutions, Sample Solutions), pipet 5.0 ml of solution into a clean 2 dram (8 ml) clear glass vial. Add 0.5 ml of 0.5 N Sodium Butoxide, seal and shake vigorously (solution will turn yellow). Allow the solution to stand for 2 minutes (for hexane blank and Sample Solutions, only); then, neutralize by pipetting 1.0 ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid into the solution. Seal and shake well until the solution is clear. Check pH with pH paper. The solution should be acidic. If it is not, the column will degrade. (NOTE: For the Standard Reference Solution, 1-butanol and water may be substituted for 0.5 N Sodium Butoxide and 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, respectively.)

F. Calculations
Response Factors for Butyl Ester Standards (RF[i]):
RF[i] = A[i]/(W[i] x (%purity)[i]/100)
where A[i] is the average peak area counts for the ith standard; W[i] is the weight (m g) of the ith standard in the reference solution; and (% purity)[i] is the purity of the ith standard expressed as a percentage.
Weights of Butyl Esters in the Sample:
W[i] = A[i]/Rf[i]
where W[i] is the weight (m g) of the ith ester in the sample; A[i] is the peak area counts for the ith ester in the sample; RF[i] is the response factor for the ith ester standard (average area counts/m g).
Weights of Fatty Acids in the Sample:
(W[i])[fatty acid] = (W[i])[butyl ester] x (MW[i])[fatty acid]/(MW[i])[butyl ester]
where (W[i])[fatty acid] and (W[i])[butyl ester] are, respectively, the weights (m g) of the ith fatty acid and its butyl ester in the sample; and (MW[i])[fatty acid] and (MW[i])[butyl ester ]are their respective molecular weights.
Calculation of Short/Long (S/L) Mole Ratio:
(mmoles[i])[fatty acid] = (W[i])[fatty acid]/(1000 x (MW[i])[fatty acid])
S/L mole ratio = S [i] (mmoles[i])[SCFA]/S [i] (mmoles[i])[LCFA]
where (W[i])[fatty acid] is in m g, (MW[i]) is in mg/mmole, and S [i] (mmoles[i])[SCFA] and S [i] (mmoles[i])[LCFA] are the respective sums of the millimoles of the short chain fatty acids (C[2] - C[4]) and the long chain fatty acids (C[14] -C[18]).
METHOD II
1. Principle: Fatty acid residues are identified using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.
2. Apparatus: A nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (e.g., Varian VXR-300 or equivalent).
3. Reagents: Deuterated chloroform.
4. Sample Solutions: Place a small amount of cotton in a Pasteur pipet and pack it down. Place this pipet in an NMR tube. Place 10 mg of sample in a clean 2 dram (8 ml) vial. Add deuterated chloroform to a height of about 1 cm and dissolve the sample completely. Pass the sample solution through the Pasteur pipet filter into the NMR tube so that the height of the sample solution reaches the bottom of the pitet. Remove the pipet and cap the tube.
5. Procedure:
Instrument settings: Delay time, 10 s; number of transients, 16; sweep width, 5000 Hz; transmitter nucleus, HI; acquisition time, 3.74 sec.
Operating parameters: Place the NMR sample tube into the magnet and maintain spinning at 20 Hz. Obtain the deuterium lock frequency by adjusting the 20 shim gradient.

IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Precipitate formation with calcium chloride
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-fifth of its volume of a 2.5% solution of calcium chloride. A voluminous, gelatinous precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes sodium alginate from gum arabic, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, gelatin, gum ghatti, karaya gum, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and tragacanth gum.
Precipitate formation with ammonium sulphate
To a 0.5% solution of the sample in sodium hydroxide TS add one-half of its volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. No precipitate is formed. This test distinguishes sodium alginate from agar, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, de-esterified pectin, gelatin, carob bean gum, methyl cellulose and starch.
Test for alginate
Moisten 1-5 mg of the sample with water and add 1 ml of acid ferric sulfate TS. Within 5 min, a cherry-red colour develops that finally becomes deep purple.
PURITY TESTS
Water-insoluble matter
Disperse 2 g of the sample, weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg, in 800 ml of water in a 2,000-ml flask. Neutralize to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide TS and then add 3 ml in excess. Add 40 ml of hydrogen peroxide solution containing 30% by weight H[2]O[2], cover the flask and boil for 1 h with frequent stirring. Filter while hot through a tared Gooch crucible provided with a glass fibre filter (2.4 cm, No 934 AH, Reeve Angel & Co, Clifton, N.Y., USA, or equivalent). If slow filtration is caused by high viscosity of the sample solution, boil until the viscosity is reduced enough to permit filtration. Wash the crucible thoroughly with hot water, dry the crucible and its contents at 105° for 1 h, cool and weigh. Calculate as percentage of the dry weight.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Proceed as directed under Carbon Dioxide Determination by Decarboxylation in the General Methods. Each ml of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide consumed is equivalent to 5.5 mg of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) or 27.75 mg of sodium alginate (equivalent weight 222).

TESTS
IDENTIFICATION TESTS
Foam test
Vigorously shake a 0.1% solution of the sample. No layer of foam appears. This test distinguishes sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, whether hydrolysed or not, from other cellulose ethers and from alginates and natural gums.
Precipitate formation
To 5 ml of an 0.5% solution of the sample add 5 ml of a 5% solution of copper sulfate or of aluminium sulfate. A precipitate appears. This test distinguishes sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, whether hydrolysed or not, from other cellulose ethers, and from gelatine, carob bean gum and tragacanth gum.
Colour reaction
Add 0.5 g of the powdered sample to 50 ml of water, while stirring to produce a uniform dispersion. Continue the stirring until a clear solution is produced. Dilute 1 ml of the solution with 1 ml of water in a small test tube. Add 5 drops of 1-naphthol TS. Incline the tube, and carefully introduce down the side of the tube 2 ml of sulphuric acid so that it forms a lower layer. A red-purple colour develops at the interface.
Viscosity (60% solids)
To 40 ml of water, add 60 g of the sample, stirring continuously. To ensure the formation of a clear solution without air bubbles, leave the solution to stand in a refrigerator (+4°) for several hours. Using a Bohlin viscometer or an equivalent instrument, measure the viscosity of the solution at 25° using a shear rate of 147 sec^-1.
PURITY TESTS
Sodium chloride
Heat 5 g of the sample, weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg, in a platinum or porcelain crucible, first with a small flame so that the sample does not ignite and then, when the charring is complete, heat further in an electric oven for 15 min at about 500°. After cooling, pulverize the ashes thus obtained and extract several times with warm water. Filter the extracts into a 500-ml volumetric flask, acidify with nitric acid and dilute to the mark with water. Determine the NaCl content of 100 ml of this extract by the method of Volhard, using 0.2 N silver nitrate and 0.02 N ammonium thiocyanate. Each ml of 0.02 N silver nitrate is equivalent to 1.169 mg of NaCl. Calculate the sodium chloride content by the formula:
% NaCl = [(a x 0.001169 x 5)/b] x 100
where
a = 0.02 N silver nitrate consumed (ml)
b = dry weight of the sample (g)
Sodium glycolate
Proceed as directed under the method for Chromatography (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) using the following conditions and using pure glycolic acid as the reference substance:
Column:
Two cation exchange columns in the H^+-form in series, e.g. two Fast Fruit Juice columns, 15 cm x 7.8 mm, Waters, or equivalent
Elution:
Isocratic
Mobile phase:
Aqueous 0.05% phosphoric acid
Flow:
0.5 ml/min
Detector type:
UV or diode array, 205 nm
Sample size:
50 m l of a solution of 200.0 mg of the sample in 20 ml of eluent
Degree of substitution
Weigh accurately about 200 mg of the sample, previously dried at 105° to constant weight, and transfer it into a 250 ml, glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. Add 75 ml of glacial acetic acid, and connect the flask with a water-cooled condenser, and reflux gently on a hot plate for 2h. Cool, transfer the solution to a 250-ml beaker with the aid of 50 ml of glacial acetic acid, and titrate with 0.1 N perchloric acid in dioxane while stirring with a magnetic stirrer. Determine the endpoint potentiometrically with a pH meter equipped with a standard glass electrode and a calomel electrode modified as follows: Discard the aqueous potassium chloride solution, rinse and fill with the supernatant liquid obtained by shaking thoroughly 2 g each of potassium chloride and silver chloride (or silver oxide) with 100 ml of methanol, then add a few crystals of potassium chloride and silver chloride (or silver oxide) to the electrode.
Record the ml of 0.1 N perchloric acid versus mV (0 to 700 mV range), and continue the titration to a few ml beyond the endpoint. Plot the titration curve, and read the volume (A), in ml, of 0.1 N perchloric acid at the inflection point.
Calculate the degree of substitution (DS) by the formula
(16.2A/G)/[1.000 - (8.0 A/G)],
where
A = the volume of 0.1 N perchloric acid required (ml)
G = weight of the sample taken (mg)
16.2 = one-tenth of the formula weight of one anhydroglucose unit
8.0 = one-tenth of the formula weight of one sodium carboxymethyl group
Residual enzyme activity
Prepare a 5% solution of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose having a viscosity of 25-50 mPas as a 2% solution. To 20 g of this solution, add 2 g of a 20% aqueous solution of the sample. Using a Bohlin viscometer or an equivalent instrument, follow the viscosity of the mixture for 10 minutes at 25°, using a shear rate of 147 sec^-1. No change in viscosity (indicating hydrolysis of the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), occurs.
As a control, measure the viscosity of 2 g of water and 20 g of the same sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution.
METHOD OF ASSAY
Calculate the percentage of enzyme treated sodium carboxymethyl cellulose by subtracting from 100 the sum of the percentages of sodium chloride and sodium glycolate, determined separately by the procedures above.

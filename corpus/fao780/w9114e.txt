<title>Understanding the Codex Alimentarius</title>
<section>1</section>
PREFACE
The Codex Alimentarius, or the food code, has become the seminal global reference point for consumers, food producers and processors, national food control agencies and the international food trade. The code has had an enormous impact on the thinking of food producers and processors as well as on the awareness of the end users - the consumers. Its influence extends to every continent, and its contribution to the protection of public health and fair practices in the food trade is immeasurable.
The Codex Alimentarius system presents a unique opportunity for all countries to join the international community in formulating and harmonizing food standards and ensuring their global implementation.
It also allows them a role in the development of codes governing hygienic processing practices and recommendations relating to compliance with
those standards.
The significance of the food code for consumer health protection was underscored in 1985 by the United Nations Resolution 39/248, whereby guidelines were adopted for use in the elaboration and reinforcement of consumer protection policies. The guidelines advise that "Governments should take into account the need of all consumers for food security and should support and, as far as possible, adopt standards from the ... Codex Alimentarius" of FAO and the World Health Organization.
The Codex Alimentarius has relevance to the international food trade. With respect to the ever-increasing global market, in particular, the advantages of having universally uniform food standards for the protection of consumers are self-evident. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) both encourage the international harmonization of food standards. A product of the Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations, the SPS Agreement cites Codex standards, guidelines and recommendations as the preferred international measures for facilitating international trade in food. As such, Codex standards have become the benchmarks against which national food measures and regulations are evaluated within the legal parameters of the Uruguay Round Agreements.
The purpose of this booklet is to foster a wider understanding of the evolving food code and of the activities carried out by the Codex Alimentarius Commission - the body responsible for compiling the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius.

The Codex achievement
A SINGLE INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE POINT
Since the first steps were taken in 1961 to establish a Codex Alimentarius, the Codex Alimentarius Commission - the body charged with developing a food code - has drawn world attention to the field of food quality and safety. During the past three decades or more, all important aspects of food pertaining to the protection of consumer health and fair practices in the food trade have come under the Commission's scrutiny. In the best traditions of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as part of its persistent endeavours to develop the Codex Alimentarius the Commission has encouraged food-related scientific and technological research as well as discussion. In doing so, it has lifted the world community's awareness of food safety and related issues to unprecedented heights and has consequently become the single most important international reference point for developments associated with food standards.
GREATER GLOBAL AND NATIONAL AWARENESS
Throughout much of the world, an increasing number of consumers and most governments are becoming aware of food quality and safety issues and are realizing the need to be selective about the foods people eat. It is now common for consumers to demand that their governments take legislative action to ensure that only safe food of acceptable quality is sold and that the risk of food-borne health hazards is minimized. It is fair to say that, through its elaboration of Codex standards and its consideration of all related issues, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has helped significantly to put food as an entity on political agendas. In fact, governments are extremely conscious of the political consequences to be expected should they fail to heed consumers' concerns regarding the food they eat.
INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Codex Alimentarius Commission has been supported in its work by the now universally accepted maxim that people have the right to expect their food to be safe, of good quality and suitable for consumption. Food-borne illnesses are at best unpleasant - at worst they can be fatal. But there are other consequences. Outbreaks of food-borne illness can damage trade and tourism and can lead
to loss of earnings, unemployment and litigation. Poor-quality food can destroy the commercial credibility of suppliers, both nationally and internationally, while food spoilage is wasteful and costly and can adversely affect trade and consumer confidence.
The positive effect of the Commission's work has also been enhanced by the declarations produced by international conferences and meetings which have, themselves, been influenced by the Commission's activities. In recent years, national representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, the FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food Trade (held in cooperation with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), the FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition and the FAO World Food Summit have either encouraged or committed their countries to adopt measures ensuring the safety and quality of foods.
FOSTERING CONSUMER PROTECTION WORLDWIDE
The United Nations General Assembly Guidelines for Consumer Protection
Stated that:
"When formulating national policies and plans with regard to food, Governments should take into account the need of all consumers for food security and should support and, as far as possible, adopt standards from the Food and Agriculture Organization's ... and the World Health Organization's Codex Alimentarius ...".
The FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food Trade (in cooperation with GATT)
Agreed that:
... "The process of harmonizing national food regulations to bring them into line with inter-national standards and recommendations was an urgent one, which needed to be accelerated ..."
and that:
"Provisions essential for consumer protection (health, safety of food, etc.) should be the focus of emphasis in Codex standards ...".
The FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition
Recognized that:
"Access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is a right of each individual."
and that:
"Food regulations ... should fully take into account the recommended international standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission."
The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
Formally recognized:
International standards, guidelines and recommendations, including the Codex Alimentarius, as reference points for facilitating international trade and resolving trade disputes in international law.
The FAO World Food Summit
Committed itself to:
"Implement policies aimed at ... improving physical and economic access by all, at all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and its effective utilization."
and to:
"Apply measures, in conformity with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and other relevant international agreements, that ensure the quality and safety of food supply ... ".
BROAD COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
The role of the Codex Alimentarius Commission has evolved with development of the Codex itself. The task of creating a food code is immense and, because of continuing research and product development, virtually endless. The finalization of food standards and their compilation into a code that is credible and authoritative requires extensive consultation as well as the collection and evaluation of information, followed up by confirmation of final results and sometimes objective compromise to satisfy differing sound, scientifically based views.
Creating standards that at once protect consumers, ensure fair practices in the sale of food and facilitate trade is a process that involves specialists in numerous food-related scientific disciplines, together with consumers' organizations, production and processing industries, food control administrators and traders. As more people become involved in the formulation of standards and as the Codex Alimentarius - including related codes and recommendations - covers further ground, so the Commission's activities are becoming better known and its influence strengthened and widened.
Codex Alimentarius - what it comprises
- Food standards for commodities (237)
- Codes of hygienic or technological practice (41)
- Pesticides evaluated (185)
- Limits for pesticide residues (3 274)
- Guidelines for contaminants (25)
- Food additives evaluated (1 005)
- Veterinary drugs evaluated (54)
A CODE OF SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND STANDARDS
While the Codex Alimentarius as it stands is a remarkable achievement, it would be quite wrong to see it as the only product of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, although it is the most important. Resulting from the creation of the Codex, another major accomplishment has been to sensitize the global community to the danger of food hazards as well as to the importance of food quality and hence to the need for food standards. By providing an international focal point and forum for informed dialogue on issues relevant to food, the Codex Alimentarius Commission fulfils a crucial role. In support of its work on food standards and codes of practice, it generates reputable scientific texts, convenes numerous expert committees and consultations as well as international meetings attended by the best-informed individuals and organizations concerned with food and related fields. Countries have responded by introducing long-overdue food legislation and Codex-based standards and by
establishing or strengthening food control agencies to monitor compliance with such regulations.
The Codex Alimentarius now has such a well-established reputation as an international reference that it has become customary for health authorities, government food control officials, manufacturers, scientists and consumer advocates to ask first of all: What does the Codex Alimentarius have to say? - a notable achievement indeed.

Origins of the Codex Alimentarius
ANCIENT TIMES
Evidence from the earliest historical writings indicates that governing authorities were already then concerned with codifying rules to protect consumers from dishonest practices in the sale of food. Assyrian tablets described the method to be used in determining the correct weights and measures for foodgrains, and Egyptian scrolls prescribed the labelling to be applied to certain foods. In ancient Athens, beer and wines were inspected for purity and soundness, and the Romans had a well-organized state food control system to protect consumers from fraud or bad produce. In Europe during the Middle Ages, individual countries passed laws concerning the quality and safety of eggs, sausages, cheese, beer, wine and bread. Some of these ancient statutes still exist today.
A SCIENTIFIC BASE
The second half of the nineteenth century saw the first general food laws adopted and basic food control systems put in place to monitor compliance. During the same period, food chemistry came to be recognized as a reputable discipline and the determination of the "purity" of a food was primarily based on the chemical parameters of simple food composition. When harmful industrial chemicals were used to disguise the true colour or nature of food, the concept of "adulteration" was extended to include the use of hazardous chemicals in food. Science had begun providing tools with which to disclose dishonest practices in the sale of food and to distinguish between safe and unsafe edible products.
Report of the First Meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Nutrition, 1950 - an extract
"Food regulations in different countries are often conflicting and contradictory. Legislation governing preservation, nomenclature and acceptable food standards often varies widely from country to country. New legislation not based on scientific knowledge is often introduced, and little account may be taken of nutritional principles in formulating regulations."
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1897 and 1911, a collection of standards and product descriptions for a wide variety of foods was developed as the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus. Although lacking legal force, it was used as a reference by the courts to determine standards of identity for specific foods. The present-day Codex Alimentarius draws its name from the Austrian code.

TRADE CONCERNS
The different sets of standards arising from the spontaneous and independent development of food laws and standards by different countries inevitably gave rise to trade barriers that were of increasing concern to food traders in the early twentieth century. Trade associations that were formed as a reaction to such barriers pressured governments to harmonize their various food standards so as to facilitate trade in safe foods of a defined quality. The International Dairy Federation (IDF), founded in 1903, was one such association. Its work on standards for milk and milk products later provided a catalyst in the establishment of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and in the setting of its procedures for elaborating standards.
When FAO and WHO were founded in the late 1940s, there was heightened international concern about the direction being taken in the field of food regulation. Countries were acting independently and there was little, if any, consultation among them with a view to harmonization. This situation is reflected in the observations of international meetings of the time.
CONSUMERS' CONCERNS
In the 1940s, rapid progress was made in food science and technology. With the advent of more sensitive analytical tools, knowledge about the nature of food, its quality and associated health hazards also grew quickly. There was intense interest in food microbiology, food chemistry and associated disciplines, and new discoveries were considered newsworthy. Articles about food at all levels flourished and consumers were bombarded with messages in popular magazines, in the tabloid press and on the radio. Some were correct, some incorrect - but all were intended to absorb interest and many were overly sensational.
Despite the questionable quality of some of the information disseminated, however, the outcome was an increase
in the public's food consciousness and, consequently, knowledge about food safety gradually grew.
At the same time, as more and more information about food and related matters became available, there was greater apprehension on the part of consumers. Whereas, previously, consumers' concerns had extended only as far as the "visibles"- underweight contents, size variations, misleading labelling and poor quality - they now embraced a fear of the "invisibles",
i.e. health hazards could not be seen, smelled or tasted, such as micro-organisms, pesticide residues, environmental contaminants and food additives. With the blossoming of well-organized and informed consumers' groups, both internationally and nationally, there was growing pressure
on governments worldwide to protect communities from poor-quality and hazardous foods.
The problem of food additives
In 1955, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Nutrition recorded that:
"... the increasing, and sometimes insufficiently controlled, use of food additives has become a matter of public and administrative concern."
The Committee also noted that the means of solving problems arising from the use of food additives may differ from country to country and stated that this fact:
"... must in itself occasion concern, since the existence of widely differing control measures may well form an undesirable deterrent to international trade."
A DESIRE FOR LEADERSHIP
Food regulators, traders, consumers and experts were looking increasingly to FAO and WHO for leadership in unravelling the skein of food regulations that were impeding trade and providing mostly inadequate protection for consumers. In 1953, WHO's governing body, the World Health Assembly, stated that the widening use of chemicals in food presented a new public health problem, and it was proposed that the two organizations should conduct relevant studies. One such study identified the use of food additives as a critical factor.
As a result, FAO and WHO convened the first joint FAO/WHO Conference on Food Additives in 1955. From that Conference eventuated the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) which, more than 40 years after its inception, still meets regularly. JECFA's work continues to be of fundamental importance to the activities of the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants as well as to the Codex Commission's deliberations on standards for food additives.
The development of food commodity standards in the 1950s*^
- Stresa Convention - Introduced the practice of naming and specifying the composition of particular cheeses
- ECE Committee on Inland Transport - Set quality standards for fresh fruits and vegetables moving in trade in Europe
- FAO and ECE - Set requirements and analytical procedures for determining the purity of fruit juices
- ECE - Set standards for quick-frozen fruits and vegetables
- IDF - Set standards and labelling requirements for milk and milk products
*All the activities listed here have since been taken up by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
INTEGRATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES
While FAO and WHO furthered their involvement in food-related matters, a variety of committees set up by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also began working in earnest on standards for food commodities. In time, the work of those NGO committees was either assumed by or continued jointly with the appropriate Codex Alimentarius commodity committees and, in some cases, the non-governmental committees themselves became Codex committees.
A demonstrated need for harmonization
The Codex Alimentarius came into being in response to a widely recognized need. It did not just happen. It was the product of a long evolutionary process involving a wide cross-section of the global community. Many people representing many interests and disciplines were involved in the process, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that, as long as the need perceived by those people remains, so the Codex Alimentarius will remain.
INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION
Two landmark years in the foundation of the Codex Alimentarius were 1960 and 1961. In October 1960, the first FAO Regional Conference for Europe crystallized a widely held view when it recognized:
"The desirability of international agreement on minimum food standards and related questions (including labelling requirements, methods of analysis, etc.) ... as an important means of protecting the consumer's health, of ensuring quality and of reducing trade barriers, particularly in the rapidly integrating market of Europe."
The Conference also felt that:
"... coordination of the growing number of food standards programmes undertaken by many organizations presented a particular problem."
Within four months of the regional conference, FAO entered into discussions with WHO, ECE, OECD and the Council of the Codex Alimentarius Europeaus with proposals that would lead to the establishment of an international food standards programme.
In November 1961, the Eleventh Session of the Conference of FAO passed a resolution to set up the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
In May 1963, the Sixteenth World Health Assembly approved the establishment of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme and adopted the statutes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

The Codex system: FAO, WHO and the Codex Alimentarius Commission
The Codex Alimentarius Commission was born of necessity.
Its carefully crafted Statutes and Rules of Procedure ensure it pursues its clearly defined objectives in a disciplined, dispassionate and scientific way.
THE COMMISSION
The Eleventh Session of the Conference of FAO in 1961 and the Sixteenth World Health Assembly in 1963 both passed resolutions to establish the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The two bodies also adopted the Statutes and Rules of Procedure for the Commission.
The Statutes provide the legal basis for the Commission's work and formally reflect the concepts behind and reasons for its establishment. Article 1 of the Statutes provides the Commission with its purposes, terms of reference and objectives. Article 2 defines eligibility for membership of the Commission which is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO and WHO. In 1998, membership comprised 163 countries, representing 97 percent of the world's population.
The Rules of Procedure of the Codex Alimentarius Commission describe and formalize working procedures appropriate to an intergovernmental body. They provide for:
* conditions of membership of the Commission;
* the appointment of Commission officers, including the chairperson, three vice-chairpersons, regional coordinators and a secretary, and prescribe their responsibilities;
* the establishment of an executive committee to meet between Commission sessions, to act on behalf of the Commission as its executive organ;
* the frequency and operation of Commission sessions;
* the nature of agendas for Commission sessions;
* voting procedures;
* observers;
* preparation of Commission records and reports;
* the establishment of subsidiary bodies;
* the procedures to be adopted in the elaboration of standards;
* the allocation of a budget and estimates of expenditure;
* languages to be used by the Commission.
Representation. The Commission is truly an international body. Since it was formed, it has held 22 sessions, with chairpersons from Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Vice-chairpersons have been drawn from Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Senegal, the Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Regional representatives to the Commission have been provided by the Governments of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Cuba, the former Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Senegal, Thailand, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the former USSR.
The Commission meets every two years, alternately at FAO headquarters in Rome and at WHO headquarters in Geneva. Plenary sessions are attended by as many as 500 people. Representation at sessions is on a country basis. National delegations are led by senior officials appointed by their governments. Delegations may, and often do, include representatives of industry, consumers' organizations and academic institutes. Countries that are not yet members of the Commission sometimes attend in an observer capacity.
A number of international governmental organizations and international NGOs also attend in an observer capacity. Although they are "observers", the tradition of the Codex Alimentarius Commission allows such organizations to put forward their points of view at every stage except in the final decision, which is the exclusive prerogative of Member Governments.
To facilitate continuous contact with member countries, the Commission, in collaboration with national governments, has established country Codex Contact Points and many member countries have National Codex Committees to coordinate activities nationally.
Interest in Codex Alimentarius activities has been growing steadily since the Commission began, and the increasing involvement of developing countries in its work has been a highlight of the progress made as well as a vindication of the foresight shown by the founders of the Commission.
Statutes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission
ARTICLE 1
The Codex Alimentarius Commission shall ... be responsible for making proposals to, and shall be consulted by, the Directors-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on all matters pertaining to the implementation of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, the purpose of which is:
(a) protecting the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in the food trade;
(b) promoting coordination of all food stan-dards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations;
(c) determining priorities and initiating and guiding the preparation of draft standards through and with the aid of appropriate organizations;
(d) finalizing standards elaborated under (c) above and, after acceptance by governments, publishing them in a Codex Alimentarius either as regional or world wide standards, together with international standards already finalized by other bodies under (b) above, wherever this is practicable;
(e) amending published standards, after appropriate survey in the light of developments.
The purposes or objectives embraced by Article 1 resulted from a long process of fashioning and refining. Based on a deep insight into and understanding of events that led to the Commission's establishment, they encapsulate the intentions of the Commission's founders.
Who comes to Codex?
THE COMMISSION'S OPERATIONS
Compiling the Codex Alimentarius
As stated in Article 1 of the Commission's statutes, one of the principal purposes of the Commission is the preparation of food standards and their publication in the Codex Alimentarius.
The legal base for the Commission's operations and the procedures it is required to follow are published in the Codex Alimentarius - procedural manual, currently in its tenth edition. Like all other aspects of the Commission's work, the procedures for preparing standards are well defined, open and transparent. In essence they involve:
* The submission of a proposal for a standard to be developed by a national government or a subsidiary committee of the Commission.
* A decision by the Commission or the Executive Committee that a standard be developed as proposed. "Formal Criteria for the Establishment of Work Priorities and for the Establishment of Subsidiary Bodies" exist to assist the Commission or Executive Committee in their decision-making and in selecting or creating the subsidiary body to be responsible for steering the standard through its development.
* The preparation of a proposed draft standard is arranged by the Commission Secretariat and circulated to Member Governments for comment.
* Comments are considered by the subsidiary body that has been allocated responsibility for the development of the proposed draft standard, and this subsidiary body may present the text to the Commission as a draft standard.
* If the Commission adopts the draft standard, it is sent to governments a number of times in a step procedure which, if completed satisfactorily, results in the draft becoming a Codex standard. In an accelerated procedure, the number of steps required for the development of a standard varies from a maximum of eight to a minimum of five. In some circumstances, steps may be repeated. Most standards take a number of years to develop.
* Once adopted by the Commission, a Codex standard is added to the Codex Alimentarius.
A "Format for Codex Commodity Standards and their Content" is provided by the General Principles of the Codex Alimentarius. It includes the following categories of information:
* Scope - including the name of the standard;
* Description, essential composition and quality factors - defining the minimum standard for the food;
* Food additives - only those cleared by FAO and WHO may be used;
* Contaminants;
* Hygiene and weights and measures;
* Labelling - in accordance with the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods;
* Methods of analysis and sampling.
In addition to commodity standards, the Codex Alimentarius includes general standards, which have across-the-board application to all foods and are not product-specific. There are general standards or recommendations for:
* food labelling;
* food additives;
* contaminants;
* methods of analysis and sampling;
* food hygiene;
* nutrition and foods for special dietary uses;
* food import and export inspection and certification systems;
* residues of veterinary drugs in foods;
* pesticide residues in foods.
Revision of Codex standards. The Commission and its subsidiary bodies are committed to revision of Codex standards and related texts as necessary to ensure they are consistent with and reflect current scientific knowledge. Each member of the Commission is responsible for identifying and presenting to the appropriate committee any new scientific and other relevant information that may warrant revision of existing Codex standards or related texts. The procedure for revision follows that used for the initial preparation of standards (outlined at the beginning of this section).
Structure of the Codex Alimentarius
* Volume 1A - General requirements
* Volume 1B - General requirements (food hygiene)
* Volume 2A - Pesticide residues in foods (general texts)
* Volume 2B - Pesticide residues in foods (maximum residue limits)
* Volume 3 - Residues of veterinary drugs in foods
* Volume 4 - Foods for special dietary uses (including foods for infants and children)
* Volume 5A - Processed and quick-frozen fruits and vegetables
* Volume 5B - Fresh fruits and vegetables
* Volume 6 - Fruit juices
* Volume 7 - Cereals, pulses (legumes) and derived products and vegetable proteins
* Volume 8 - Fats and oils and related products
* Volume 9 - Fish and fishery products
* Volume 10 - Meat and meat products; soups and broths
* Volume 11 - Sugars, cocoa products and chocolate and miscellaneous products
* Volume 12 - Milk and milk products
* Volume 13 - Methods of analysis and sampling
Collectively, the volumes contain general principles, general standards, definitions, codes, commodity standards, methods and recommendations. The contents list of each volume is well organized for ease of reference. For example:
Volume 1A - General Requirements
1. General Principles of the Codex Alimentarius
2. Definitions for the Purpose of Codex Alimentarius
3. Code of Ethics for International Trade in Foods
4. Food Labelling
5. Food Additives - including the General Standard for Food Additives
6. Contaminants in Food - including the General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Foods
7. Irradiated Foods
8. Food Import and Export Food Inspection and Certification Systems
Published volumes of the Codex Alimentarius are available in English, French and Spanish, and individual standards are being made available on the World Wide Web and CD-ROM.
SUBSIDIARY BODIES
Under its Rules of Procedure, the Commission is empowered to establish two kinds of subsidiary body:
* Codex Committees, which prepare draft standards for submission to the Commission.
* Coordinating Committees, through which regions or groups of countries coordinate food standards activities in the region, including the development of regional standards.
A feature of the committee system is that, with few exceptions, each committee is hosted by a member country, which is chiefly responsible for the cost of the committee's maintenance and administration and for providing its chairperson.
Codex Committees are classed as either General Subject Committees or Commodity Committees.
General Subject Committees are so called because their work has relevance for all Commodity Committees and, since this work applies across the board to all commodity standards, General Subject Committees are sometimes referred to as "horizontal committees". There are nine such committees:
* Committee on General Principles, hosted by France
* Committee on Food Labelling, hosted by Canada
* Committee on Methods of Analysis and Sampling, hosted by Hungary
* Committee on Food Hygiene, hosted by the United States
* Committee on Pesticide Residues, hosted by the Netherlands
* Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants, hosted by the Netherlands
* Committee on Import/Export Inspection and Certification Systems, hosted by Australia
* Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, hosted by Germany (a General Committee for the purpose of Nutrition)
* Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Food, hosted by the
United States
Among other things, the General Subject Committees develop all-embracing concepts and principles applying to foods in general, specific foods or groups of foods; endorse or review relevant provisions in Codex commodity standards and, based on the advice of expert scientific bodies, develop major recommendations pertaining to consumers' health and safety.
Commodity Committees have responsibility for developing standards for specific foods or classes of food. In order to distinguish them from the "horizontal committees" and recognize their exclusive responsibilities, they are often referred to as "vertical" committees. There are 16 such committees:
* Committee on Fats and Oils, hosted by the United Kingdom
* Committee on Fish and Fishery Products, hosted by Norway
* Committee on Milk and Milk Products (formerly the FAO/WHO Committee of Government Experts on the Code of Principles for Milk and Milk Products), hosted by New Zealand
* Committee on Fresh Fruits and Vegetables, hosted by Mexico
* Committee on Cocoa Products and Chocolate, hosted by Switzerland
* Committee on Sugars, hosted by the United Kingdom
* Committee on Processed Fruits and Vegetables, hosted by the United States
* Committee on Vegetable Proteins, hosted by Canada
* Committee on Cereals, Pulses and Legumes, hosted by the United States
* Committee on Processed Meat and Poultry Products, hosted by Denmark
* Committee on Soups and Broths, hosted by Switzerland
* Committee on Meat Hygiene, hosted by New Zealand
* Committee on Natural Mineral Waters, hosted by Switzerland
Commodity Committees convene as necessary and go into recess or are abolished when the Commission decides their work has been completed. New committees may be established on an ad hoc basis to cover specific needs for the development of new standards.
Host countries call meetings of Codex subsidiary bodies at intervals of between one and two years, according to need. Attendance at some Codex committees is almost as large as that drawn by a plenary session of the Commission.
Coordinating Committees have no standing host countries. Meetings are hosted by countries of a region on an ad hoc basis and in agreement with the Commission. There are five Coordinating Committees, i.e. one each for the following regions:
* Africa
* Asia
* Europe
* Latin America and the Caribbean
* North America and Southwest Pacific
Coordinating Committees play an invaluable role in ensuring that the work of the Commission is responsive to regional interests and to the concerns of developing countries. They meet at one- to two-year intervals, with a good representation from the countries of their respective regions. Meeting reports are submitted to and discussed by the Commission.
MEMBER COUNTRIES' ACCEPTANCE OF CODEX STANDARDS
The harmonization of food standards is generally viewed as a prerequisite to the protection of consumer health as well as allowing the fullest possible facilitation of international trade. For that reason, the Uruguay Round Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) both encourage the international harmonization of food standards.
Harmonization can only be achieved when all countries adopt the same standards. The General Principles of the Codex Alimentarius specify the ways in which member countries may "accept" Codex standards. Forms of acceptance vary somewhat depending on whether the standard is a commodity standard, a general standard, or concerns levels for pesticide or veterinary drug residues or food additives. Generally, however, the proposed forms of acceptance are full acceptance, acceptance with minor deviations and free distribution. The ways of acceptance are clearly defined in the General Principles, and their suitability
in the light of experience is subject to review by the Codex Committee on General Principles.
While the growing world interest in all Codex activities clearly indicates global acceptance of the Codex philosophy - embracing harmonization, consumer protection and facilitation of international trade - in practice it is difficult for many countries to accept Codex standards in the statutory sense. Differing legal formats and administrative systems, varying political systems and sometimes the influence of national attitudes and concepts of sovereign rights impede the progress of harmonization and deter the acceptance of Codex standards.
Despite these difficulties, however, the process of harmonization is gaining impetus by virtue of the strong international desire to facilitate trade.
An increasing number of countries are aligning their national food standards, or parts of them (especially those relating to safety), with those of the Codex Alimentarius. This is particularly so in the case of additives, contaminants and residues, i.e. the invisibles.
FAO, WHO AND THE CODEX RELATIONSHIP
FAO and WHO complement the Commission's activities significantly in a number of practical ways. To adopt Codex standards, countries require an adequate food law as well as a technical and administrative infrastructure with the capacity to implement it and ensure compliance. For many years, FAO and WHO have been providing assistance to developing countries to enable them to take full advantage of the Commission's work. This effort has been enhanced to a considerable degree by the financial and technical support received from industrialized countries.
Assistance given to developing countries has included:
* convening expert meetings, including JECFA and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), to advise the Codex Alimentarius Commission;
* establishing and strengthening national food control systems, including the formulation and revision of food legislation (acts and regulations) and food standards in accordance with Codex standards;
* conducting workshops and training courses, not only for transferring information, knowledge and skills associated with food control, but also to increase awareness of the Codex Alimentarius and activities carried out by the Commission.
* strengthening laboratory analysis and food inspection capabilities;
* providing training in all aspects of food control associated with protecting the health of consumers and ensuring honest practices in the sale of food;
* presenting papers at conferences, meetings and symposia on the relevance of Codex activities to the provision of safe food of acceptable quality;
* extending guidance on matters directly related to Codex activities, such as safety assessment of food produced using biotechnology;
* developing and publishing manuals and texts that are associated with food quality control and provide recommendations for the development and operation of food quality and safety systems;
* helping with the establishment and strengthening of food control agencies as well as with training in the necessary technical and administrative skills to ensure their effective operation;
* developing and publishing training manuals on food inspection and quality and safety assurance, particularly with respect to the application of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system in the food-processing industry.

Codex and consumers
COMMITMENT IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS
From their beginnings, FAO and WHO have assisted in the improvement of quality and safety standards applied to food. The highest priority of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, as stated in Article 1 of its statutes, is to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the food trade.
Other UN bodies have also recognized the importance of consumer protection, and in 1985 a UN General Assembly resolution gave rise to the Guidelines for consumer protection, published in 1986. These guidelines identify food as one of three priority areas that are of essential concern to the health of consumers, and the document specifically identifies the Codex Alimentarius as the reference point for consumer protection with regard to food.
Two relevant conferences held early in the 1990s were: the 1991 FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food Trade (held in cooperation with GATT), which recommended continuing and strengthened consumer participation in food-related decision-making at national and international levels; and the 1992 FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition, which recommended that consumers be protected through improved food quality and safety, and outlined measures to accomplish that recommendation.
Furthermore, in 1993, FAO held an expert consultation on the Integration of Consumer Interests in Food Control.
WHAT CODEX HAS PRODUCED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS
Since its inception, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, together with its subsidiary committees, has given top priority to the protection and interests of consumers in the formulation of food standards and related activities.
Food commodity and general standards
Both Codex subsidiary bodies and the Commission give the highest priority to consumer interests in the formulation of commodity and general standards. The adopted format for standards reflects the emphasis that Codex places on ensuring consumers receive products that are of a minimum acceptable quality, are safe and do not present a health hazard. Format provisions for commodity standards, including the name of the standard, its scope, description, weights and measures and labelling, are intended to ensure that the consumer is not misled and to induce confidence that the food item purchased is what the label says it is. The provision covering essential composition and quality factors ensures that the consumer will not receive a product below a minimum acceptable standard. The provisions concerning food additives and contaminants and hygiene are aimed at protecting the health of consumers.
The Codex Alimentarius contains more than 200 standards in the prescribed format for individual foods or groups of foods. In addition, it includes the General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods, the Codex General Guidelines on Claims and the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling, all of which are aimed at ensuring honest practices in the sale of food while also providing guidance to consumers in their choice of products.
Other general standards for food hygiene, food additives, contaminants and toxins in food and for irradiated foods are of pre-eminent importance in protecting consumers' health and they are valued widely for this purpose.
Similarly, maximum residue limits for pesticides and veterinary drugs and maximum limits for food additives and contaminants have been established to ensure that consumers are not exposed
to unsafe levels of hazardous materials.
Extract from the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling
PURPOSE OF THE GUIDELINES
To ensure that nutrition labelling is effective:
"In providing the consumer with information about a food so that a wise choice of food can be made ..."
General principles, guidelines and recommended codes of practice
Instruments such as principles and codes have been developed for the express purpose of protecting the health of consumers against food-borne hazards. For example, general principles have been developed for the use of food additives, food import and export inspection and certification and the addition of essential nutrients to foods.
The Codex Alimentarius contains wide-ranging guidelines for the protection of consumers, including such diverse subjects as the Establishment and Application of Microbiological Criteria for Foods and Levels for Radionuclides in Foods Following Accidental Nuclear Contamination for Use in International Trade.
It also contains codes of practice, most of which are codes of hygienic practice providing guidance on the production of food that is safe and suitable for consumption - in other words, their purpose is to protect the health of consumers. The Recommended International Code of Practice - General Principles of Food Hygiene applies to all foods. It is particularly important in protecting consumers because it lays a firm foundation for food safety and follows the food chain from primary production through to final consumption, highlighting the key hygiene controls required at each stage.
The General Principles of Food Hygiene are supported by detailed codes of hygienic practice that have specific application to:
* low-acid and acidified low-acid canned foods;
* aseptically processed and packaged low-acid foods;
* precooked and cooked foods in mass catering;
* the preparation and sale of street-vended foods (regional standard - Latin America and the Caribbean);
* spices and dried plants;
* canned fruit and vegetable products;
* dried fruits;
* desiccated coconut;
* dehydrated fruits and vegetables including edible fungi;
* tree nuts;
* groundnuts (peanuts);
* processed meat and poultry products;
* poultry processing;
* egg products;
* the processing of frog legs;
* fresh meat;
* the production, storage and composition of mechanically separated meat and poultry meat intended for further processing;
* game;
* the collection, processing and marketing of natural mineral waters.
The Codex Alimentarius also contains the Recommended International Code of Practice for Control of the Use of Veterinary Drugs, which has the express aim of preventing the use of drugs that create a hazard to human health.
There are also a number of so-called codes of technological practice, which are intended to ensure that the processing, transport and storage of foods produced to Codex standards are such that consumers receive end products that are wholesome and of the expected quality. Codes of technological practice exist for:
* foods for infants and children;
* the packaging and transport of fresh fruit and vegetables;
* storage and transport of edible oils and fats in bulk.
Consumers' participation in the work of the Commission and its subsidiary committees
Since its beginning, the Commission has welcomed the participation of consumers, whose organizations have been represented at its sessions since 1965.
The involvement of consumers in the Commission's work has been the subject of explicit discussions within the Commission. Consumers' participation in decision-making in relation to food standards and the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, for instance, was an item on the agenda of the 20th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, where it was agreed that it is necessary to continue working in close cooperation with consumers' organizations.
Because of its international nature, the Commission is aware that it can only go part of the way towards involving consumers in its food standardization and related work. Therefore, the 20th Session of the Commission invited governments to involve consumers more effectively in the decision-making process at the national level:
"The Commission has continued to involve consumer interests in its work while recognizing that it is at the national level that consumers can make their most valuable and effective input."
Information
The Codex Alimentarius Secretariat disseminates Codex documents to international consumers' organizations as well as providing information on request. It also distributes all documents relating both to its own activities and to those of its subsidiary committees to Codex Contact Points in member countries. This is done in the expectation that they will be forwarded to nationally based consumers' organizations for comment as required.
Strengthened food control systems
In helping to establish and strengthen food control systems, FAO and WHO have emphasized the importance of consumers' input and, in some developing countries, have assisted with the establishment of a national consumers' organization.
When assisting with the establishment of National Codex Committees, the two organizations have consistently recommended the inclusion of consumers' representatives and advocated the necessity of receiving their input concerning national attitudes towards proposed international food standards as well as food control activities within the country. In doing this, FAO has recognized the limitations of its authority and the prerogatives and sovereignty of national governments in deciding the extent to which consumers might and can be involved.

Codex and the international food trade
The officials and experts who laid the foundations and determined the direction taken by activities of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme and the Codex Alimentarius Commission were first and foremost concerned with protecting the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in the food trade. They felt that, if all countries harmonized their food laws and adopted internationally agreed standards, such issues would be dealt with naturally. Through harmonization, they envisaged fewer barriers to trade and a freer movement of among countries, which would be to the benefit of farmers and their families and would also help to reduce hunger and poverty. The founders concluded that the Codex Alimentarius would be a panacea to some of the difficulties that were impeding freedom
of trade, a view that is reflected in the General Principles under Purpose of the Codex Alimentarius.
The volume of world food trade is enormous and is valued at between US$300 billion and $400 billion.
A principal concern of national governments is that food imported from other countries should be safe and not jeopardize the health of consumers or pose a threat to the health and safety of their animal and plant populations. Consequently, governments of importing countries have introduced mandatory laws and regulations to eliminate or minimize such threats. In the area of food, animal and plant control, these measures could be conducive to the creation of barriers to inter-country food trade.
The General Principles of the Codex Alimentarius state:
"The publication of the Codex Alimentarius is intended to guide and promote the elaboration and establishment of definitions and requirements for foods to assist in their harmonization and in doing so to facilitate international trade."
THE URUGUAY ROUND AND WORLD FOOD TRADE
The Uruguay Round Agreements represent a milestone in the multilateral trading system because, for the first time, they incorporated agriculture and food under operationally effective rules and disciplines.
Country participants in the round of negotiations recognized that measures ostensibly adopted by national governments to protect the health of their consumers, animals and plants could become disguised barriers to trade as well as being discriminatory. Consequently, the SPS and the TBT Agreements were included among the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods, annexed to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement which established the Word Trade Organization (WTO).
The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures acknowledges that governments have the right to take sanitary and phytosanitary measures necessary for the protection of human health. However, the SPS Agreement requires them to apply those measures only to the extent required to protect human health. It does not permit Member Governments to discriminate by applying different requirements to different countries where the same or similar conditions prevail, unless there is sufficient scientific justification for doing so.
The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade seeks to ensure that technical regulations and standards, including packaging, marking and labelling requirements, and analytical procedures for assessing conformity with technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.
It is noteworthy that the SPS and TBT Agreements both acknowledge the importance of harmonizing standards internationally so as to minimize or eliminate the risk of sanitary, phytosanitary and other technical standards becoming barriers to trade.
In its pursuance of harmonization, with regard to food safety the SPS Agreement has identified and chosen the standards, guidelines and recommendations established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission for food additives, veterinary drug and pesticide residues, contaminants, methods of analysis and sampling, and codes and guidelines of hygienic practice. This means that Codex standards are considered scientifically justified and are accepted as the benchmarks against which national measures and regulations are evaluated.
Considerable interest in the Commission's activities has been stimulated by the specific recognition of Codex standards, guidelines and recommendations within the SPS Agreement as well as the importance assumed by Codex standards in the Technical Regulations and Standards provisions contained in Article 2 of the TBT Agreement. Consequently, attendance at Codex meetings, especially by developing countries, has markedly increased. This is a welcome development, particularly since both Agreements direct members, within the limits of their resources, "to play a full part" in the work of international standards organizations and their subsidiaries.
The adoption of Codex standards as scientifically justified norms for the purpose of the SPS and TBT Agreements is of immense significance. The standards have become an integral part of the legal framework within which international trade is being facilitated through harmonization. Already, they have been used as the benchmark in international trade disputes, and it is expected that they will be used increasingly in this regard.
Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement states:
"Members shall ensure that any sanitary and phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence ..."
Article 3.1 of the SPS Agreement states:
"To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement."
Article 2.6 of the TBT Agreement states:
"With a view to harmonizing technical regulations on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation by appropriate international standardizing bodies of international standards for products for which they have either adopted, or expect to adopt, technical regulations."
CODEX AND THE ETHICS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
The work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission goes beyond creating means of removing barriers to trade. It also includes encouraging food traders to adopt voluntarily ethical practices as an important way of protecting consumers' health and promoting fair practices in the food trade. To this end, the Commission has published the Code of Ethics for International Trade in Food, which is included in the Codex Alimentarius.
A principal objective of the Code of Ethics is to stop exporting countries and exporters from dumping poor-quality or unsafe food on to international markets. The code is currently being updated to reflect the impact of the SPS, the TBT and other agreements on international trade.
Code of Ethics for International Trade in Food
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
4.1 International trade in food should be conducted on the principle that all consumers are entitled to safe, sound and wholesome food and to protection from unfair trade practices.
4.2 No food should be in international trade which:
(a) has in it or upon it any substance in an amount which renders it poisonous, harmful or otherwise injurious to health; or
(b) consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased substance or foreign matter, or is otherwise unfit for human consumption; or
(c) is adulterated; or
(d) is labelled, or presented in a manner that is false, misleading or is deceptive; or
(e) is sold, prepared, packaged, stored or transported for sale under insanitary conditions.
CODEX AND REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS
The Uruguay Round Agreements provide for groups of member countries to enter into trade agreements among themselves for the purpose of liberalizing trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, the United States and Mexico is such an agreement. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay have signed the Treaty of Acunción establishing the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR). In Asia and the Pacific, 18 countries have formalized economic cooperation arrangements under the title, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Council.
All three organizations have adopted measures consistent with principles embraced by the Uruguay Round Agreements and which relate to Codex standards.
NAFTA includes two ancillary agreements dealing with sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade. With regard to SPS measures, Codex standards are cited as basic requirements to be met by the three member countries in terms of the health and safety aspects of food products.
MERCOSUR's Food Commission has recommended a range of Codex standards for adoption by member countries and is using other Codex standards as points of reference in continuing deliberations.
APEC has drafted a Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Conformity Assessment of Foods and Food Products. This calls for consistency with SPS and TBT requirements as well as with Codex standards, including the recommendations of the Codex Committee on Food Import and Export Certification Systems.
In addition, EU directives frequently refer to the Codex Alimentarius as the basis for their requirements.

Codex and science
EXPERT COMMITTEES AND CONSULTATIONS
From the very beginning, the Codex Alimentarius has been a science-based activity. Experts and specialists in a wide range of disciplines have contributed to every aspect of the code to ensure that its standards withstand the most rigorous scientific scrutiny. It is fair to say that the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, together with that of FAO and WHO in their supportive roles, has provided a focal point for food-related scientific research and investigation, and the Commission itself has become an important international medium for the exchange of scientific information about food.
The Codex Alimentarius has stimulated activity in the fields of food chemistry, food technology, food microbiology, mycology, and pesticide and veterinary drug residues. Much work is carried out in the form of collaborative studies between individual scientists, laboratories, institutes and universities and joint FAO/WHO expert committees and consultations.
RECENT EXPERT MEETINGS AND CONSULTATIONS
- FAO/WHO Consultation on Risk Assessment and Food Safety
- Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety
- Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on the Application of Risk Management to Food Safety
- Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on Food Consumption and Exposure Assessment of Chemicals
- Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on the Role of Government Agencies in Assessing HACCP
- Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on the Application of Risk Communication to Food Standards and Safety Matters
The membership of expert consultations is of critical importance. The credibility and acceptability of any conclusions and recommendations depend to a very large degree on the objectiveness, scientific skill and overall competence of the members who formulate them. For this reason, great care is taken in the selection of experts invited to participate. Those selected must be pre-eminent in their speciality, have the highest respect of their scientific peers, and be impartial and indisputably objective in their judgement. They are appointed in their own personal right - not as government representatives or as spokespeople for organizations - and their input is theirs alone. Some experts, especially those on continuing committees, remain members for long periods and thereby develop an invaluable institutional memory.
A large amount of scientifically based food data has been generated by expert meetings, convened and serviced jointly by FAO and WHO.
Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR)
- JMPR was established in 1963 following a decision by FAO Conference that the
Codex Alimentarius Commission should recommend maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticide and environmental contaminants in specific food products to ensure the safety of foods containing residues. It was also decided that JMPR should recommend methods of sampling and analysis.
- JMPR members are eminent independent scientists who are expert in aspects of pesticides, environmental chemicals and their residues and who are appointed in their own right and not as government representatives.
- JMPR is independent of the Commission.
- FAO appointees draft MRLs for substances under evaluation, based on field trials that are conducted worldwide. WHO appointees conduct toxicological evaluations of the pesticides.
- Reports of evaluations are published.
- There is close cooperation between JMPR and the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR). CCPR identifies those substances requiring priority evaluation. After JMPR evaluation, CCPR discusses the recommended MRLs and, if they are acceptable, forwards them to the Commission for adoption as Codex MRLs.
Two such groups, the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, have for many years produced internationally acclaimed data which are widely used by governments, industry and research centres. Their input into the work of the Codex Commission is of fundamental importance and the publications resulting from their activities are acclaimed international references. The evaluations performed by JECFA, like those performed by JMPR, are based on the best scientific information available, comprising inputs from many authoritative sources.
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)
- JECFA was established in 1955 to consider chemical, toxicological and other aspects of contaminants and residues of veterinary drugs in foods for human consumption.
- JECFA members are independent scientists who are expert in aspects of additives, contaminants and veterinary drug residues and who are appointed in their own right and not as government representatives.
- JECFA is independent of the Commission. It provides the Commission and other Codex bodies with expert advice relating to food additives, contaminants and residues of veterinary drugs.
- The Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) and the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCVDF) identify food additives, contaminants and veterinary drug residues that should receive priority evaluation and refer them to JECFA for assessment before incorporating them into Codex standards.
- Reports of toxicological evaluations are published.
- JECFA also provides scientific advice directly to FAO and WHO member countries.
<section>8</section>
Codex administration
The Secretary of the Codex Alimentarius Commission is a senior FAO official who serves as the Chief of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programmes, located within the Food Quality and Standards Service of the Food and Nutrition Division at FAO in Rome.
The Commission's Secretariat comprises six full-time officials based at FAO's Rome headquarters - a surprisingly small number, considering the size and international nature of the Commission's activities.
Commission and executive meetings are administered and serviced entirely by the Rome-based staff. Preparation for these meetings is a formidable task which involves, among a myriad other things, the compilation of agenda item papers and supervision of preparatory work done by others. The preparation of Commission meeting reports is a demanding task in itself, as the report of each meeting must be cleared by participants before its closing. Furthermore, many hours of intense activity are required to ensure that all necessary follow-up is carried out after each meeting.
Many subsidiary committees are hosted, financially maintained and serviced by Member Governments, while the Commission Secretariat coordinates the activities and oversees the operations of those committees. The Secretariat collaborates with subsidiary committee staff in host countries to decide timing and venues for meetings, issue invitations to member countries, finalize agendas and papers, arrange the recording of meeting proceedings as well as the preparation and distribution of meeting reports and ensure that meeting decisions are acted on. There may be as many as 20 Codex committee meetings in any 12-month period.

Codex and the future
It is difficult to imagine a world without the Codex Alimentarius. It has been said that if Codex did not exist, somebody would have to invent it. Consumer demand, recognition by WTO, the growing attendance at Codex meetings and the greater involvement of developing countries all point to a long and active life for the Commission.
However, Codex activities of the future will differ considerably from what they have been until now. Scientific developments in fields relating to food, changing attitudes of consumers, new approaches to food control, changing perceptions of government and food industry responsibilities and changing food quality and safety concepts will present the Commission with new challenges and, conceivably, the need for new standards.
The consumer protection elements of the Codex Alimentarius, which are domain of the "horizontal" committees, are currently gaining in importance, while the compositional or "recipe" elements of individual commodity standards do not appear to attract as much interest as before. At present, interest in the quality aspects of Codex standards remains, although the importance attributed to such issues in the future will depend on community attitudes and demands.
The application of biotechnology to food processing and production of raw food materials is already under scrutiny by the Commission, which is continually examining new concepts and systems associated with food safety and the protection of consumers against health hazards. These topical matters provide some insight into the direction that the Commission's activities are likely to take in the future.
Whatever happens, it would be fair to claim that the Codex Alimentarius' contribution to the betterment of humankind is one of the finer and more extraordinary achievements of the twentieth century.

<title>ADCP/REP/89/39 - A Regional Survey of the Aquaculture Sector in Latin America</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
Aquaculture continues to grow in economic importance. The main reason for this is the quantifiable contribution aquaculture is making in many countries to fill the growing gap between supply and demand for fisheries products. This gap continues to widen because of increasing human populations and the static growth rates of capture fisheries brought about by declines in stocks and the increasing cost of obtaining fish through conventional methods. Although this gap can (and in some cases is already) being met by alternatives, such as inexpensive poultry and white meats, aquaculture particularly provides consumers with a choice of fresh products.
Aquaculture is also evident in earning foreign exchange for many countries through the export of high-value products. It also creates employment, particularly in economically depressed coastal and remote regions, and contributes to the household economy of rural farmers.
This ninth regional survey prepared by the Aquaculture Development and Coordination Programme (ADCP) covers the existing aquaculture sector in the countries of the Latin America region, namely Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
This present survey is not exhaustive. It has been prepared by Pedro Noriega-Curtis (Mexico) and Jose Vera Rivas (Peru) in a relatively brief desk study. They have been helped, however, by the many national aquaculture coordinators and administrators who undertook similar national reviews as pare of preparatory planning studies organized by the Support to the Regional Aquaculture Activities for Latin America and the Caribbean project (AQUILA). This group gathered for a technical meeting on Aquaculture Planning in Caracas, Venezuela, in May 1989. This ADCP review was therefore delayed until this large body of information was assembled, particularly as, for the most part, it had been collected on the sectoral framework prepared by ADCP. The contributions of these aquaculturists through the region are therefore gratefully acknowledged. For some countries of this newly active aquaculture region detailed information is still difficult to obtain. The ADCP apologizes for any
omissions and errors which may exist in the survey, and hopes that these can be corrected in an up-dated survey. New information and notification of changes and errors should be indicated to the ADCP in the Fisheries Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome. The detailed table of contents illustrates the range of information which, hopefully, will be assembled in due course for all regions.
The survey is directed toward administrators, executives, and managers who require broad overviews, rather than for scientists and technologists who require detailed information about species and practices. It is the ninth of a series of regional surveys. To this end, the ADCP hopes that the reader will find the information described here useful.

1.1 Nutritional benefits of fish and shellfish
First and foremost, increasing the per caput consumption of fish and shellfish in any country benefits health. Aquatic animals contain a high level of protein (17-20%), with an amino-acid profile similar to that of meat in ruminants and fowl. The flesh of fish is readily digestible by man. Compared with land animals (with some exceptions, such as shellfish), aquatic animals have a far higher percentage of edible flesh, and there is little wastage. Aquatic animals are a source of minerals, such as calcium, iron, and phosphorus, as well as trace vitamins. Marine species are particularly rich in iodine. The fatty-acid content is high in poly-unsaturated fats, and particularly in those which are attributed to reduce blood cholesterol.
In Latin America fish has an important nutritional role to play in spice of the relatively large supply of red meats; a supply which is higher on a per caput basis than in other third world areas. At the beginning of the 1980s the under-nourished section of the region's population was between 11-16% of the total population. Consequently fish is an integral part of the plans formulated by governments in the region to combat malnutrition.
1.2 Characteristics of consumption in the region
The indigenous populations of Latin America, and the subsequent colonizers, were all eaters of fish but original customs and traditions have all but vanished in view of the large resources of relatively cheap beef produced on the rich grasslands of the continent. The people of the Latin American countries are now some of the highest meat consumers in the world. In 1984 the per caput consumption (in kg/annum) of meat and fish were as follows (from FAO data of world food balance sheets):
Fish
Meat
Fish plus meat (kg/annum)
Argentina
Bolivia
Brazil
Belize
Chile
Colombia
Costa Rica
Ecuador
El Salvador
French Guiana
Guatemala
Guyana
Honduras
Mexico
Nicaragua
Panama
Paraguay
Peru
Suriname
Uruguay
Venezuela
Several countries have attempted to stimulate the consumption of fish but the results have been mixed. Frequently it has proved to be difficult to change the habits and reduce the consumption of red meat in favour of fish.
The share of fish in the per caput consumption of animal proteins (grams/person/day) has remained stable during the period 1970 to 1984, and fish still accounts for about 8% of animal protein consumption. On the other hand animal protein from poultry (mostly chicken) has increased its share from about 7-10%.
In the region as a whole fish consumption remains low, about two-thirds that of the world average. The reasons are several. Fish resources are abundant but they are mostly exploited by industrialized fishing for reduction to fish meal, and the high-value shellfish, both crustaceans and molluscs, either fresh or frozen, are exported to earn foreign exchange.
1.3 Annual consumption of fish and shellfish
In recent years the production of fish for human consumption has increased (that is, the share delivered for reduction has decreased) but the rate of increase has not been sufficient to satisfy nutritional needs in the region. The reasons are mainly twofold: (a) fish for human consumption is exported, and (b) modern industrial fisheries do not supply fish at a cost low enough to come within the economic reach of the urban and rural poor.
Although the per caput consumption of fish for the region of Latin America is low, this average figure hides considerable differences within the region. For example, (see 1.2) countries in Central America (Guatemala and Honduras) report annual per caput fish consumption as low as 1 kg, and the Pacific countries of South America (Ecuador, Peru, and Chile) as high as 14-20 kg.
These same countries of South America dominate the fishing industry in the region as described. The nominal catch for the region as a whole for 1986 (FAO, 1987) was over 13.5 million tonnes (t). This included all marine and freshwater fish, molluscs, and crustaceans. Leading countries with over 4.5 million t were Chile, followed by Peru. Mexico has increased its catch to over 1.4 million t, while Ecuador has decreased its catch from 1.0 million t in 1986 to under 0.7 million t in 1987. Brazil produced almost 0.8 million t and Argentina above 0.5 million t. These six countries accounted for 94% of the regional catch, the bulk of which is the pelagic species which are reduced to fish meal. With the exception of Panama, Uruguay, and Venezuela, the remaining coastal countries contributed much below 100 000 t each, and land-locked Paraguay and Bolivia had 10 000 and 5 000 t respectively.
Of the regional catch almost 2.8 million t (20%) were exported, with a value of US$ 2 900 million. Individual countries differed in export earnings relative to gross export volume depending on their specific product range. Chile was the leading exporting country with 1.3 million t (value US$ 635 million), followed by Peru (757 000 t and US$ 290 million), Argentina (235 000 t, US$ 262 million), Ecuador (200 000 t and US$ 481 million), and Mexico (127 553 t, US$ 570 million). Brazil, Panama, Uruguay, and Venezuela exported below 50 000 t but above 20 000 t (value US$ 178-25 million). All other countries exported below 10 000 t (value US$ 44-5 million).
The main imports of fisheries products to the countries of the region are fish oil, fish fillets, canned fish, canned salmon, frozen fish, etc., for consumption. The total imports to the region are about 267 000 t, with a value of over US$ 240 million. The main importers as of 1987 were as follows:

Total
The region as a whole is a net exporter of fisheries products as it exports over 2.8 million t, while imports amount to less than 0.3 million t. Fisheries are also a net generator of foreign exchange, with earnings exceeding US$ 2 500 million annually.
Data available on the exportation and importation of aquaculture products are rather scarce. So far aquaculture products are not separated in FAO fisheries data and INFOPESCA is only starting to reflect this differentiation in its marketing reports. However, some individual figures for certain countries of the region are known: for example, Chile exported in 1987 5 683 t of aquacultural produce worth US$ 26.6 million which included mainly trout and salmon (1 854 t, US$ 7.18 million) and dried seaweeds and agar-agar (2 724 t and 873 t respectively, with a total value of US$ 17.4 million). Ecuador exported 44 000 t of shrimp tails worth US$ 500 million, followed by Peru (2 036 t, US$ 22.5 million).
The USA is the major importer of aquaculture products exported by most Latin American countries, although Chile exports considerable amounts of salmonids to Japan, Canada, and Northern European countries.
1.4 Gross market data
In 1987 the total population of the twenty-one countries of the region as described was over 387 million (Population Division of the United Nations (UN), New York). In summary, the countries of Belize, French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana have populations below 1 million. Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay in South America, and Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua in Central America have populations of 1.0-10 million people; Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela have 11.0-35.0 million; Brazil (141.3 million), and Mexico (82.86 million) are the most populated. The population growth in all countries is reasonably consistent at 2-3% per annum, but highest in French Guiana (3.9%), Honduras (3.5%), Venezuela (3.3%), Nicaragua (3.1%), and El Salvador (3.0%).
The economic wealth in the region is consistently more concentrated than the population. There are only two countries with Gross National Products (GNP) over US$ 100 thousand million (Brazil and Mexico), and only two countries between US$ 50-100 thousand million (Argentina and Venezuela). There are four countries between 10-50 thousand million (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), and all the rest have a GNP below US$ 10 thousand million, with the exception of Belize which is only US$ 180 million.
The GNP per caput (1985) differs greatly from country to country. In increasing order, Bolivia (US$ 470), Guyana (US$ 570), El Salvador (US$ 710), Honduras (US$ 730), Nicaragua (US$ 850), Paraguay (US$ 940), and Peru (US$ 960) it is below US$ 1 000 per caput; in Belize (US$ 1 130), Ecuador (US$ 1 160), Guatemala (US$ 1 240), Colombia (US$ 1 320), Chile (US$ 1 440), Uruguay (US$ 1 660), and Brazil (US$ 1640) it is US$ 1 000-2 000; in Panama (US$ 2 020), Mexico (US$ 2 080), Argentina (US$ 2 130), and Suriname (US$ 2 570) it is over US$ 2 000; and only in Venezuela (US$ 3 110) is it over US$ 3 000. No data are available for French Guiana.
1.5 Specific market data
Three features stand out in the production, marketing/distribution, and consumption of fish products within the region:
(a) 72% of the total catch is not utilized for direct human consumption.
(b) Exports amount to 7.5% of the total catch but are worth over 50% of the total value of all fish landings.
(c) Imports amount to only 6.5% of the total food supply available for direct human consumption and consist mainly of preserved sardines and tuna.
Traditionally fish consumption in the region had been generally low. This was attributed to the following reasons: feeding habits of the local population do not include fish; the lack of adequate preservation methods usually rendered poor quality products; high prices of fish compared with most other meat products; inconsistent supplies, etc. In addition to the above, the undeveloped state of fish markets in rural areas influenced consumption patterns amongst the local population shifting their preferences toward readily available products, mainly preserved sardines and tuna fish.
Sardines and tuna products became staple elements in the diets of the poorer segments of the population throughout Latin America, regardless of whether they were produced internally or were imported from abroad. However, during the past decade the price of these products has shown a considerable increase due to the increasing exchange rates of most local currencies in relation to the US dollar. In addition to this, the diminishing purchasing power of the rural poor has resulted in a decline in the consumption of these fish products.
In order to overcome this situation, governments have been forced to promote the consumption of fresh fish and have therefore created national processing and distribution networks as a means to supply and regulate local sales of fish in the more remote and isolated provincial areas. But because these schemes involve substantial subsidies, their operation is often hindered by national budgetary constraints. Other problems faced by these distribution networks stem from their uneven capacity to concentrate and handle produce due to the lack of sufficient infrastructure (public services, roads, water, ice factories, refrigerated store-rooms, etc.). The geographical dispersion of the rural population centres and the lack of coordination and integration among producers (fishermen), processors, merchants, distribution centres, wholesalers, retailers, etc., do not facilitate the proper marketing of fish and fish products. In many instances an excessive intermediarism contributes to
the great disparity between buying prices paid to producers and selling prices paid by the final consumer.
Prices of fish within the region, contrary to popular belief, are not lower than those of other meat and poultry products. Thus, unless attention is given to this matter, demand for fish will not increase substantially. In order to render fish products competitive, adequate levels of technology for their production, processing, and distribution are required.
Attempts to promote fish have, in some countries, been combined with attempts to develop fish technologies appropriate for preserving and handling locally occurring species (particularly small pelagics) to make them popular on local markets. Some success in this direction has been achieved in Mexico and Peru. Most of the cured and canned fish now produced in the region are consumed within the continent but quantities involved are relatively small.
Both fresh and chilled/frozen fish are the principal products supplied to consumers in Latin America. However, as the infrastructure needed to transport and store these products is not generally available in most countries, the supplies of fish are concentrated in major cities and coastal industrial fishing centres. For instance, in Costa Rica 84% of the urban population consumes fish but only 60% of the rural population. The differences in consumption between urban and rural populations are attributed more to the availability and distribution capabilities of fish products rather than to eating habits, since in fact rural populations consume as much canned fish products as do the urban populations.
On the other hand, it is well recognized that in most countries of Latin America both the fisheries sector and the aquaculture sub-sector are only marginal within the national economies. As such, export markets for most of the countries of the region are closely linked to the US market and are consequently affected by changes in the major international fish markets. Price fixation is also influenced by major fishing countries operating within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the countries of the region. Argentina seems particularly affected in its export revenues by the fluctuation in the composition of its catches, unlike other countries with more stable and consistent landings, e.g. Chile, Mexico, etc. The European Economic Community (EEC) maintains certain barriers which hinder the importation of fish products from Latin American countries.
Chile and Argentina present a wider diversification in their exportation of fish products (preserved, salted, cured, etc.) while most other countries export mainly frozen products (shrimp tails, lobster, fish fillets). Chile is also a major exporter of fish meal, agar-agar, and molluscs. Brazil is the main supplier of catfish to the USA, and although at present exports are based on wild-caught resources there is potential for the expansion of the cultivation of this fish.
Colombia is the only country of the region which shows a negative trade balance in its fish commerce, this in spite of the fact that live ornamental fish are included in its export values. In addition, the development of its fishery sector faced a serious setback when the government removed trade barriers to fish products from Ecuador, Peru, and Chile due to the deleterious effects which this action produced on the vertical and/or horizontal integration of the production, processing, and marketing of fish. Only in the case of trout such elimination of barriers proved positive as new internal markets opened to the local aquaculture industry.
The main international markets of aquaculture products from the region are as follows:
Shrimp. The USA is the main importer of penaeid shrimp from Latin America, traditionally supplied by Mexican capture fisheries, but more recently also by cultured shrimp from Ecuador (over 45 000 t). Attention should be paid to the fact that Asia is very aggressively entering the North American market with lower priced products, although it is foreseen that higher quality shrimp will also be supplied in the near future. Although the Japanese market does not consume shrimp from Latin America in significant amounts, it does exert an indirect effect through its influence on the quantities and prices in the North American market. The European market continues to be very limited for Latin American products even though trends appear to be changing gradually with respect to its preferences.
Catfish. The USA imports over 6 000 t of catfish, mostly from Brazil, as well as small quantities of black catfish (Rhamdia sapo) from Uruguay and Argentina, and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) from Mexico. It is therefore conceivable that in the future these and other Latin American countries may supply larger amounts, provided the products meet quality specifications and that shipments are made regularly.
Tilapia. Potentially the USA may also become a major importer of this fish (mainly in fillets), as has been shown recently by the increasing demand for this product not only for its local ethnic markets but for the public in general. Costa Rica and several Caribbean countries are already exporting tilapia products to this expanding North American market.
Prawns. Although somewhat controversial, it now appears that freshwater prawns are gradually gaining wider acceptance in the USA markets as well as in various Southern European countries.
Trout. Although trout is a major commodity in the fish trade, it is generally recognized that Latin American production of trout is unlikely to compete in price with the efficient production systems in North America and Europe. Chile is perhaps the only exception due to the fact that trout is raised in sea cages.
Salmon. Of all the countries of the region, only Chile produces this fish and has now become the third producer in the world of Pacific salmon. Its excellent quality commands an f.o.b. price of US$ 4.70/kg.
Some countries (e.g. Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru) recognize the existence of illegal trade of fishery products caused mainly by price differentials which make it attractive either to introduce them illegally into another country, or simply to market them through unofficial channels to avoid payment of taxes and tariffs. In some instances the illegal trade arises from restrictions imposed on certain sectors banning their participation in fishery-related activities.
Some countries of the region have established fiscal incentives favouring the export of fish products, such as tax deductions of up to 15%, and elimination of tariffs for importation of raw materials and other inputs used in the production of the final products. For instance, Costa Rica imports fresh/frozen tuna and sardines to supply its canning industry and later re-exports these processed products.
On the other hand, the ever increasing price of imports in terms of local currencies acts as a deterrent to further imports and thus the opportunity arises for aquaculture to participate in filling this internal market niche. This situation is clearly recognized by Central American countries, whose overall internal fish consumption had depended to a great extent on the importation of canned fish, which are now attempting to enhance aquaculture.
Based on a comprehensive regional study aimed at assessing the present status of aquaculture development, AQUILA has compiled data estimating the value of aquaculture products both sold domestically and exported. Accordingly, the total estimated value of aquaculture production in the region amounts to some US$ 900 million, of which over 90% corresponds to export sales (mainly based on marine shrimp), while less than 10% is marketed domestically. (These data do not consider oyster production in Mexico worth approximately US$ 20 million.)
1.6 Information for the trade
There is little information to be found on aquaculture trade, in the region. The principal marketing information service is INFOPESCA, although it does not differentiate aquaculture products as yet. INFOPESCA assists the fishing industry and governments in the region by establishing contacts between buyers and sellers of fish products, and providing technical information and advice on post-harvest aspects of fisheries, such as handling, processing, equipment selection, and quality assurance. INFOPESCA is based in Panama City, in Panama, and its working languages are Spanish and English.
INFOPESCA is one of four regional services (in Africa, Arab countries, and Asia). This network of services produces a fortnightly news bulletin called "Trade News" in English, French, Spanish and Arabic. This deals with prices, cold storage holdings, short-term market trends, and business opportunities. The network also publishes a two-monthly magazine called "INFOFISH International" (ex-Marketing Digest) in English, which contains articles on market analysis, new products, processing, packaging, equipment, and other aspects of fisheries, including aquaculture, with summaries in the other three languages. Again, as yet, little information is relevant to aquaculture in the region.
A fifth member of the service is the FAO computerized system of fish marketing called "GLOBEFISH". This database stores original information collected by INFOPESCA and the other regional services on such aspects as production and trade statistics, price series, the supply and demand situation, information on aquaculture, investment, joint ventures, and general economic data relevant to fisheries. Specific searches are made on request. FAO also produces "Globefish Highlights", which is a quarterly analysis of medium trends. It is based on the information in the data bank and is distributed in four languages as a supplement to "Trade News".
Annual fishery statistics are also stored on an FAO database called FISHDAB. As yet aquaculture statistics are not separated.
Regarding international market quotations for aquaculture products, the Commercial Fishing Information System handled by INFOPESCA processes and distributes through its reports the prices of some cultured species, in addition to specifying their presentation and preservation forms, the type of market, and the origin of the products. At present, quotations for cultured shrimps, tilapia, common and Chinese carps, eel, salmon, trout, catfish, and seaweeds are occasionally published.
This same system offers technical and commercial assistance in marketing operations with the aim of placing traditional products at better price levels, as well as introducing and maintaining new products until they establish a position in international markets.
The National Marine Fisheries Service of the US Department of Commerce publishes a Fishery Market News Report three times per week containing information on primary wholesale selling prices for shrimp and fish and other selected wholesale frozen fishery products in the principal fish markets of New York, Boston, Portland, etc. It also gives information on imports entered into the New York Customs District and provides additional services such as listings of available trade opportunities, and various reports of the fishing industry.
This Fishery Market News Report is relevant to the aquaculture industry of the region as it provides an indication of prices for shrimp from Ecuador - the leading producer of cultured shrimp in Latin America.
Reports on the fisheries of Latin American countries are prepared occasionally by the US Department of State, Foreign Commercial Service, and the National Marine Fisheries Service. These reports usually include aspects on the production and trade of aquaculture products.
"Shrimp Notes", published by Shrimp World Inc. of the USA, is a monthly market news analysis and is an important source of information on shrimp market conditions. It sometimes includes comments on the shrimp culture industry of Latin America and provides information on US cold storage holdings of shrimp, US market situations, production, imports, and outlook.
The LMR Shrimp Market Report is a monthly publication which analyses and reports on current and prospective trends in the international shrimp market, including production, imports, demand, and current prices. Developments in the major producing (fishing and aquaculture) countries are reported as information becomes available.
The Erkins Seafood Letter, published in the USA, is a monthly market analysis and opinion on the seafood industry of the US which is the main importer of fishery products for Latin America. It provides quotations on importer/wholesaler fishery prices.
As Japan also imports shrimp from various Latin American countries (but on a minor scale), the Japanese Shrimp Market Report could become a relevant source of information for the trade in the future.
The major importer of Mexican shrimp, Ocean Garden Products, Inc., publishes a report on current prices of major shrimp and fish commodities in the US market. Complementary information on the fishing and aquaculture industries and trade covered in this report may also prove of value to the sub-sector.
As most of the high-value products are exported out of the region (and fish meal is the most important to the animal feeds industry) other marketing resources on the periphery are important. Eurofish Report (UK) is a two-weekly publication reviewing European and world fishing, with comprehensive coverage of EEC fisheries legislation and the Common Fishery Policy. It contains considerable reference to activities in aquaculture, including supplies and prices of commodities, including fish meal. The Japanese External Trade Organization publishes marketing reports and disseminates them to its offices outside Japan. They reach the trade after many weeks. The Japanese Marine Products Importer Association produces a monthly leaflet.
Many international markets are covered by "Seafood Business" (USA), "Seafood International" (UK), and "Il Pesce" (Italy). All these commercial publications are available through subscription and, in addition to prices and market trends, they contain relevant articles on aquaculture production world-wide.
In almost every country in the region there are specialized institutions with information on export products. In Chile, for example, the ProChile organization produces literature and provides information through publications of the export/import trade in fisheries products, and has particularly assisted the international marketing of salmon and shellfish.
1.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
As in most of the other regions, marketing is invariably a component omitted from technical assistance projects and therefore there are few in the region at this level of the sector.
The most important project is INFOPESCA - a marketing and advisory service specializing in Latin American and Caribbean fisheries. INFOPESCA is part of a network of marketing services established by FAO in four regions (see 1.6). This regional service is financed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Panama, the host country, provides office facilities and some support staff.
A number of independent marketing studies have been carried out on specific species, often in advance of pending projects. For example, the Comité Andino de Fomento (CAF) has supported a marketing study on cultured trout; and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has carried out shrimp marketing studies in association with its lending programme in Ecuador. Fundación Chile and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have carried out studies on the marketing of cultured salmon for projects in Chile.
AQUILA, funded by the Government of Italy, has been conducting training, research, and information activities in 19 countries of the region. Recognizing that marketing is a key element for the development of the aquaculture industry, this subject has been included in the curricula of the annual Basic Course on Planning and Management of Aquaculture sponsored by AQUILA. Additionally, the topic of marketing of aquaculture products is also covered in a research project entitled "Profile of Economic Aspects of Aquaculture" implemented by the project.
Two other related activities envisaged under the scope of AQUILA are (i) a course on Post-Harvest Technology for the handling, processing, and preservation of aquaculture products, and (ii) a study on the market potentialities of the seaweed Gracilaria to devise an appropriate strategy for cultivation and marketing throughout the region.
The state of aquaculture in Latin America has been included in a world-wide shrimp study by INFOFISH on contract with the Asian Development Bank. The study is to reveal common trends in consumption and production, the impact of aquaculture operations on price development, and the role of developing countries in shrimp supply.

2.6 Financial investment by public and private enterprises
2.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
2.8 Capital assistance projects in the sub-sector
2.1 Characteristics of production
The region as described includes the thirteen countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela) and eight of Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama). This vast region extends from 30°N to almost 60°S and includes every climatic environment from equatorial to almost polar. The geographic environments include a wide range of aquatic resources; inland these include vast watersheds of large rivers, and many artificial and natural water bodies including hiding high mountain lakes; coastally these include long flat tropical beaches, mangrove swamps, and inaccessible fjords and islands. Together with its wide range of aquatic species suitable for culture, the region has all the geographical and biological elements for significant aquaculture potential.
The main objectives and goals set by governments in their efforts to foster aquaculture development have been:
- production of inexpensive sources of protein for local consumption;
- production of fishery products to supply domestic markets;
- creation of employment opportunities and promotion of rural development;
- generation of foreign currency revenue.
Accordingly, culture has either been directed toward more intensive fish production systems to supply high-value products to either local markets or for direct export, or for stocking artificial and natural impoundments for local markets.
Although the region had indigenous salmonid species, North American and European expatriates in the last hundred years introduced a variety of salmonids to the countries of the temperate latitudes (Argentina and Chile) and high altitudes (Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru) where water conditions were appropriate. Small hatcheries were built to support the demands of sports fishing and local markets. These countries still produce salmonids, and the interest has increased significantly, particularly in Chile with the re-introduction of the Atlantic and Pacific salmon for both coastal cage farming and ocean ranching in the south of the country.
Semi-intensive farming of marine shrimp in Costa Rica and Panama, and in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, and more recently in Mexico and other Central American countries, which has only developed in the last two decades, was possible originally because of the extensive nurseries for juveniles along the beaches of the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines of Mexico, Central America, and equatorial South America. These resources were used for stocking coastal tidal ponds, but reliance on them has slowly been replaced by hatchery-reared juveniles of introduced species (including freshwater prawns). Recently hatcheries have also enabled development of non-coastal brackishwater areas with ponds and pumped water. The scale of operation of these highly commercial farms requires large tracts of flat land, and therefore investment has been confined to existing land-owners, or companies which have been able to buy private land or to obtain government land for development at concessionary
rates.
At the other end of the scale, some forms of extensive fish culture have been traditional in the rural areas of almost every country in the region, but particularly the countries of Mexico and Central America. Both indigenous species (the cichlids and colossomids) and introduced species (tilapias and carps) have been used. Until recently much of this was simple pond management with few inputs, but with the introduction of hatchery technologies stocking programmes organized by national and local governments in natural and man-made water bodies have enabled culture-based fisheries to be established, notably in Brazil and Mexico, both with warmwater species (tilapia and carps) and with cold water species (mainly trout and silverside) in Peru and Bolivia in Lake Titicaca.
The development of cage culture in these and other water bodies also offers potential for increased fish production, but because this system generally involves higher levels of management (including feeding practices), economic, technological, and cultural factors often preclude individual farmers/fishermen from participating in such production systems.
2.2 Regional production data
Although statistics do not clearly differentiate aquaculture production from inland fisheries, it can be appreciated that most Latin American countries have made great strides in increasing production of aquatic organisms in recent years.
The specific breakdown by country and commodity group of aquaculture production as defined by FAO, i.e. excluding resources whose ownership is undefined until the time of their harvest, is shown in the following table.
About 18% of regional aquaculture production is finfish (mainly tilapia, carps and native species), 39% is molluscs (mainly oysters and mussels), 38% is shrimp (penaeid species), and 5% is seaweed (only produced by Chile). Production of both molluscs and shrimp has increased since 1986, shrimp production having reached over 70 000 t in 1988 accounting for 20-25% of global production of cultured shrimp.
Commercial aquaculture, in its choice of species and markets, has been influenced by the industrial export-oriented fisheries. Although the production of marine shrimps, salmonids, and algae represents almost 50% of the volume of aquaculture production (1986), its share of commercial value is much larger, and probably accounts for more than 80% of the ex-farm value.
Almost all shrimps and algae produced through culture are exported. This is not true for molluscs or finfish, as only high-value salmon and rainbow trout, and some mussels and oysters are exported. In 1987 about 2 000 t of the two former species of fish were exported, equivalent to about 10% of the volume of finfish produced through culture but only 1% of the total culture-based fisheries. Small quantities of cultured freshwater shrimp and seaweeds were also exported, mainly to Europe and North America. Intraregional trade in aquaculture products (mostly trout) is small.

* Estimated
High value species, such as trout, catfish, freshwater prawns, and molluscs, are marketed within the national restaurant and tourist industries, while the more popular fish species which make up regional production (predominantly tilapia, carps, and colossoma) are consumed locally, typically at source or in the larger urban centres.
Except for the registered and licensed commercial operations, total surface areas under cultivation are difficult to estimate. Great variations in yield per unit surface area are recorded for any given species even under similar conditions or levels of technology employed, and sizes of farming units also vary widely. Even so, it has been reported that some countries have developed considerable surface areas of cultivation, such as Ecuador where over 110 000 ha are utilized for the production of shrimp and only 600 ha for finfish culture. Panama has some 82 ha of freshwater ponds and some 5 000 ha for shrimp culture. In Colombia cultivation in freshwater under extensive and intensive systems occupies about 1 000 ha, while 2 000 ha have been developed for coastal aquaculture (shrimp). El Salvador reports the existence of 300 ha devoted to shrimp culture, mostly under extensive cultivation and without the support of local hatcheries. In Guatemala freshwater ponds do not exceed
100 ha, which is less than 10% of the total surface dedicated to shrimp production. Some additional 26 ha produce freshwater prawns for domestic consumption. In Honduras the contrast between freshwater (41 ha) and marine (4 000 ha) is even greater.
In Mexico the total surface area of freshwater aquaculture is 10 000 ha, only slightly greater than that of marine shrimp culture. This proportion will soon revert itself as shrimp culture ponds continue to be built at an ever faster rate.
Peru has made more progress in shrimp farming and has now over 3 000 ha of ponds but only 35 ha of freshwater ponds. Other countries in the region generally report considerably less than 1 000 ha under culture for both marine and freshwater species.
On the other hand, culture-based fisheries occupy extensive areas as these usually involve natural or man-made water bodies or large river basins. The range of the former vary from relatively small barrages and lakes such as Lake Poopo in Bolivia (250 ha), to large dams and lakes sometimes over 10 000 ha (e.g. Lake Titicaca in Peru-Bolivia, and Lake Patzcuaro and the dams of Infiernillo and Temazcal in Mexico). These water bodies also sustain cage or pen-based intensive commercial operations in which only a minor proportion of the total surface area is actually occupied by culture facilities.
At the other end of the scale, most of the aquaculture production in Chile is derived from the marine environment where surface areas are virtually irrelevant. Such is the case of mussel production in Argentina and Peru, and of oysters in Mexico where over 40 000 t are produced annually.
2.3 Production systems and practices
Pond culture: The predominant system of aquaculture production in the region is extensive farming in small shallow ponds. A number of indigenous species have been cultured traditionally, such as Cichla ocellaris (in Panama), Colossoma bidens and Mylossoma bidens (in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela), Pimelodus spp., Prochilodus spp. (in Colombia), and Mugil spp. (in Brazil). These species have a variety of natural diets which has dictated specific practices. C. ocellaris, for example, is a predator and is often reared in polyculture with Tilapia spp. on which it feeds. C. bidens is a filter feeder and also eats small crustaceans, insects, and fruits. M. bidens eats mostly fruits. The many species of catfishes, Pimelodus spp., are mostly omnivorous, as are the Prochilodus and Mugil spp. Because of the feeding habits of these species, most of the culture practices are dependent on pond productivity which is enhanced by fertilization, usually organic wastes, and often
involve polyculture.
Most farming practices rely on the collection of juveniles from natural resources to supplement the juveniles produced in the ponds from captive populations. However, the availability of all resources is low, which has constrained the elevation of production into semi-intensive systems. Resources which are available in large numbers are often used for stocking lakes and reservoirs, as is the case with the silverside (Odonthesthes bonairenses) in Peru. Mugil spp. are usually raised in coastal brackishwater ponds (Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela).
Five tilapia species (T. mossambica, T. rendalli, O. niloticus, O. aureus, and S. hornorum) have been introduced into the region and stocked in ponds, in large water bodies, and even released into open watersheds. Tilapia are now farmed in some form in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Paraguay. Similarly the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) has been introduced and is now farmed in Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay. These warmwater species have all adapted well to these countries, not only to the climatic conditions but also to the range of natural foods available to them. The management practices for production are relatively simple and the level of extensive farming can be conveniently accommodated to the economies of each particular locale. The two Chinese carps, bighead (Aristichthys nobilis) and silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have also
been introduced into Honduras, and other countries such as Costa Rica and Mexico, and are often raised in ponds in polyculture with the common carp and tilapia species.
These introduced species constitute the main component of some of the most important culture-based fisheries in the region, exceeding over 100 000 t per year. Although non-traditional fish consumers, many communities in Latin America have virtually adopted these species as part of their staple fish diet.
Marine shrimps (Penaeus spp.) are the most important species farmed in coastal brackishwater ponds and the areas under production are increasing each year. In 1987, for example, production in Ecuador reached almost 70 000 t, while Panama and Peru are approaching a production of 4 000 t each. Several other countries of the region have just about doubled their production albeit still small in volume. Cultured production in Ecuador is now greater than the natural harvest of shrimp. Extensive coastal lands and lagoons have been developed, and mangrove swamps reclaimed for pond construction.
Latin America is a leading world producer of cultured shrimp, having harvested over 80 000 t in 1988. Although 85% is being produced by Ecuador, the industry is rapidly growing in other countries. By 1988 Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Peru were reporting harvests in excess of 1 000 t. Although the Latin American shrimp culture industry lags behind that of Asia, its share of the total world harvest may increase significantly to levels above 20% as several important potential producers expand their production. Recent developments in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia confirm the former and will have an especially important impact on the industry's future.
Raceway culture: Traditional farming of salmonids has centred on rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), which readily acclimated to the cool waters of the temperate zones and high mountains. Although mostly released into natural water bodies for sports fishing, a number of land-based freshwater farms have been constructed using high water exchange rates (raceways) and relying on artificial feeding. Farmed production is now recorded in Argentina (460 t), Chile (2 384 t), Colombia (400 t), Costa Rica (25 t), Mexico (425 t), Peru (471 t), and Venezuela (315 t).
The channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) has also been cultured in raceways wherever gravity-fed warm waters are abundantly available. In Mexico over 200 t are produced in such systems.
Cage culture: The salmonids have readily adapted to other intensive systems, particularly farming in floating cages. Rainbow trout adapted to saltwater are now cultured by such practices, and two species of Pacific salmon, the silver or coho (Onchorhynchus kisutch) and king or spring (O. tyshawytscha). Recently the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has been reintroduced for cage farming. All cage culture of these salmon species is practised in Chile, but further attempts are being made in Argentina and the Falkland Islands.
Cage culture of several tilapia species is practised in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador in natural water bodies and reservoirs. The fish do better in terms of increased growth rate if provided with supplemental feeds but many locations have a natural productivity which can sustain reasonable densities.
Ocean ranching: The oceanic waters of the Southern Ocean are rich in natural resources of planktonic organisms ideal for migratory salmonids. For several years Chile has developed an ocean ranching programme with Pacific salmon. The first returns are mostly being used to build up increased annual releases.
Off-bottom and on-bottom culture of molluscs: The majority of molluscs are produced off-bottom, suspended from floating rafts or longlines. Others are managed on tidal beds. The species of importance produced in the region are the American cupped oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which is cultured in Mexico, and the Pacific cupped oyster, C. gigas, and Chilean flat oyster, Ostrea chilensis, in Chile. Brazil produces C. braziliana. The Chilean mussel, Mytilus chilensis, and choro mussel, Choromytilus chorus, are farmed in Chile; the blue mussel, M. edulis, and M. platensis in Argentina; the rock mussel, P. perna, in Venezuela. Some scallops (Pectenid spp.) are produced in Peru and Chile. Small farms are in operation for abalones (Haliotis spp.) in Mexico and Chile but production is not yet significant. Only Costa Rica reports significant production of freshwater molluscs (15 t/year).
Coastal farming of algae: Within the region Chile is the only important producer of marine algae (Gracilaria spp.), having produced over 9 000 t through the propagation, management, and harvesting of natural beds.
2.4 Producers in the region
Producers in the region can be classified into four principal groups: the corporate or industrial producers; private farmers (usually owner operators of small farms, complementary to other agricultural activities), rural farmers (non-commercial, subsistence family-based land and households with scarce resources); and artisanal fishermen who benefit from aquaculture through government operated culture-based fisheries.
In most countries the large privately-owned companies dominate the export-oriented production for crustaceans and molluscs. With the exception of Mexico, where only cooperatives are permitted by law to engage in the cultivation of shrimps and oysters, shrimp farming in general has attracted considerable national and international investment. Multinational corporations have set up shrimp farms in Belize, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. In many cases these farms are vertically integrated, thus becoming direct exporters.
In Chile most production of salmonids is undertaken by corporate producers, although some cooperatives also participate in this activity. In Argentina 80% of the 460 t of trout are produced by only four commercial units, while the remaining 20% are produced by some 20 smaller units.
In the Latin American countries aquaculture production is distributed over a large number of producers. In Ecuador there are some 1 200 shrimp producers. In 1985 in Chile there were 18 enterprises producing chorito in the southern region, employing about 1 000 workers. Further north another 14 produce chorito and choro. About 9 enterprises produce oysters, and 3 scallops. There are 19 farms involved in salmonid production; six private companies produce salmon in the Chiloe region, and two companies dominate trout production. In the country the harvesting and management of the coastal resources of algae (Gracilaria spp.) employ the largest number of people. About 11 000 are employed in the industry, of whom about 8 500 work on Gracilaria.
In Peru there are about 120 private shrimp producers, and about 30 freshwater fish farms. There are some 93 enterprises associated with shellfish production. The production of trout fry is the responsibility of 22 public stations.
Most owner-operators with small farms produce freshwater prawns and finfish (particularly the higher valued species such as trout, catfish, some tilapias, such as red hybrids, and lately, but to a much smaller extent, with colossoma). These farmers in general are directly involved in marketing their products, as neither marketing associations nor middlemen dedicated specifically to this trade, exist. The main customers of these "luxury" species are the restaurants and hotels, and supermarkets, generally located either in the larger urban centres or in tourist resorts. Smaller amounts are sometimes also channelled to local market places.
The rural subsistence farmers and culture-based fishermen produce tilapia, carps, and other native species. In the former case, the fish is consumed within the same household, while in the latter the fish are usually marketed through intermediaries and other conventional channels.
The culture-based fisheries for tilapia in Brazil and Mexico involve many fishermen. In North-Eastern Brazil some 10 000 fishermen catch fish in 102 reservoirs and temporary barrages. In Mexico over 145 communities of fishermen depend on culture-based fisheries in continental waters for their living. In addition there are about 1 700 registered private and public production units for freshwater species, mostly trout, catfish, tilapia and carps, of which 66 operate intensive systems while the rest are semi-intensive and extensive operations. In total, over 64 000 persons work directly in the aquaculture sector of this country.
2.5 Organizations of producers
In some instances culture-based fish production has increased substantially as a result of the organization of fishermen into cooperatives. For instance, in one lake of Bolivia, pejerrey catches increased by 388% in a period of five years. In Panama the Instituto Panameño de Cooperativas has organized several communities surrounding Lake Gatun into fishing cooperatives catching over 50 t of both native and introduced species, and several other cooperatives have been formed around various lakes and dams of the country (such as Yeguada, Alajuela, and Bayano).
In Chile there are many small cooperatives of shellfish and algae producers based on the 12 governmental regions. Some universities, which support the sector with research, have tried to organize the small producers into cooperatives. For example, the Universidad Austral de Chile, at Valdivia, organized producers of mussel spat into a cooperative, and in 1987 its 19 members effectively increased annual production to 300 million spat. The Fundación para la Capacitación del Pescador Artesanal and other institutions have been training artisanal fishermen in aquaculture techniques to increase productivity and thus their overall incomes. The producers of export products are also assisted by the ProChile Organization.
In Colombia several organizations of producers have been created with the aim of strengthening their capabilities and protecting their interests. The main one is the Asociación Nacional de Acuicultores which includes trout and other warmwater fish species producers as well as the Pacific shrimp farmers, while the Caribbean shrimp farmers are affiliated as a Committee of the Fisheries Board of the Asociación Nacional de Industriales. The Asociación de Piscicultores de Huila is a local association of smaller fish farmers.
In Mexico the exploitation and production of either of the high value marine species, including shrimp and oysters, are reserved exclusively to cooperative societies. Therefore all shrimp and oyster producers by law have to associate themselves into cooperatives; approximately 100 such aquaculture organizations exist. Seventy of these cooperatives are members of the National Federation of Cooperatives. The shrimp farming cooperatives alone employ some 6 000 members and technicians.
Independent small-scale and commercial producers have formed the Asociación Mexicana de Acuicultores to seek common solutions to technical, financial, and marketing problems. Among other activities they have organized annual conferences to exchange information and discuss strategies to strengthen their own organization. The National Chamber of the Fishing Industry is another organization of the private sector which has been actively lobbying to allow them to culture shrimp and other species without necessarily having to associate with cooperatives.
In Ecuador shrimp farmers have formed their own trade association, the Camara de Productores de Camaron. This association groups the 14 000 permanent workers of the shrimp farming industry (including owners, administrative employees, biologists, and technicians plus some other 1 500 hatchery workers). However, the estimated 30 000 fishermen dedicated to the collection of wild seed stock do not necessarily benefit from the formation of such an association.
Peru has the Asociación de Langostineros formed by 43 of the 120 private shrimp producers. However, there is no association among the freshwater fish producers. Almost all the shellfish growers are members of the Asociación de Conchilicultores. Panama also has an association of shrimp farmers.
2.6 Financial investment by public and private enterprises
Although credited with substantial investment in the aquaculture sector of Latin American countries, development banks only provide loans to governments for investment in the aquaculture sectors. The recipient governments, who agree to pay back the loans, should be recognized as the principal investors of the US$ 50 million or more of external funds which have been channelled into the sector in the last decade. In addition to the repayments of loans, there has also been incalculable domestic investment by most countries interested in developing aquaculture as an industry.
The IDB has provided about US$ 30 million over the last decade to the regional sector. For example, in Panama the IDB has made a series of loans for fish farming (US$ 4 million) and shrimp farming (US$ 9 million) combined with a national programme (US$ 7 million); Peru has received US$ 4 million for shrimp farming. Similar schemes have been granted to other countries, mainly Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. The World Bank (WB) has also provided loans for aquaculture as part of major development loans, and financing capital construction, training, credit, and management. For example, as part of a US$ 135 million loan to Chile, a small part was for salmon ranching.
Domestic investment may be assisted in a number of ways. In particular there are (i) quasi-commercial loan assistance schemes, (ii) grants and subsidies, and (iii) indirect support through administration, extension, research, education, and training.
(i) Quasi-commercial loan assistance schemes. There is considerable domestic investment through loan schemes handled by the national, agricultural, and fisheries development banks. Credit is available for farmers mostly for construction and rehabilitation of facilities, though in some countries of the region it is also available for operations, and the annual purchase of seeds lock, feeds, and labour.
(ii) Government grants and subsidies. Many aquaculturists take advantage of government grants, usually provided through national development boards established to stimulate investment in new technologies, or to promote integrated rural development. In some countries of the region there are subsidies from the fisheries department for feeds, nets, and other equipment. Coastal aquaculture farmers have also benefited from subsidies for land reclamation and the provision of other public services.
(iii) Indirect support. Most governments underwrite the investment they provide in the normal course of national sector management. This includes the cost of sectorial administration and government services, such as the regulatory and extension departments. Indirect support also includes research and development for aquaculture, either at national aquaculture research centres and fisheries laboratories, and at national universities. In fact, education and manpower training is a further hidden and expensive national cost, and consequently in most countries of the region, these have been significant components of external assistance. Finally, most governments operate production facilities (hatcheries and farms) to supply seed to encourage further aquaculture development or to manage and operate culture-based fisheries. These production activities are not always managed economically, and therefore seed resources are subsidized.
The present aquaculture production in Latin America is the result of considerable private and public investment in the sector. The private sector generally invests most of its capital in the production of cash crops (export products), mainly marine shrimps and shellfish, but in the case of Chile in salmon. For example, all shrimp culture in Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Venezuela, and Central American countries is in the hands of the private sector. In Mexico, however, the so-called "organized social sector" has recently invested over US$ 1.6 million in hatchery facilities for molluscs and at present is constructing several other shrimp hatcheries. The public sector, on the other hand, continues to fund the national infrastructure, such as production facilities (hatcheries), research and training centres, and experimental fish stations, all of which lead to increased production of finfish for local markets, particularly for the culture-based fisheries.
The Government of Belize and foreign financial groups have played key roles in the early development of the country's shrimp culture industry. The Government has established a Mariculture Unit to oversee and aid shrimp farmers, who are eligible for fiscal incentives. About US$ 6.5 million has been invested in the industry so far and an additional US$ 11.5 million is planned, of which 95% has come from foreign sources, primarily the USA.
The Government of Mexico has an ambitious programme for the development of shrimp farming, based on an agreement between the social and private sectors that calls for an investment of over US$ 300 million to develop some 70 000 ha of coastal ponds and reach a production of some 60 000 t per year. The Government's role in the industry, as it is now structured, is critical, given the exclusion of private investors. The rapid expansion of the industry is drawing the attention of many companies interested in supplying materials and services. Some of the Government's past achievements, such as the development of a major tuna industry, would indicate that if its Ministry of Fisheries actively supports the industry, Mexico should be able to develop one of Latin America's most important shrimp culture industries.
In Ecuador foreign investment and technical assistance (primarily but not exclusively from France, Japan, and the USA) have played a key role in the industry's development, even though the industry was initiated by Ecuadorean investors. US investment alone possibly exceeds US$ 300 million. Companies, financed or managed by foreign owners, control the shrimp export business, shrimp feed and fertilizers, many semi-intensive farms, and some of the most successful hatcheries.
Various government agencies have been active in the development of the shrimp farming industry in Brazil. The Superintendencia de Desenvolvimiento Pesqueiro and other government institutions have been promoting commercial development. In 1981, spurred by government credits, the first commercial shrimp farms were built. By 1984 almost US$ 23 million in low-interest loans to support the industry had been invested. The IDB has provided about US$ 15 million to the Brazilian Government to finance commercial shrimp culture projects as part of a much larger fisheries development programme approved in 1980. A few major companies dominate Brazil's marine shrimp culture industry, but some of these farms are experiencing technical and economic problems mostly because they culture indigenous species. Technical advances, such as increased hatchery production of P. vannamei and the development of better feeds for indigenous species, could rapidly change the situation.
The Ministry of Fisheries of Peru recognizes the industry's potential and has been promoting its development. Many Peruvian farms are associations formed by small groups of investors. Several of these farmers have associated themselves into larger marketing investment groups. Although the industry was severely affected in 1982-83 by the El Niño climatic changes, it has recovered and is expected to continue expanding over the next few years. The Peruvian Institute of Foreign Commerce has arranged for technical assistance for shrimp farmers from the EEC.
2.7 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
International assistance first began to flow into the region when it was believed that subsistence aquaculture could make a significant contribution to rural development. This assistance was initially provided in terms of research and development of fish culture technologies which included biological and ecological studies, pond construction, artificial reproduction, seedstock production, feeding and nutrition studies, in addition to training human resources in these same fields. Most assistance projects were oriented toward the culture of freshwater fishes, then attention was focused on freshwater prawn and later toward culture of molluscs. Only recently has marine shrimp attracted the attention of both international assistance agencies and foreign investors.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) played an important role in the initial stages of rural fish farming development in various countries of the region, notably in Central America, Brazil, and Colombia. Its general strategy was to create or strengthen a central hatchery or fish culture station from which to deploy its extension programme. This was integrated by Peace Corps volunteers as well as by local extension agents. Tilapia was the main species propagated for the subsistence fish farming projects promoted by USAID.
Eventually other international agencies provided technical assistance to countries of the region. UNDP/FAO implemented a number of projects in nearly all countries of the region, generally oriented toward the development of rural fish farming. Their main achievement was strengthening governments' capabilities to produce seedstock for stocking ponds and to conduct their own extension, training, and research programmes. Specialists and highly qualified experts were commissioned as technical advisors to these projects, who were assisted by the Regional Fisheries Officer.
Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance for production projects is continuing to flow into the region. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is supporting projects in Costa Rica (freshwater finfish), Chile (molluscs and seaweeds), and Brazil (coastal aquaculture). JICA is providing technical assistance to Peru (scallops), Chile (molluscs), Bolivia (trout and tropical fish farming), and Panama (shrimp). Projects financed by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) are underway in Peru (hatchery operations), Ecuador (culture of chame, a native species), in Colombia (culture of colossomids), and Panama (marine polyculture). USAID is assisting Ecuador (shrimp hatcheries), Panama (shrimp and freshwater ponds), and El Salvador (tilapia culture). The Institut Français de Recherche pour le Développement en Coopération (ORSTOM) and the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) have assisted the region by sponsoring fisheries and fish farming
projects, respectively, in Bolivia. Taiwan, Province of China (PC) has assisted Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Colombia to develop freshwater prawn farming.
2.8 Capital assistance projects in the sub-sector
In the countries of the region, capital assistance for the construction of all types of production facilities has so far played a vitally important role in development. Principal facilities which have qualified for capital aid are government demonstration farms, production hatcheries, and small-scale pond complexes for new farmers. Although varying among the different agencies and financing organizations, capital aid has usually been given to Latin America in association with technical assistance and/or a component for credit.
The Interamerican Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Turrialba, Costa Rica, was funded by the Organization of American States (OAS) through the IDB supporting aquaculture within the region. More recently the OAS has contributed to the construction of a shrimp hatchery and a pilot farm in Suriname.
JICA has financed a salmon hatchery and farms for smolt production in Chile, and another hatchery for the production of molluscs at Coquimbo, as a joint project with the Universidad del Norte. In Ecuador the Centro Nacional de Acuicultura e Investigaciones Marinas also received significant capital aid from JICA.
USAID has financed the construction of freshwater fish hatcheries and ponds in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. ODA assisted in the construction of a hatchery in Bolivia.
In Guyana, Guyana-Aquaculture, the local subsidiary of France-Aquaculture, built a shrimp hatchery and pilot farm. The Government of Taiwan (PC) has provided capital assistance to the Uruguayan Instituto Nacional de Pesca for the construction of a freshwater shrimp hatchery.

3.1 Extension services in the region
In Latin American countries aquaculture extension is usually the responsibility of the respective ministries in which fisheries and/or aquaculture belongs. Most extension services are established to work with individual farmers, rather than any of the larger corporations engaging in aquaculture.
Extension agents assist farmers with site selection, pond construction, water management, provision of seed, and harvesting, and most of this well-established work concerns the farming of trout, tilapia, and common carp. However, extension assistance now is not limited to pond farming, and agents advise and assist small-scale fishermen and farmers to practise extensive culture in dams and other water bodies. Agents also help in the search for government funding for farmers, and in the management of resources, either as produced by farmers or exploited natural resources.
In the last decade extension services have been needed to assist farmers in the production of a range of species; for example, with crustaceans, such as marine shrimps and freshwater prawns, with molluscs, such as oysters, mussels, and scallops, and with the harvesting and handling of marine algae. Most traditional extension agents had little or no experience themselves with these new species and farming practices.
In Latin America, as in most other regions, aquaculture extension services are constrained by the lack of operational funds for transportation and for materials. This severely limits the extent to which agents visit farmers and make trips which last more than one day. Although many countries still use aquaculture extension specialists to work with farmers, some countries, such as Panama, make aquaculture specialists available first to agricultural extensionists who often have more operational resources to reach the farmers. In this way a large number of farmers are potentially covered by the available aquaculture expertise in the country.
In Argentina a programme of the National University of Comahue has recently been launched with the objective of integrating aquaculture to rural development. This extension programme is being implemented by the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria.
In Bolivia the Development Corporation of Tarija is conducting extension activities to promote subsistence fish farming in the Province of Santa Cruz. JICA is collaborating with the Centro de Desarrollo Pesquero to promote trout culture in ponds among 78 communities.
In Chile the National Fisheries Service does not have extension programmes per se, as most production is carried out by the private sector. Restocking programmes are carried out by the Division of Fisheries Protection which has activities in intensive culture of salmon for restocking inland waters.
Colombia has developed a vast infrastructure for the provision of extension services. The primary government agency responsible for aquaculture development is the Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales, created in 1969. Its Division of Fisheries has 5 regional offices and operates 8 freshwater hatcheries and research stations, and 2 marine research stations. Through the Programme of Protection of Deteriorated Basins over 500 families have become engaged in integrated fish farming. The Integrated Rural Development Programme built more than 1 600 ponds occupying a total area of almost 54 ha in 475 different communities with resources financed by the IDB and WB. Extension programmes include technical assistance, training, seedstock production, and publication of instructional materials. Extension is also conducted by 11 Regional Corporations, Regional Offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Federation of Coffee Producers, Universities, and other non-governmental
organizations.
In Costa Rica aquaculture extension was initiated by the Turrialba Agricultural Diversification Institute and has been continued by the Aquaculture Department and other administrative governmental agencies. The scope of extension activities is rather limited despite the assistance provided by foreign institutions.
In Ecuador extension programmes are undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, although the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral provides technical assistance for producers and organizes training courses for extension agents.
In El Salvador the Fish and Game Section of the Ministry of Economy, and the Fishery Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, provide extension services as an integral part of the foreign technical assistance projects which have been implemented in the country. These projects have invariably dealt with production of fingerlings for stocking, pond fish culture, site location, and project preparation and design.
In Guatemala extension is provided by the Fisheries and Aquaculture Directorate, by US Peace Corps, CARE, and by a Chinese technical mission. Extension is oriented toward the transfer of technology and the training of small-scale fish farmers.
In Guyana three officers of the Ministry of Agriculture are engaged in aquaculture extension and in services such as the delivery of fingerlings, site selection, and design and construction of ponds.
In Honduras although extension services are yet very limited they tend to concentrate on the smaller subsistence farmers, while the small-scale and commercial producers do not benefit from governmental support.
In Mexico state and federal hatcheries and fish stations offer technical assistance and training in almost all aspects of aquaculture, and provide seedstock to small-scale farmers on demand. However, no formal extension service with a structured organization and with a scheduled programme has ever been established. Culture-based fisheries are serviced by another Division of the same Ministry, which has a more comprehensive programme and covers other sociological aspects related to fishermen's communities. Credit institutions also assist producers in the management of operations as a means of ensuring their capability to repay loans.
It is perhaps in Panama where extension in aquaculture is best developed, having had a better coordinated plan of action at the national level as well as a more thorough integration with the rest of the institutional components of the National Directorate of Aquaculture. This is one of the reasons why rural aquaculture in this country has been far more successful than in most other countries of the region.
Most governments have found it difficult to provide technical assistance to private farmers, especially to shrimp growers. Few countries in the region have an extension service which is effectively introducing improved methods to growers. Such a service would be difficult to introduce as any technician with appropriate knowledge could make more money by offering consulting services or going into business.
3.2 Training of extension agents
Training in extension methodology in the countries of the region is not a formal or a widespread practice, mostly because governments do not always recognize that an extension service represents an important mechanism whereby innovations or new systems can be introduced at the national or regional level. Most extension agents, however, have some formal technical schooling in fisheries and/or aquaculture, as well as some practical experience acquired at fish culture stations.
As government salaries are usually low, candidates for training and employment as extension workers are not highly motivated individuals. This fact not only reduces the efficiency of training courses, but also reflects in the efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel employed once training is terminated. It is expected that this situation will change as the aquaculture sector develops within each country. Ideally, government staff should be given the opportunity to obtain an education in aquaculture as a beginning of any effort to develop a strategy for aquaculture development.
During the last decade most countries have increased the level of proficiency of the personnel in charge of extension, either through in-country or outside training at undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels. There is at least one institution in each Latin American country where extension workers are trained, or where follow-up and refresher courses are given. Although few of these institutions offer specialized instruction on aquaculture extension methodology as such, qualified personnel for the dissemination and extension of aquaculture are becoming generally available. Unfortunately not all national aquaculture development plans have yet recognized the importance of creating a well structured extension service as a branch of their governmental institution responsible for the administration of the sector. The feedback derived from this extension service could help to improve articulation of the research and training divisions and thus address the needs of the
productive sector in a more coherent manner. It could also promote overall development of aquaculture according to objectives set by any national aquaculture development plan.
In Chile the Institute of Professional Training specializes in practical instruction on applicable technologies and includes aquaculture in its curricula. The Artisanal Fishermen's Training Foundation, though aimed at the producer, also provides training applicable to extension agents due to its applied technical nature. The Universidad Austral organizes short-term courses on aquaculture for technicians and extension agents.
In Colombia, since 1960, the Fish Farming Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture has offered informal training courses for technicians. Other informal short-term courses have been organized by the Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales in collaboration with USAID and Auburn University, as well as with experts who have worked for various technical assistance projects implemented in the country. The National Learning Service has also contributed to the formation of extension services, although on a lesser scale.
Costa Rica contemplates training of extension agents through courses to be organized by both existing and planned demonstration centres. Training would be carried out by graduates from either of the two national universities.
El Salvador has no formal institution capable of providing instruction to extension agents. Until now agents have been trained on-the-job during the course of technical assistance projects implemented in the country. It is anticipated that future needs will be satisfied through in-country training by graduate professionals.
In Guatemala the Marine and Aquaculture Study Centre of the University of San Carlos offers graduate studies in the field of aquaculture and training courses at the intermediate level; 34 technicians have been trained to-date. Extension agents have also received on-the-job training during participation in technical assistance projects.
Guyana has no specialized training institution for extension agents. Agents have been trained either in-country by foreign experts collaborating in technical assistance projects or have been sent abroad, mainly to other Caribbean Commonwealth countries.
Honduras, like most other Central American countries, has had to rely exclusively on foreign assistance projects to train national extension agents.
Extension training in Mexico is offered in several educational and technical institutions that specialize in marine sciences and aquaculture training. The Marine Science and Technology Division of the Ministry of Education has a schooling network system of more than 20 centres which offer training in aquaculture at the secondary and intermediate levels. Colleges of Technical Education offer technical training in aquaculture in several of their coastal and inland facilities. The General Directorate of Aquaculture, through both special training courses and the regular activities of the federal hatcheries and fish stations, offers short technical training courses in subjects relevant to extension. Technicians from other countries have received training in aquaculture as educational programmes are open to nationals of other countries of the region.
In Panama the National Directorate of Aquaculture initially provided extension training for its own employees who eventually became its own agents. At present a well structured programme on extension training is in place and it satisfies its own manpower requirements as well as those of neighbouring countries in the region which have requested assistance in the form of training. Ad hoc courses are also organized as the demand arises.
In Paraguay the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Asuncion, with the support of the Aquaculture Department, is organizing a special course for extension as a component of the project entitled "Centre for the Promotion of Rural Fish Farming".
In spite of the comparatively advanced state of development of its aquaculture sector, Peru still lacks the institutional infrastructure to provide formal training in extension.
In Uruguay extension training is provided by the Labour University, although in practice many technicians receive extension training on-the-job at the aquaculture stations of the National Fisheries Institute.
The School of Fisheries of Cumana in Venezuela as well as the La Salle Foundation, in its Nautical Fishing School, offer technical training in aquaculture at the intermediate level, and include some topics relevant to extension.
It can be appreciated that the regional infrastructure for training in aquaculture is constituted by numerous institutions, few of which specialize in extension methodology. Therefore, many appointed extension agents, in practice, are empirically trained on-the-job. This is broadly reflected on the quality of the extension services of most countries and, as such, it is recognized that this limitation constitutes a major constraint to the development of aquaculture in the region.
3.3 Seed production facilities in the region
In the region as described there are many hatcheries for the production of juvenile finfish, crustaceans, and also for molluscs. Hatchery technology is not new to most of the countries, as for example trout hatcheries have been in existence for decades in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru.
However, the low production of juveniles remains one of the major bottlenecks for the growth of aquaculture in Latin America and therefore more modern hatchery technology for the large range of species of marine shrimps, molluscs, and fish presently being cultured, has to be imported. Hatchery technology commonly used in the region comes from North America, Europe, and Asia.
In order to make the industry independent of wild sources of post-larvae (PLs) numerous marine shrimp hatcheries have been constructed in recent years. In Ecuador the Government has granted more than 140 permits to build hatcheries, of which at least 110 are now operational. All of them produce Penaeus vannamei, and their average output capacity ranges from 0.5 to 15.0 million PLs/month. The largest hatchery has an installed capacity of 250 million PLs/month. Several of the newer hatcheries are relatively small as experience has shown that smaller hatcheries generate higher profit margins. However, over 50% of PL production in 1987 (4 thousand million) came from the 10 largest hatcheries.
Commercial hatchery operators have made great progress in recent years and insist that they will be able to supply growers with 50% of total yearly demand, which at present amounts to a level of 15 thousand million PLs. Even in Ecuador most hatcheries still depend on the availability of wild gravid females, although technological and managerial practices necessary to produce larvae through maturation and reproduction in captivity have already been perfected by several hatcheries. These technological advances are spreading quickly throughout the industry.
In Panama a substantial part of PL supplies to the farms is produced in the 6 largest commercial hatcheries, namely, Aquachame, Agromarina, Agromar, Canasa, Granjas Marinas, and Palangosta, all of which are capable of producing about one thousand million PLs per year.
Brazil reportedly has at least 14 operational shrimp hatcheries, with a total annual production under one thousand million PLs, mainly of Penaeus schmitti and P. subtilis.
In Colombia at least 7 hatcheries are in operation along the Caribbean coast and 3 others are located on the Pacific. Most of these hatcheries produce P. vannamei, with a total output just under 0.5 thousand million PLs per year.
Peru has five main operational shrimp hatcheries, namely, Lab-Peru, Brookstock, Bioltecsa, Acualarva and Tecnomar, with a capacity to supply only about 10% of the estimated demand which is about 1 thousand million PLs per year.
In Venezuela there is no significant production of shrimp PLs, as commercial hatcheries are only in the process of being constructed.
Mexico has 11 shrimp hatcheries, the combined annual production capacity of which is 0.3 thousand million PLs. In addition to these, others are presently under construction. Although at present demand can be met by supplies from wild origins, it is anticipated that, due to the rapid expansion of the industry, in the near future there will be a severe shortage of PLs for stocking grow-out ponds.
The main hatcheries for molluscs are mostly located in Chile and Mexico. In the former, five hatcheries produce clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and abalone. Part of the production of spat is exported to farms in Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. Oyster and mussel hatcheries also operate in Mexico. These supply some 66 million oyster spat to 55 cooperatives, while new hatcheries are under construction. There are also three hatcheries, under construction in Peru, which will have a capacity of some 30 million spat.
Finfish hatcheries, common throughout all countries, are operated by the public sector. Data for the production of tilapia and common carp fry are imprecise or unavailable, as propagation is generally carried out in ponds at breeding stations, rather than in hatcheries. On the other hand, production of juveniles of species whose reproduction is artificially induced, and/or which require egg incubation or larval rearing (Chinese carps, colossoma, trout, freshwater prawns, catfish, black bass, and marine finfish) is usually better documented.
In Mexico in 1987 the annual production of fry was trout (10.9 million), tilapia (65.2 million), carp (68.3 million). Of post-larvae shrimp it was 23.1 million, mollusc spat 229.2 million, and others 36 million.
It is worthwhile noting that countries interested in the culture of native species have generally made some progress in developing technologies for the production of seedstock, and have adapted the necessary facilities to both conduct research and produce small amounts. For instance, Argentina is now capable of producing black catfish (Rhamdia sapo). Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela produce Colossomids. Chile produces several species of native molluscs and Gracilaria. Panama produces tucunare (Cichla ocellaris), and Peru produces pejerrey (Odontesthes bonairensis).
Extension in aquaculture, as practised in the region, is based mainly on the supply of seedstock for the producers. Therefore most institutions in charge of extension concentrate on the production of seed. Government hatcheries become focal points for their extension programmes. This has also been the strategy of technical assistance projects attempting to introduce aquaculture into the region.
Small trout hatcheries have become common in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. With the development of the salmon farming industry in Chile, several hatcheries have been built. Fundación Chile constructed a facility for the production of smolts for salmon farmers. Salmonid farmers in Chile and in other countries also import eyed-eggs from North America, Japan, and Europe.
3.4 Manufacture of feed and fertilizer in the region
Most aquaculture production in the region is through extensive systems such as culture-based fisheries or subsistence fish farming, or for molluscs which rely on natural production of plankton for their feeding. However, with the increase in the intensification of aquaculture practices, the need for artificial feeds has increased considerably. Manufacture of these feeds has had to be adapted to each species under cultivation.
The shrimp industry in Panama was introduced by a North American animal feed company which pioneered applied research on shrimp feed formulation. The feed used in most commercial operations is either acquired locally in Panama or is imported from the USA, Europe, or Taiwan (PC). As demand has continued to increase, many locally established subsidiaries of multinational feed corporations and local manufacturers started to produce equivalent formulated diets for shrimp and other species.
In most countries of the region the trout industry, for instance, has always relied on feeds supplied by these subsidiaries and local manufacturers. Some of these feeds have not always been competitive in terms of quality and/or price, due to the limitations attributed to the unavailability of some ingredients, particularly micronutrients and binders. In other cases, locally available agro-industrial products or by-products are incorporated into the diets to replace some of the recommended ingredients to reduce the price. This poorly understood economy produces mixed results as, even though prices are lower, poor feed conversion efficiency ratios are obtained, adversely affecting the economics of the aquaculture operation.
More research on feed formulation has been conducted at the local level to reduce feed prices without altering specified quality. The results have gradually been assimilated by both the subsidiaries of the multinational feed corporations and by local manufacturers. Fine quality feeds are also manufactured locally under licenses of foreign companies.
More specialized feeds used by shrimp and prawn hatcheries (namely Artemia cysts and micro-encapsulated diets) are imported into the region. The quantity of Artemia cysts needed to feed the shrimp larvae being produced in the region is estimated to be 6-8 t per year, although some experts believe that may increase to around 30 t by 1990. Only in some instances locally available sources of Artemia are exploited and/or used directly by existing hatcheries. Most attempts to exploit Artemia resources in the region have failed, except for a large venture located at Salinas du Rio Grande du Norte in Brazil which, since 1977, produced and exported large quantities of high quality cysts. However, eventually production dwindled and the company ceased to operate. Other Artemia resources of the region have been exploited and marketed abroad by foreign enterprises. None the less, since world prices of Artemia have decreased considerably, it is unlikely that in the foreseeable future new
commercial ventures will be undertaken.
Inorganic (chemical) fertilizers, another input used in intensive fish and shrimp farming, are readily available in the larger countries of the region, and to a lesser extent also in the smaller ones, although more costly as they have to be imported.
Extension programmes encourage the use of organic fertilizers in both subsistence and small-scale farming. Cattle and chicken manures, as well as other agricultural wastes available locally, are used for this purpose. Whenever possible, extension programmes also promote integrated agro-aquaculture practices as a means of improving the utilization of the resources available to the smaller farmers.
3.5 Manufacturers of equipment for the industry
Most aquaculture practices in the region are pond-based extensive or semi-intensive systems. Consequently, equipment for pond construction has been in ever increasing demand. Installations for pond-based aquaculture typically include ponds, dams, and dikes; feeder and drainage canals or pipes, monk or pipe sluices, spillways, and other fish control structures (screens); and in many cases complete pumping stations.
Standard equipment used in the construction industry (bulldozers, pay loaders, excavators, graders, scrapers, and dredgers) is used for the construction of such installations. Depending on comparative costs, this equipment may either be hired or acquired locally. Non-specialized standard materials, pipes and piping, fittings, valves, pumps and other hydraulic equipment, are manufactured in the larger countries of the region. The smaller countries, however, have to import these items at greater expense.
Ordinary equipment and materials, such as pumps, generators, netting, containers, and floats, which are also used in other industries, are generally available within the region. However, specialized equipment normally used in more intensive aquaculture facilities, such as cages, tanks, raceways and flow-through systems, water-recirculating systems, and in hatcheries and laboratories, is still not manufactured within the region and has to be imported either from North America, Europe, or the Far East. Among other items, this equipment may include aerators, blowers, pumps, filters, sterilizers, mechanical feeders and harvesters, graders, incubators, tanks, and most of the equipment used for the manufacture of formulated feeds.
The aquaculture sector of the region also relies heavily on the importation of special scientific equipment, instruments, and chemicals used in hatcheries and in laboratories. These include microscopes, water testing equipment, analyzers, salinometers, oxygen and pH meters, and spectrophotometers, as well as chemical substances, disinfectants, medicines, and antibiotics. Some basic equipment, such as glassware, microscopes, and balances, and some chemicals, are manufactured under license in few countries of the region; other items are sold by authorized distributors. However, until very recently, few authorized distributors of equipment, instruments, and chemicals specialized in the trade existed. Aquaculturists are therefore obliged to import directly whatever equipment or substances may be required. This causes inconveniences to producers in terms of effort, time, economy, and appropriateness of the acquisition itself.
3.6 Other services for the industry
Although limited in number, consulting services by individuals and companies are available to the industry in some countries. These services tend to concentrate on areas such as project formulation, technical and economic feasibility analysis, and farm construction. However, other vital areas, such as marketing, planning and management, disease prevention and control, and hatchery design, are not yet covered by existing consulting services.
There appears to be a shortage of national expertise in hatchery technologies and in the planning and management of production facilities. There is also a lack of experienced consulting engineers, particularly for civil and mechanical design and construction of both hatcheries and farms. At present this work is being undertaken by qualified engineers who merely copy other facilities and attempt to adapt them to a given site with little understanding of the processes involved. Consequently, more specialized services are supplied by foreign experts from North America, Europe, or the Far East.
Non-technical subject matters of aquaculture, such as extension methodology, sector planning, farm management, project formulation and evaluation, marketing, and legislation, have been neglected by most study programmes offered by universities, and this reflects the lack of experts in these areas vital for development.
3.7 Local credit programmes
The scope, purpose, and conditions of local credit programmes vary greatly from country to country. In those areas where commercial aquaculture is evident, the private banking sector now routinely finances both capital investment and operational funds. In Ecuador, for example, where shrimp farming is successful and profitable, most private banks will finance almost every shrimp farm with acceptable collateral.
In several countries (Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, and Panama) funds are lent by national and agricultural development banks as they originate as major development loans provided by the international development banks, most frequently the IDB. These loans are normally given on favourable terms; for example, loans for financing an aquaculture project can be as high as 80% of the initial capital investment and start-up operations, and have a repayment moratorium of three years.
Major development loans from the international banks are often directed toward aquaculture systems and practices which are not yet fully viable and economically self-sustaining. The programme funded by the international lender to the national bank often includes a component of technical assistance to ensure that funds are used for specific projects which are both technically feasible and financially viable. This arrangement, however, has not always worked.
The IDB has assisted the region through long-term credit to national financial institutions, or through national projects which have a credit component. The IDB has provided about US$ 30 million during the last decade to the regional sector. For example, in Panama it has made a series of loans for fish farming (US$ 4 million) and shrimp farming (US$ 9 million), combined with a national programme (US$ 7 million); Peru has received US$ 4 million for shrimp farming, as well as Brazil and Ecuador. In Mexico a similar loan was awarded for the development of the fisheries sector, a large proportion of which was assigned for the aquaculture sub-sector, supported by bank financing from the national fisheries development bank.
In some countries there is also domestic investment through loan schemes handled by national and agricultural development banks. Credit is available for farmers for both construction and initial operation of farms. In Brazil and Mexico initiatives by national banks have led to active programmes by which direct and specific credit programmes are now well established in rural aquaculture/fisheries development banks.
Although most agricultural banks of the countries of the region have credit facilities for farmers in general, their minimum loans are either too high for the small-scale rural farmers, or they are unable to warrant the normal collateral requirements. The larger investors and farmers, on the contrary, take advantage of these soft loans and are able to benefit and capitalize on government subsidies awarded to both aquaculture and fisheries sectors in the form of raw materials, equipment, feeds, banking services, tax deductions, support to producers, and insurance.
In Mexico two national Trust Funds for the Development of Fisheries and Agriculture, created several years ago, offer credit loans to aquaculture producers. The programmes under which they operate are specifically designed for the sector and are, therefore, specially suited to meet the typical needs of both small-scale producers and large investors. Producers are required to follow the recommendations formulated by the assistants provided by the institutions to ensure the repayment of loans. These funds can also be used for the elaboration of feasibility and pre-investment studies.
3.8 Trade publications for producers
There are few specific regional trade publications produced in the region for the farmers and for the industry in general. As the aquaculture sector expands, both associations of producers and trade publications have started to appear in various countries. For example, in Ecuador the first edition of the quarterly trade magazine "Cultivos Aquanet" has just been published. It contains general information and news on recent developments on shrimp farming in Ecuador and other countries of the region. It also contains advertisements of various commercial suppliers to the industry. The Chamber of Shrimp Producers in Ecuador edits its own occasional trade journal "Acuicultura del Ecuador" to furnish its members with current aquaculture information relevant to the industry.
In Mexico the two monthly fisheries trade publication "Tecnica Pesquera" is increasing the number of articles and information on aquaculture in its contents. Another magazine entirely devoted to aquaculture is "Aquavision" published by the National Trust Fund for the Development of Fisheries (FONDEPESCA). Although not truly commercial in nature, it contains technological information and latest developments in Mexico and elsewhere.
More regional and scientific in nature are the Bulletin of the Regional Aquaculture Network of the IDRC, the Newsletter of the Asociación Latino Americana de Acuicultura (ALA) and the "Revista Latino Americana de Acuicultura" published by the Organización Latinoamericana de Desarrollo Pesquero (OLDEPESCA). These three publications present an overview of aquaculture development in the region and give an update on the activities of their respective organizations, all of which can be considered of interest to the sector of the region.
The FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean publishes a newsletter informing member countries on the achievements of its activities, as well as general information on FAO's regional or national projects.
Some governmental organizations responsible for the administration of aquaculture, and which are usually in charge of extension, publish newsletters for information of their own staff. These newsletters are also of interest to the sector as they provide internal information at a local level which assists producers to keep up-to-date on governments' actions and policies. Technical information of direct use to the producers is sometimes included.
"Chile Pesquero" is another trade magazine which occasionally contains news and articles of interest to the local aquaculture industry in Chile.
"Aquarius" is the quarterly bulletin of OLDEPESCA through which information on the activities of the organization is delivered to its member countries.
The Centro de Pesquisa e Trenamiento en Acuicultura in Pirassununga (CEPTA), Brazil, publishes a technical bulletin which provides information on the activities of the Centre as well as the results of the research conducted at its experimental facilities.
The region has immediate access to a large range of North American and European publications for the trade through individual subscriptions. These include:
- "Aquaculture Magazine" and its annual Buyer's Guide;
- "World Shrimp Farming", a two-monthly report covering shrimp and prawn farming;
- "Mollusk Farming, USA", covers clam, abalone, scallop, mussel and oyster farming in the USA;
- the Aquaculture Association of Canada Bulletin, a quarterly with emphasis on the science of salmon farming;
- "Canadian Aquaculture", a two-monthly trade journal with extensive coverage of marine culture;
- "World Aquaculture", the quarterly magazine of the World Aquaculture Society (WAS);
- the Artemia Reference Center Newsletter (Belgium) containing news and abstracts of research and use for aquaculture;
- the "Water Farming Journal" (USA);
- "Fish Farming International" (UK);
- "Fish Farmer" (UK);
- "Salmon Farming".
3.9 Technical assistance projects in the sub-sector
Technical assistance for infrastructure has played an important role in the development of the sector in Latin America. For example, El Salvador and Honduras received technical assistance for local infrastructure from various external sources. The IDB granted El Salvador US$ 4 750 000 credit for, among other actions, the construction of 100 ha of coastal shrimp and fish ponds, and USAID supported both countries through the creation of special trust funds for infrastructure to the private sector to be administered through soft loans.
JICA financed the construction of a hatchery for fingerling production in Bolivia to produce seedstock for fish farmers.
In 1982 the IDB granted the National Bank of Panama US$ 13.2 million to finance an aquaculture development scheme which included two projects. One was a credit component of US$ 8.85 million to finance investment and technical assistance in shrimp farming (with a corresponding US$ 4.9 million Panamanian counterpart to finance working capital and feasibility studies); and the other component was of US$ 4.35 million (with a counterpart of US$ 2.1 million) to finance infrastructure needed for the promotion and extension of farming of fish for domestic consumption.
Apart from technical assistance provided to credit institutions (identified above), technical assistance aimed specifically at improving local infrastructure for the provision of services and inputs required by the sector has generally been small. While technical assistance has been provided for the running of government-owned hatcheries and fish culture stations, and therefore often in effect has also helped lay the foundation for development of extension services, the primary objective of this assistance has usually been the development of a self-sustaining aquaculture activity (usually pond-based fish culture). There do not seem to have been any projects particularly aimed at helping manufacturers of feed, equipment, or support services of the nature indicated in Section 3.6.
One exception is Chile, where JICA supported the development of an ocean ranching programme for Pacific salmon. In addition to constructing a hatchery, JICA supplied salmon eggs for several years and full technical assistance to establish salmon production. This project, and its ensuing work on cage farming of salmon, was further enhanced by support from Fundación Chile on research and development, particularly with feeds.

4.1 Manpower training in aquaculture technologies
Before aquaculture could expand throughout the Latin American region, technology had to be comprehended and adapted to local conditions. Consequently training and research has preceded extension in aquaculture. Professionals in biology, agronomy, veterinary and other animal sciences were the first to acquire a certain degree of specialization either through their own professional or research experiences, or by occasional contact with foreign experts. This was followed by the return of the first post-graduate students who trained at universities abroad, who were employed as teachers and leaders of experimental research teams at university or government institutions with an interest in or responsibility for aquaculture.
As the aquaculture sector evolved, technicians were trained in their own countries in institutions which incorporated courses on aquaculture, or occasionally a full degree programme. Brazil, Mexico, and Panama were the first countries to lead in manpower training, with the governments reinforcing staffing of public training institutions and supporting collateral activities at the same institutions. Finally, manpower training reached the producers through the organization of short courses, seminars, demonstration sessions, and field days held at government fish culture stations.
At the present time the direct training of producers is a consolidated achievement in many countries of the region, including Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama.
Some 60 to 80 Latin American universities and higher learning institutions grant degrees to marine biologists and fishery engineers. Most countries have at least one such institution which has programmes leading to these degrees at the bachelor level, but only few grant degrees in aquaculture. The former include courses either on aquaculture in general or specific topics as part of curricula in fisheries, marine biology, biology, and veterinary science, and in agriculture, agronomy, and food science, etc.
In Argentina the Instituto de Biologia Marina y Pesquera "Almirante Storni", the Escuela Superior de Biología of the University of Comahue, and the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria are institutions which offer aquaculture courses. In Bolivia there is only one institution that offers training in aquaculture, namely the Centro Piscicola de Tiquina.
In Chile several universities offer the opportunity of obtaining degrees in aquaculture, these are Antofagasta, del Norte (Coquimbo), Católica de Valparaíso, Católica de Chile, Austral de Chile, and also the Instituto Profesional de Osorno.
In Colombia aquaculture training is offered by the Facultad de Acuicultura of the University of Cordoba, and the University of Nariño offers a technical degree in freshwater aquaculture.
In Costa Rica the Escuela de Ciencias Biológicas of the National University at Heredia offers a bachelor's and a master's degree; the latter with a specialization in aquatic pathobiology applied to species cultured in the country. Twenty-one students have graduated since 1987.
In Guatemala the Centro de Estudios del Mar y Acuicultura of the University of San Carlos is the only institution that offers an aquaculture degree at the undergraduate level.
In Honduras the Panamerican Agriculture School offers short courses on general aquaculture and on tilapia culture.
In Mexico training in aquaculture is offered at the secondary, intermediate, and graduate levels in various institutions. Secondary and tertiary schools of the Dirección de Ciencia y Tecnología del Mar of the Ministry of Education offer training among various other related disciplines. At the tertiary level, the National Schools of Technical and Professional Education also offer a technical degree. The Centro de Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia of the National University offers courses and research degrees in its M.Sc. and Ph.D. programmes at its marine research stations on the Pacific and on the Gulf/Caribbean coasts.
Institutions that offer graduate degrees or majors in aquaculture at the graduate level in Mexico are the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, the Escuela de Oceanologia of the University of Baja California, the Instituto Tecnologico de Mar. At the post-graduate level there are the Monterrey Institute and the Ensenada Centre of Scientific Research. To a lesser extent, aquaculture courses and training programmes are offered by most Mexican State Universities as part of the basic undergraduate degree curricula in biological sciences, zoology, and agronomy.
In Panama the Centro de Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia of the University of Panama, at its laboratory of Isla de Naos, offers training in marine aquaculture.
In Paraguay the Departamento de Acuicultura of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Asuncion offers a higher degree in aquaculture and will soon provide training for producers.
In Peru the Departamento de Piscicultura y Oceanologia of the National Agrarian University of La Molina and the University of San Marcos offer courses in aquaculture for fishery engineering degrees.
In Uruguay both graduates in biological oceanography and in veterinary sciences are taught some courses in aquaculture.
In Venezuela training is provided by the Instituto de Capacitación Agricola and the Instituto Agrario Nacional at the level of technicians; at the intermediate level the Escuela de Cumana and the La Salle Foundation (Liceo Nautico Pesquero); at the tertiary level the Instituto de Tecnología del Mar, the Instituto Universitario de Carupano, and the Instituto Universitario de Tecnología de Yaracuy; at the university level the Universidad de Oriente grants a degree with a major in aquaculture, and four other universities include aquaculture in the curricula of biological and veterinary science degrees.
For most post-graduate studies in aquaculture, or in relevant applications such as genetics, zoology, ecology, etc., Latin American students often attend universities in North America, Europe, Japan, or the Soviet Union. The public sector usually sponsors its own staff during such overseas studies, or helps students obtain grants through associated multilateral and bilateral assistance projects in the country. Predominant in providing financial assistance for higher education have been agencies from USA (USAID), the UK (ODA), Canada (IDRC and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)), Japan (JICA), and IDB, as well as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and UNDP. In the private sector aquaculturists are usually left to find their own financial resources.
Short-term technical training courses are managed by a number of universities and technical institutes, but these are often on one subject and irregular. For example, the Universidad de Costa Rica held short courses on pond dynamics as part of activities in the USAID CRSP project. The Escuela Superior Politécnica de Litoral in Ecuador holds a regular 5-week training course for shrimp hatchery technology. The Universidad de Los Llanos in Venezuela; and the Panamerican Agriculture School in Honduras hold courses in general aquaculture and tilapia culture. One exception is the Centro de Estudios Tecnológicos del Mar in Mexico which provides technical training in aquaculture at the tertiary level on a continuous basis. This institution has over 20 schools located along the Pacific and Gulf coastlines as well as inland, close to the major aquaculture development focal centres.
Many short-term courses are organized by the appropriate government departments, particularly in those countries where the sector is reasonably strong or specialized, or is of primary government interest for development (for example, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela).
The FAO Regional Aquaculture Centre for Latin America in Pirassununga, in Brazil, held four long-term (12 months) training courses which involved some 106 participants from 18 countries, between 1980 and 1986. Brazil itself sent 36 trainees, followed by Panama (7), El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua (6 each); Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru (5 each), Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Paraguay (4 each), Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay (3 each), Honduras and Venezuela (2) each, and Argentina (1). Some came from the Caribbean region. In addition, the Centre held short-term courses (from a few days to two weeks' duration) on fish seed production, mollusc culture, trout culture, pond and cage culture, shrimp culture, aquaculture extension, and hatchery technology. Several of these were held outside Brazil.
Since 1986 the new project AQUILA has organized in collaboration with national institutions a number of training courses and other activities on various topics of aquaculture. These were:
- 8 regional training courses in 5 countries with a total participation of 164 representatives from 20 countries. The subjects of the courses were: pathology, nutrition, culture-based fisheries, post-harvest handling and preservation technology, reproduction, sector planning and management, and marine hatchery technology.
- 11 national courses in 6 countries with a total participation of 323 attendees. These courses were in the following subjects: mollusc culture, lakes and impoundment fishery management, post-harvest handling and preservation technology, nutrition, and culture of colossoma.
- 10 regional seminars of coordination and collaboration on Gracilaria culture, shrimp pathology, coastal lagoon management, inland water impoundment management, mollusc culture, and an Aquaculture Information Reference System (SIRIAC).
The FAO Regional Office in Santiago, Chile, organizes courses in aquaculture technologies through its Network for Technical Cooperation in Aquaculture. Technicians from Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru have participated in courses on mollusc culture in controlled environments, and four training courses were held in Jamaica with participants of the region (Guyana, Suriname, and Belize). The Network has also funded the exchange of technical personnel; for example, Chile and Panama exchanged technicians to be trained in the culture of microalgae.
A number of countries have taken advantage of other UNDP/FAO regional courses. For example, three trainees (two from Panama and one from Chile) obtained the post-graduate qualification at the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia (NACA)/Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Aquaculture Department one-year course in the Philippines; and four trainees (one each from Brazil, Panama, Mexico, and Peru) attended the four-month integrated farming course of NACA/Integrated Fish Farming Centre, Wuxi, in China.
The International Centre for Living Aquatic Resources Management and FAO maintain a database for institutions and courses in aquaculture and fisheries world-wide. Obviously, as yet incomplete, only six institutions of the region are listed on this database (in Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, and Venezuela).
4.2 Manpower training in management
Non-technical subject matters of aquaculture such as sector planning, farm management, project formulation and evaluation, marketing, legislation, and methodology of extension have so far been neglected by most study programmes and curricula of the degrees offered by universities. This reflects the lack of expertise in these areas, all of which are vital for the development of the sector.
On the other hand, none of the national public management training institutions in the region has ever offered specialized courses for government aquaculture staff who, although already graduates, have little experience in the management of government institutions, aquaculture production units, hatcheries and laboratories, and credit programmes.
The Latin American Regional Aquaculture Centre in Brazil, was established by UNDP/FAO for the training of senior aquaculturists (mostly from government departments) but the course did not address aspects of management. In recognizing this deficiency, AQUILA has organized an annual Basic Course on Planning and Management of Aquaculture with the main objective of strengthening public administration capabilities in the planning and management of the sector. The first course was implemented in Mexico in 1988, and the second one was offered in 1989 in San Jose, Costa Rica.
4.3 Aquaculture research in the region
Aquaculture research in Latin America is undertaken by three main groups of institutions, namely universities, national and regional administrations, and by the private sector. Most of the 1 000 - 1 500 researchers in Latin America are employed by universities. They cover a large spectrum of disciplines, species, and environments. However, the overwhelming majority of researchers are natural scientists, generally biologists. Although valuable in terms of its applied research efforts, the private sector probably is the smallest contributor to aquaculture research in Latin America, both in the number of man-years provided and the number of subjects covered.
Most university and public sector researchers have focused their experimental work on the adaptation and control of feeding, reproduction, and handling of crustaceans and molluscs. Optimal growth and handling of seaweeds is also a subject of research, as are microalgae, mainly as a source of larval feed.
Considerable effort continues to be directed toward finding local species suitable for culture. During the past decade this effort has resulted in the domestication (artificial reproduction and pond rearing) of the colossomids, some cichlids, and species of Prochilodus and Odonthestes.
While university-sponsored research frequently is basic in nature, that carried out in public fish culture stations aims to adapt already-described procedures to the local environment. However, lack of equipment effectively prevents researchers at many public sector fish culture stations from doing much more than elementary culture trials. Universities, which suffer shortages of funds and equipment, at times try to overcome these constraints by engaging overseas universities in joint research programmes.
Given the nature of the institutions involved and the type of research undertaken (often adaptation to culture of species not yet proven to be commercially viable) it is evident that financing is a problem. Both in universities and in the public sector, aquaculture researchers have to compete for research funds with researchers interested in capture fisheries and agriculture. The public sector researchers obtain their funds directly from the national budget (through the ministries concerned) or through National Research Councils. Nevertheless, during the past decade aquaculture researchers have benefited, in terms of the amounts obtained, by the relative novelty of their subject of investigation.
In Chile Fundación Chile has become a leading research and development organization for the sector. The Fundación now operates three stations, on Chiloe Island, Punta Arenas, and Curraco de Velez, and is involved in the production of trout at Lake Llanquihue, salmon production at Castro (Chiloe), and Pacific oyster production at Tongoy near Coquimbo. Government research is carried out by the Instituto de Fomento Pesquero on general development appropriate to resources of different regions, which includes salmon and oyster culture, restocking scallop beds, and cultivation and management of marine algal resources. It is also carrying out work on post-harvest technology, such as the use of shrimp residues to colour flesh of salmonids.
The Servicio Nacional de Pesca has an R & D section with 7 professionals and 12 technicians, most of whom work on the Chile/JICA programme for salmon enhancement in Aysen Province, and on the restocking of Gracilaria beds. The Faculty of Science in the Universidad del Norte at Coquimbo works on problems with culture of scallops, Pacific oyster, and Gracilaria. The Universidad Austral de Chile at Valdivia works on oyster and mussel culture. The Instituto Profesional de Osorno works on trout cultivation and on smolt production of salmon, as well as Gracilaria production.. The Universidad de Valparaiso works on depuration of shellfish, and the University of Conception on seaweed culture. The Catholic University of Santiago is working on both mollusc and seaweed projects, and the University of Iquique has just begun projects relevant to aquaculture development in the far north of the country.
In Argentina the Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero is attempting to adapt fish culture technology to conditions prevailing in some remote areas of the country, especially for black catfish and silverside. The University of Comahue is working on the adaptation of Percycthys spp. to culture conditions. The Instituto de Biología Marina y Pesquera "Almirante Storni" is conducting research on crustaceans (Artemia longinaris), shrimp (Plectieus muelleri), and molluscs (Chlamys spp., Mytilus spp., and Ostrea).
In Bolivia the University G.R. Moreno of Santa Cruz and the Universidad Mayor de San Simón have concentrated their research on surveys of the local aquatic biotic resources and on capture-based fisheries.
In Brazil research in aquaculture is widespread with participation by public and government institutions as well as universities. Until recently research was coordinated by the Superintendencia do Desenvolvimiento da Pesca, but recently it has been assimilated into the Brazilian Environment and Natural Renewable Resources Institute.
As noted in 4.1, Brazil became an early leader in developing aquaculture in the region through expansion of its research and training facilities. Several state universities have made valuable contributions to research through their competent researchers and physical facilities. This includes research in both marine and freshwater environments, and in tropical, sub-tropical, and high altitude zones thus giving broad coverage of conditions and groups of organisms. Some of these universities are the Federal University of Santa Catarina, the Federal University of Ceara, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, of Rio Grande do Sul, and the University of São Paulo. Additionally, other public and private institutions or government agencies that conduct research are the Rio Grande State Agriculture and Livestock Research Centre, Instituto de Pesquisa Agropecuaria de Pernambuco, Superintendencia de Desenvolvimiento Pesqueiro, Compahnia de Desenvolvimiento do Vale do Sao
Francisco, Centro Nacional de Información Agrícola, and CEPTA.
Through the support of AQUILA a publication was edited which contains a complete list of 2 898 references of the ongoing and published aquaculture research projects in Brazil.
In Colombia research has generally focused on the study of native species under the coordination of the Institut Nacional de Recursos Naturales. The Research Centre of Continental Tropical Fisheries of the University of Cordoba has done studies on the polyculture of several native species. The Regional Autonomous Corporations, such as that of Montería, conduct applied research on various topics (e.g. feeding of Prochilodus).
In Costa Rica the Escuela de Ciencias Biológicas of the National University at Heredia, and the Marine and Limnological Science Centre of the University of Costa Rica, focus their research work on the cultivation of molluscs. Both universities provide scientific support to the Aquaculture Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in the applied research conducted at its fish culture stations. The private sector appears to be more active in research than in most other countries of the region.
In Ecuador the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the University of Ecuador is conducting research on different aspects of shrimp culture in an attempt to provide scientific support to the industry. The Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral is also collaborating with the private sector in the solution of technological problems afflicting the industry.
In El Salvador research on aquaculture is the responsibility of the Centro de Desarrollo Pesquero and has centred on the adaptation of culture technologies for subsistence farmers, including evaluation of a polyculture practice based on a native cichlid.
In Mexico research on aquaculture is conducted by both universities and other research institutions, and by the National Fisheries Institute which, in turn, works in collaboration with the Aquaculture Directorate. The scope of research is extensive as it covers over 40 different species of organisms presently under culture. In an attempt to coordinate the activities of approximately 25 institutions involved in basic and applied research, a national committee was created to assign priorities and make recommendations to all parties concerned and organize an annual meeting to present and discuss the progress of its results.
In Panama, as in the rest of the Central American countries, research is almost entirely the responsibility of the Aquaculture Department/Division, as the national universities do not have adequate resources. The Aquaculture Directorate in Panama, through its various experimental aquaculture stations, has conducted a wide range of research covering all species presently cultured in the country. This applied research has been the basis upon which extension programmes have been founded. The University of Panama supports some of this research through its better equipped laboratories. At present, the shrimp culture private sector is relying on the Directorate for backstopping research on nutrition and pathology and in exchange provides financial support for the operation of laboratory facilities.
In Paraguay the Aquaculture Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Asunción has only recently started research, as most of its previous activities have been involved with providing training and extension services.
In Peru research on aquaculture is the responsibility of the Marine Institute and of several universities among which the most active are the National Agrarian University of La Molina, through its Fish Culture Department, and the Veterinarian Tropical High Altitude Research Institute of Pucallpa. The former conducts research in marine aquaculture, trout, and on the use of waste waters for aquaculture among other subjects, while the latter works mostly on the adaptation of native species to culture conditions. Hatcheries and fish experimental stations provide support to research and extension programmes of the Aquaculture Department of the Ministry of Fisheries.
In Uruguay the Instituto Nacional de Pesca has been conducting research mainly on the cultivation of the native boquichico (Prochilodus nigricans) and on two cat fishes which are attracting attention as potential species for aquaculture (the black catfish, Pseudoplatystoma coruscans, and the bighead catfish, Stendachneridion scripta). Some research is also being conducted on mussels, and on marine and freshwater shrimps.
In Venezuela research on aquaculture has a long tradition and at present, in addition to various government institutions, 9 universities and one technological institute are conducting 51 research projects all coordinated by the Fondo Nacional de Investigaciones Agropecuarias. Some of these institutions are the Universidad de Oriente (with its various stations such as the Centro de Investigaciones Científicas in Boca de Río in Isla Margarita, where research on mullets, pompano, shrimp, and Artemia is conducted), the Universidad de Zulia, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Estación de Investigaciones Marinas de Mochima, Centro Occidental Lisandro Alvarado, Instituto de Tecnología del Mar, Universidad de Los Llanos, Instituto Universitario de Carupano, and the Instituto Universitario de Tecnología de Yaracuy.
4.4 Management of credit
Throughout the region there are a large number of national and agricultural development banks which have been established specifically to provide credit for agricultural and livestock production through loans made directly to farmers. Some, such as the Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica, serve a number of countries in the Central American Common Market (CACM).
A number of agricultural banks (which are invariably associated with the principal national bank) are restricted to certain areas (states), or scale of enterprises (cooperatives, or small businesses). In other cases there are special credit funds, which are again sub-units of the principal banks restricted to certain sectors (industry, minerals, agriculture, etc.). However, most of these organizations now include fish farming and fish production within their brief, and have made loans to the sector.
The following appropriate national and agricultural development banks (excluding funds) exist in Argentina (1), Bolivia (1), Brazil (10), Chile (1), Colombia (2), Costa Rica (3), Ecuador (2), El Salvador (3), Guatemala (2), Guyana (1), Honduras (1), Mexico (2), Nicaragua (1), Panama (2), Paraguay (2), Peru (3), Suriname (1), and Venezuela (1),
In those countries with only small commercial aquaculture sectors one problem in the management of credit for the sector has been the absence of policies which fit the peculiarities of the specific activity. This has been particularly difficult with credit programmes for increasing fish culture among small-holders. Potential borrowers have had little previous contact with the formal banking sector, and policies of the banks do not often permit extended credit based on the collateral available to small-holders (the pond and the livestock). The corporate shrimp farmers, on the other hand, who are more used to banking policies and practices and have collateral (the land beneath the ponds), have used the credit arrangements provided by banks repeatedly.
4.5 Associations of professionals in the region
ALA is the principal association for professionals in the region. It has 1 300 members representing some 200 institutions and companies from 27 countries, and is headquartered in Lima, Peru. ALA has organized a number of technical symposia since 1980. As yet ALA has not affiliated to WAS but this has been considered. However, many professionals in the region are members of WAS in their own right (as at 1987), including 47 from Ecuador, Mexico (17), Panama (13), Brazil (12), Colombia (9), Peru and Venezuela (4), Belize, Chile, and Guatemala (3), El Salvador (2), and Argentina and Nicaragua (1). Similarly many professionals from the region are members of the American Fisheries Society, which has a number of speciality sub-groups some of which are relevant to aquaculture (for example, fish culture and fish diseases).
In at least 10 Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela) national aquaculture associations have been formed by professionals, mostly scientists and technologists. These associations endeavour to meet at least once a year.
Frequently part of the funds needed for these meetings is contributed by governments. During meetings not only technical issues are discussed, but also questions such as the role of aquaculture in the national (or regional) economy.
4.6 Information for professionals
A number of scientific publications are produced by organizations and research centres in the region. The principal scientific journal is "Revista Latinoamericana de Acuicultura". This publication is one of the main outputs of the regional project for aquaculture of OLDEPESCA. It is published in Spanish. Others are "Avea", an information bulletin published by the Asociación Venezolana de Acuicultura (Venezuela), and "Aquarius", a bulletin published by OLDEPESCA from Lima, Peru.
The national councils for scientific and technical research as well as several research institutions (see 4.3) publish their own scientific journals or bulletins, or contribute to other journals on aquaculture. All of these are valuable sources of information for professionals particularly because they originate within the region.
Examples of these publications are "Tecnologica" produced by the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral; "Actas Científicas del INDERENA", Colombia, Divulgación Pesquera; "Anales del Instituto de Biología" and "Anales del Centro de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología" of the National University, Mexico; "Informe Técnicos", Uruguay; "Memorias del Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero", Argentina; "Memorias del Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero", Peru; and "Contribuciones Científicas", Centro de Investigaciones Científicas of the Universidad de Oriente, Venezuela. The "Informativo Chileno de Acuicultura" is sponsored by the Instituto Profesional de Osorno.
ALA has recently started to publish its own two-monthly bulletin "ALA Informativo" which is circulated to its 1 300 members, representing 100 institutions and 100 companies, and is financed by AQUILA.
Professionals are not limited to the publications published in the region and they have access, through personal or library membership and/or subscription, to a considerable volume of information about aquaculture because of their proximity to the North American and Caribbean regions. For example, the Universidad de la Habana, in Cuba, publishes "Ciencias - Investigaciones Marinas", which contains many papers on aquaculture.
There are few interregional publications with the exception of the INFOFISH Marketing Digest, a two-monthly magazine produced in association with INFOPESCA (see 1.6), which occasionally contains articles on aquaculture relevant to the region.
Most scientific and technical professionals are members of WAS, which is based in the USA. The Society has many affiliates, one of which is likely to be ALA, although this has yet to be finalized. Other affiliates are the Caribbean Aquaculture Association, and the Argentinian Aquaculture Association. The affiliates have reciprocal benefits from the parent organization and others, such as the European Aquaculture Society (EAS). WAS publishes the "Journal of the World Aquaculture Society", which is free to members, as well as a Newsletter. Most affiliates produce newsletters. WAS and EAS also produce special volumes on aquaculture technology which are available at reduced rates to members.
Other specialist journals on aquaculture are obtained on subscription. The main journals which deal with the subject are "Aquaculture" (the Netherlands); "Aquaculture and Fisheries Management", "Aquaculture Engineering", "Journal of Fish Biology", and "Journal of Fish Diseases" (UK); "Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences" (Canada); "Progressive Fish Culturist", and "Transactions of the American Fisheries Society" (USA).
The largest source of information for aquaculture professionals is FAO at its headquarters in Rome, Italy. The FAO Fisheries Department produces a series of publications, many of which are relevant to aquaculture. These are Fisheries Reports, Fisheries Technical Papers, and Fisheries Synopses. All titles are categorized and produced regularly. Some documents are free and others are priced.
FAO maintains a database in which aquaculture information can be found. ASFA is an international bibliographic database providing comprehensive coverage of publications on the science, technology, and management of marine and freshwater environments. The database can be searched via terminals and personal computers to retrieval systems in Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the USA. It is also available on compact disc. Aquaculture Abstracts from ASFA are available also in printed form through subscription.
The FAO Fisheries Departmental Library is probably the largest repository of books on fisheries and related topics, many of which are on aquaculture subjects. It also maintains a large serial collection of all subjects related to fish and fisheries from fisheries institutes, government departments, and commercial publishers throughout the world. It also maintains a special collection of documents on a country basis and subject files.
In the region the main sources of aquaculture information are the (departmental) libraries of the universities, but invariably as components of other subjects (fisheries, agriculture, marine biology, etc.). Such is the case, for example, in Brazil, Chile (and in the government library of Corporación de Fomento Pesquero), Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, and Peru (Instituto del Mar and the Fisheries Development Institute).
In recognizing the needs of exchange of information on aquaculture among researchers and professionals, AQUILA instituted a Reference System for Aquaculture Research (SIRIAC) compatible with CARIS/FAO (Current Agricultural Research Information System). National research institutions, individual researchers, libraries and other documentation centres have been invited to submit information on current aquaculture research in order to form the database of this information system compiled in MICRO/CDS/ISI software distributed by Unesco. Initially 6 countries (Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela) participated in this project, although it is envisaged that all other countries of the region will eventually integrate themselves into SIRIAC, which would thus constitute one of the main sources of information for professionals and researchers within the region. Mexico is the designated host for SIRIAC.
4.7 Technical assistance projects in support of national infrastructure
Amongst technical assistance activities at this sub-sectoral level dealing with national infrastructure, support has been directed mainly at research and training in aquaculture technologies.
Aquaculture research has received widespread assistance (both geographically and technically) from the International Foundation for Science (IFS), which is based in Stockholm, Sweden. IFS support usually takes the form of research grants of US$ 10 000-15 000 per project. At present IFS is funding Latin American aquaculture researchers in the following topics (some of which cross-reference): 7 research projects in reproduction of aquatic animals; 13 in nutrition; 6 in the culture of crustaceans; 9 in mollusc culture, and 6 in the culture of seaweeds. These individuals are at institutions in Bolivia (1), Brazil (2), Chile (9), Colombia (1), Costa Rica (2), Mexico (1), Nicaragua (1), Panama (2), Peru (3), and Venezuela (1). Most recipients of IFS grants are at national universities. Their research is basic in nature but usually concerns either a species or a subject of direct relevance to local aquaculture.
USAID has been a substantial source of technical assistance in the region either directly in research, or through post-graduate training in aquaculture at universities in the USA, particularly Auburn University and the University of Rhode Island. Currently USAID continues support for the CRSP project on pond dynamics in El Salvador and, until recently, in Panama. Panama has also been the host of some technical courses funded by USAID.
Since 1986 AQUILA has been funded by the Government of Italy, and implemented by FAO. Its principal objectives are concerned with providing support to priority production areas and to their corresponding promotional structures. AQUILA also aims to strengthen the countries' governmental capabilities in sector planning and policy formulation to foster aquaculture development in the region. The project has also produced and disseminated aquaculture information in the region through the establishment of networks in priority research areas, and in training on priority topics including planning and management. The project is based in Brazil but its activities have covered 19 countries of the region.
CIDA supports the development of information systems and research on regional freshwater fish (nutrition and reproductive physiology) at CEPTA in Pirassununga, Brazil. This work began in association with the FAO Regional Aquaculture Centre but continued after the regional project ended in 1986. IDRC continues to support research and training at Pirassununga. IDRC also supported considerable research on molluscs and marine algae at the Catholic University in its Marine Research Station of Las Cruzes in Chile. The IDRC maintains a regional network of aquaculture institutions based in Colombia which coordinates technical assistance activities and research projects.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Netherlands is assisting in the prefeasibility study of commercial shrimp culture in Costa Rica, and in fish culture (colossomids) in Panama and the Dominican Republic. UNDP is assisting Mexico in the development of national planning in the sector and in training. FAO, through its Technical Cooperation Programme, is assisting Suriname in the development of shrimp farming in coastal areas.
GTZ continues to support research on oyster and mussel culture at the Universidad Austral de Chile, at Valdivia.
JICA has supported considerable research in aquaculture in Chile, initially through the joint Chile/JICA programme for salmon enhancement, but subsequently in a range of fields. Much of this has been through government research centres, but also at the Universidad del Norte at Coquimbo.
ODA is continuing to provide support to the region through several training programmes and through joint research and development projects, mainly in Bolivia and Mexico.
A programming meeting on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries in Aquaculture for Latin America and the Caribbean, sponsored by UNDP in collaboration with the Latin American Economic System (SELA) and OLDEPESCA, has recently been held (June 1989). Through this event, 4 priority areas of horizontal cooperation in aquaculture among 19 countries were established. In this meeting 9 training courses, 52 technical assistance activities, 27 agreements on the exchange of species, and 11 joint projects of regional interest, respectively, were negotiated by the authorized representatives of all the participating countries and an agreement was reached to request financial assistance from bilateral and international donor agencies. In addition to the IDB, institutions and governments of Cameroon, Canada, China, Hungary, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia indicated their interest and willingness to cooperate with the region according to their own capabilities.
4.8 Capital assistance
Bilateral agencies (particularly CIDA and IDRC from Canada, and USAID from the USA) mostly provide capital assistance to the region through technical equipment (and some outdoor ponds), particularly to the established aquaculture research centres managed by the public sector. Little if any capital assistance has been given to constructing infrastructure, particularly at training institutions where support has often been conditional (and particularly for multilateral assistance) on the host governments providing all funds for physical infrastructure.
One exception is JICA which has provided construction capital (US$ 5 million) for a new research complex of laboratories and hatchery for the Universidad del Norte at Coquimbo in the La Serena region. It has also supplied research vessels for aquaculture work, and fully equipped the laboratories. JICA is also providing about US$ 5 million for the construction of an aquaculture training and trout culture centre in Bolivia.
In the last decade more capital assistance for research has probably been provided to countries of Central America than to South America.
The IDB contributed to the expansion of Panama's Enrique Ensenat Research Centre in Aguadulce, including additional ponds, an improved water supply system, a hatchery, nutrition research facilities, and an expanded chemical laboratory. Panama has also constructed a research station with the assistance of the Taiwan Development Agency.

5.1 Government policy
Latin American governments see aquaculture as another means of accomplishing policy objectives normally assigned to capture fisheries. In addition to the principal objective of establishing an economically viable and self-sustaining sector (the goal of the Ministry of Finance or its equivalent), aquaculture (according to the Ministry in charge of government policy for the sector) is expected to contribute to low-cost food production and employment..
In 1979 these objectives were endorsed by the Committee of Sea and Fresh Water Products, a unit established by SELA. The Committee stated that in Latin America aquaculture should:
(i) produce food readily available to Latin American populations;
(ii) provide employment for large numbers of manual workers;
(iii) contribute to a rational exploitation of the region's natural resources.
Since that meeting these national objectives have been modified by the governments of several countries. Many now also see aquaculture as a means of earning hard currency through the export of high-value products, such as shrimps, molluscs, and salmon.
Following the FAO-sponsored Aquaculture Symposium held in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1974, and the Regional Meeting for Planning of Aquaculture held in Caracas, Venezuela in 1975, many countries have recognized the need to formulate their own policies and sector plans for the development of aquaculture. However, as yet, not all government policies and objectives have been translated into documented aquaculture development plans. In some way this may be a reflection of the difficulty of reconciling conflicting economic and sectoral demands on national resources, such as coastal sites, water, feed ingredients, etc., as well as issues which might require land reform. Furthermore, as national plans require budgetary commitments, governments of the region have few financial resources to commit. In addition, most government organizations responsible for aquaculture have formulated departmental plans concerning their own operations and activities reflecting their policies toward
aquaculture development.
Without financial commitment and endorsement by the national planning authority the majority of plans for aquaculture development have become, in practice, programmes attempting to introduce aquaculture practices to different areas of the country and under the different existing developmental schemes. In the best of cases they have set useful goals for production once aquaculture has been successfully introduced. However, due to the limitations imposed by the institutional and structural characteristics of the government body or organization responsible for their formulation and implementation, such programmes and/or goals have excluded many social and economic factors required by a national sector development plan. Consequently, so far, little has been achieved.
In recent years, in accordance with the importance attributed to aquaculture in almost every country, more coherent and structured policies and plans have been formulated, allocating more resources for development. National priorities have dictated selection of objectives in terms of (1) increasing food production for domestic consumption; (2) creation of employment opportunities for the rural population; (3) rational utilization and exploitation of natural resources to increase the standard of living of the rural population; and (4) earn foreign currency through the exportation of aquatic products.
The extent of government policies as well as the strategies for their development vary among the different countries of the region. They reflect their political, social, and economic characteristics, as well as the state of development of the sector itself. Planning procedures for the aquaculture sector seem to have been adapted from those which had previously been instituted at higher levels of public administration (for example, in Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela) while in other countries, planning of the aquaculture sector has been introduced simultaneously at all levels of the public administration (for example, in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico). In both cases difficulties seem to be resolved gradually as experience is gained in the application and adaptation of planning laws (overcoming excessively rigid and inflexible mechanisms), through accumulated knowledge, and with training of staff in the areas of planning and management.
Governments have recognized that aquaculture development requires in-depth planning supporting promotion, and coordination with other production sectors. However, there are significant variations between countries in the institutional strength of the government organization responsible for aquaculture, budgetary commitment, and training and research programmes in support of the local and national infrastructure. Some countries have an integrated and realistic policy of management of credit for specific target groups, a well-coordinated programme of extension, an adequate supply of inputs and services, and a well-oriented marketing scheme.
Argentina does not have a national development plan, and provides limited support to producers, either through its institutions or by means of credit and other fiscal incentives.
Although Bolivia does not yet have a national development plan, its 1987-90 Fisheries Development Plan states as objectives the technical enhancement of fish farming and the strengthening of research as a means to increase production of natural fish resources.
Sector planning of aquaculture in Chile is not carried out at the government level. Development has been entirely in the hands of the private sector and developmental institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) within the scheme of the social market economy of the country.
Colombia has not had an explicit policy for development. The various national development plans of the past two decades have not been consistent with development to allow coordination of actions in terms of adoption of species and technologies, integration of international technical assistance projects, and structuring of a sector plan. It was not until 1980 that a Plan for Marine Science and Technology Research was finally drawn up from which, in 1985, the National Plan on Fisheries and Aquaculture Research was derived and which in turn has provided the basis for a National Aquaculture Development Programme, at present under preparation.
In Guatemala policies for development are implicitly contemplated in the General Strategies and Basis for the Development of the Agricultural Sector, which include both the promotion of rural aquaculture and coastal shrimp aquaculture. However, a specific sector programme has never been formulated.
In Honduras the 1987-90 National Development Plan refers to aquaculture as a means of obtaining inexpensive protein sources for the population and of generating foreign currency through the exportation of shrimp. But there is no specific sector development programme which provides adequate support for its implementation.
Although a National Plan for the Development of Aquaculture had been prepared since 1975 in Costa Rica, the Government did not support it, purportedly despite the recognition of its importance in the 1986-90 National Development Plan. The lack of a proper sector framework analysis is an impediment to the concrete and thorough application of the plan. None the less, some advances in this respect make Costa Rica one of the most progressive countries in institutional planning of aquaculture as results of its research, extension, incentives, and marketing programmes demonstrate.
In Panama, in spite of the lack of a documented national plan, the Government has been consistent in application of its policies. For the last 15 years the National Directorate for Aquaculture has been very active in promoting the development of the sector with a comprehensive and well-coordinated plan of action.
Until 1976, efforts to promote the development of aquaculture in Mexico were sporadic and dispersed throughout the public administration. This changed following the creation of a National Directorate of Aquaculture, under the Fisheries Department. However, the first effective plan of action was implemented much later. The present National Aquaculture Programme is a well-structured planning instrument which is starting to produce the desired results of not only significantly increasing total production, but also accomplishing social and economic goals through more and better coordinated participation of government organizations which support the sector.
In Venezuela aquaculture is a priority under the National Development Plan (VI Plan de la Nación). As such the Council for Scientific Research elaborated a sector framework analysis for its development. A National Aquaculture Programme is being drafted and it is expected that it will be officially approved before the end of this year. As of now the Ministry of the Environment and Renewable Resources still has some participation in the control of activities, having dictated stringent measures on the granting of authorizations for the introduction of exotic species into the country which has limited its development. The new National Programme is expected to help overcome this and other bottlenecks still afflicting the industry.
An important consideration with respect to government policy toward aquaculture is that most governments set national programme goals based on the expectation that rural, small-scale aquaculture was capable of producing surpluses which would enter normal marketing channels and would contribute to national food production (especially when integrated with agricultural activities). Thus many have provided full public organizational support (for seed, technical assistance, and subsidies, etc.). Unfortunately, results and experience throughout the region so far have shown that rural, small-scale aquaculture has not gained a momentum of its own.
5.2 Government organization
Within the appropriate ministry aquaculture is usually designated as a Departamento, Dirección General, or Sub-secretaría. Staff have the responsibility of establishing policies and directions for development of the sector, as well as liaison with other appropriate departments where there is a sharing of common resources (for example, land and water-use).
Such is the case of Argentina where freshwater aquaculture falls under the Dirección Nacional de Pesca Continental and marine production under the Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero, both dependant of the Sub-secretaría de Pesca of the Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Pesca (Ministry of Economy). This structure was created in 1985. The Directorate has administrative and restocking responsibilities, while the Institute undertakes supporting research for fishery programmes, including aquaculture.
In Bolivia aquaculture is administered by the Centro de Desarrollo Pesquero created in 1984 under the Ministry of Peasant and Agricultural Affairs. Its functions include the planning of fishery development, scientific and technological research, promotion of rural peasant organization, and the regulation and control of fishery activities including overseeing fiscal matters. The Government is seeking assistance for institutional strengthening. The Centre also offers economic incentives for production in the way of fingerlings, construction, technical assistance, etc., although present economic constraints limit its functions.
In Chile the Servicio Nacional de Pesca is the executive arm of the Sub-secretaría de Pesca (Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Reconstrucción) with responsibilities for fisheries resources. However, the Corporación de Fomento de la Producción is an autonomous entity within Government with internal financing for development, and supports aquaculture. The Instituto de Fomento is the research arm for the Corporation and carries out scientific and technical work on aquaculture. Aquaculture is also supported in Chile by two quasi-government organizations, namely ProChile, which markets national production, and Fundación Chile, which supports research and development.
In Colombia the Instituto de Desarrollo de los Recursos Renovables under the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the promotion and development of aquaculture, and is expected to assume an administrative role as well through the Dirección de Acuicultura. However, the lack of funding constrains its activities, which are also not entirely independent from those of 7 other Ministries, the National Planning Department, and the Presidency of the country.
In Costa Rica aquaculture is under the General Directorate of Fishery Resources and Aquaculture (Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock). The Department of Aquaculture, created in 1974, has promoted fish farming within the framework of the draft of the National Plan for the Development of Aquaculture. This task has been accomplished mainly through the implementation of rural aquaculture projects and through the creation of several fish culture and research stations. In 1984 the Department was assigned technical, scientific, and administrative tasks to enforce the then current legislation in relation to the exploitation of aquatic resources and aquaculture. In 1989 a National Aquaculture Sector Plan has been sanctioned by which national policies and the respective plan of action for the promotion and development of aquaculture are identified and defined. The Dirección de Acuicultura is expected to receive full support from the National Agriculture Council and from the
Executive Secretariat of the Agriculture Sectoral Planning in accomplishing its promotional and regulatory tasks. It will also participate in the revision and updating of legislative measures related to aquaculture.
In Ecuador the Sub-secretaría de Recursos Pesqueros of the Ministry of Natural and Energy Resources is responsible for managing, regulating, and executing national policies for the development of aquaculture. The General Directorate of Fisheries, the National Fisheries Institute (in charge of research), the Fisheries School of Manta (middle level training), and the National Fisheries Corporation (marketing) participate in the promotion and development of aquaculture at the national level.
In El Salvador the Centro de Desarrollo Pesquero is responsible for the aquaculture sector. Its functions are exclusively regulatory, while all operations are under the Agricultural Regional Authorities. This institutional structure prevents it from having direct authority over extension and promotion personnel, and thus the country lacks an effective mechanism for the support and control of the sector.
In Guatemala aquaculture falls under the Dirección Tecnica de Pesca y Acuicultura of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Feeding. It is a branch of the Livestock Services Directorate and its functions are severely limited by the shortage of personnel and resources for its operation.
The Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in Guyana is the government agency responsible for aquaculture promotion and development. This Department has as its mission to manage, regulate, and promote exploitation and development of the nation's fishery resources. With regard to aquaculture it has been seeking over the years to foster development through research, extension, and training activities. Its activities are conducted at the Botanic Gardens Fish Culture Station which also produces broodstock and fingerlings for is development programmes. Regional Administrations run two other stations at Supenaam and at Pomerroon. Promotion of aquaculture is closely linked with the activities conducted by the Guyana Sugar Corporation as part of its diversification programme which receives financial assistance from IDRC, and with the Department of Biology of the University of Guyana.
Officially the responsibility for aquaculture in Honduras is under the General Directorate for Natural Renewable Resources of the Ministry of Natural Resources. However, in practice, several other institutions are involved in the administrative and promotional aspects of the activity. In recognizing this situation an inter-institutional Committee for the Development of Aquaculture has been created in an attempt to coordinate the promotional and administrative measures undertaken by the different agencies involved.
In Mexico the National Directorate for Aquaculture, within the Secretaría de Pesca is the main government body responsible for the aquaculture sector, and as such is the designated agency for the implementation of the National Aquaculture Programme. However, neither culture-based fisheries fall directly under the Directorate nor does research, which is the main task of the National Fisheries Institute. Although the Secretaría has delegations or representative offices in most states of the country, some state governments have independent fisheries and aquaculture departments which do not necessarily abide by federal regulations. None the less the country possesses an effective organization for the execution of developmental aquaculture policies as well as for the coordination and regulation of the activity among the different institutions and organizations participating in aquaculture promotion, research, finance, and support to the industry. In recent years the Directorate
has received considerable assistance (from AQUILA, and UNDP/FAO) for institutional strengthening in planning and public management. In close collaboration with the National Fisheries Institute, the Directorate is assisting the cooperative sector in the expansion of the shrimp farming industry as well as to the rural sector in promoting freshwater aquaculture.
After a transition period of administrative reorganization in Nicaragua, the Aquaculture Directorate was created in 1984 within the Nicaraguan Fisheries Institute, which had already centralized regulation, research, and development of the fishery and aquaculture resources. The economic, productive, and administrative transformation of the country led to the formation of corporations of those government institutions directly involved in production. Thus in 1988 the Institute became the National Fishery Corporation with the aim of attaining economic autonomy. Priorities in the development of aquaculture have moved toward the creation of a viable economic sector based mainly on shrimp farming as opposed to traditional rural subsistence fish farming practices. Therefore, the Fishery Corporation is in the process of formulating a development programme with specific policies and strategies in order to achieve its objectives effectively.
In Panama, since 1976, the National Aquaculture Directorate of the Agriculture Development Ministry has been in charge of the implementation of the country's policies toward the aquaculture sector as dictated by the National Development Plan. The lack of a National Aquaculture Programme has not impeded it from conducting an active scheme for the development of the sector at all levels. Through a sound but flexible internal organization, it maintains an active role in extension, research, promotion, regulation, and control, in both the rural and industrial sectors.
In Paraguay aquaculture falls under the Dirección de Caza, Pesca y Piscicultura of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, but at the lowest hierarchical level. In spite of the fact that its internal organic law designates this Directorate to be responsible for aquaculture, the lack of human and economic resources impede the execution of its corresponding functions. In practice, the Fish Farming Division of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences at the National University of Asunción is the main promoter of aquaculture throughout the country.
The Ministry of Fisheries of Peru is the government organization responsible for aquaculture through the newly created General Directorate for Aquaculture. The Ministry has regional representations which oversee its operations within their own jurisdiction. The Ministry has as its functions the formulation of policies and development plans as well as the regulation, evaluation, control, and promotion of their implementation. The Instituto del Mar provides scientific and technological support to the Aquaculture Directorate in its promotion activities.
In Uruguay the Instituto Nacional de la Pesca is responsible for the administration of the sector, and falls under the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture. Its functions are to advise, promote, develop, and control the national fisheries and aquaculture activities, both public and private.
In Suriname aquaculture falls under the State Commission for Fisheries. The interest for aquaculture gained momentum toward 1983 when a Government Limited Company (Surland) was created with financial assistance from the OAS. Surland has been the government's main instrument for the promotion of aquaculture through the construction of institutional infrastructure, and the execution of development programmes. The Commission, with the assistance of FAO, is building a pilot demonstration farm for shrimp culture as a means of encouraging private entities to invest in this sector, and to serve as a training centre.
In Venezuela the General Sectorial Directorate of Fisheries and Aquaculture, of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, is in charge of overseeing aquaculture promotion in the country. Through its Aquaculture Division, it is formulating a development programme as a means of enhancing the contribution of this sector to total food production in the country. The National Trust Fund for Agricultural Research is collaborating in the execution of a technical development programme which includes transfer of technology in the field of aquaculture and which is expected to aid the Directorate in the accomplishment of its goals.
5.3 Aquaculture legislation
All Latin American countries appear to have some legislation which makes it possible for the appropriate administration to manage the aquaculture sector. It also appears that legislation which applies to export-oriented aquaculture is more enacted, more precise, and better enforced than that which applies to traditional and rural fish culture. This means that producers engaged in the farming of shrimp, molluscs, and salmon have to comply with more regulations than those who produce freshwater fish for household consumption or local markets. This is probably a reflection of the fact that it was possible, until relatively recently, to practise small-scale pond culture without significant competition for land and water.
In most countries it is now necessary to obtain one or more permits to install and operate aquaculture production units, and possibly from central authorities as well as local government councils, or equivalent institutions.
Most countries have legislation for the control of importation of exotic or non-indigenous species to be used in aquaculture (or introduced in open waters), and protocols for the transfer and introduction of species to countries in the region have been discussed by members of OLDEPESCA and the Commission for Inland Fisheries of Latin America (COPESCAL) (see 6.2). This legislation is difficult to enforce and has, in some countries, been circumvented. In Central America movements of non-indigenous species between countries are quite common.
It is not common for national legislation to reserve natural resources for certain sections of population. However, in Mexico commercial aquaculture activities involving eight of the higher-valued species are reserved exclusively for members of cooperative societies.
Aquaculture legislation and regulations are largely disorganized throughout the region. This constrains its development as it is not always capable of satisfying conflicting demands posed by various categories of producers. This often causes irregularities in the application of laws and regulations (thus taking action and control out of the hands of the designated authorities), and conflicts concerning the use of the various resources used by aquaculture (e.g. land, water resources, fishing rights, and economic funds) cannot always be resolved as dictated by their respective laws.
The legal framework for aquaculture is heterogenous within the countries of the region. In some cases it barely touches upon the sector, while in others it is vast and complex, especially when different laws are applicable to this one single sector. In many cases the only existing laws refer to fisheries in general, and therefore government administrative organizations have to infer or extrapolate when dealing with aquaculture. National Aquaculture Development Programmes cannot always be carried out in part due to the limitations imposed by current legislation formulated for sectors other than aquaculture, but because of the complex nature of this activity it necessarily infringes upon those of other sectors (such as agriculture, forestry, livestock, tourism, and environmental protection).
Legislation for aquaculture in Argentina is non-existent, although some provinces (Chubut, Rio Negro) have local laws applicable to the exploitation of aquatic organisms through aquaculture. These laws attempt to stimulate investment in the sector by ensuring rights for a prolonged period of time. Additional incentives include technical assistance, loans, legal advice, and sometimes the provision of seedstock. At the national level the National Directorate of Continental Fisheries has prepared a legislation draft in which Articles 11 to 18 address aquaculture permits, water, and other resource user rights.
In Bolivia several legal dispositions refer to fisheries management and control but there is no specific regulation for aquaculture. The 1975 Wildlife, National Parks, Hunting and Fishing Law is applicable to fisheries in general, but is already obsolete. A Fishing and Hydrobiological Resources Law has been drafted and is being discussed in the legislative chamber. This law would fill the existing vacuum concerning the planning and development of aquaculture.
In Chile since 1931 the Fishing Law contemplated the hiring of beaches and maritime space for fish and shellfish farming. In 1960 more specific laws were enacted on maritime concessions, and in 1967 on the establishment and operation of enterprises dedicated to aquaculture. In 1980 a law was approved, Articles 12 to 18 of which refer to aquaculture activities (Decreto Supremo No. 175). Three other decrees (291 of 1985, 99 of 1988 and Resolution 0548 of 1988) are specific to salmon farming, such as the control of salmonid diseases, minimum distance between culture centres and treatment of effluents, and sanitary requirements for the importation of eggs, respectively. Different provinces of the country have their own regulations concerning financial investment and incentives, tax deductions, subsidies, and customs duties, all having the intention of attracting investment capital.
In Colombia several decrees have been emitted amending the 1938 Law which legislated on different fisheries matters. These decrees refer to various forms of aquatic exploitation (1954, 1957, 1959, 1974, 1978) but it was not until 1974 when more specific regulations concerning aquaculture were approved. The activity is mostly legislated by decrees (hydrobiological resources: 1974, 1978; water: 1961, 1973, 1984; land: 1971, 1986; foreign trade: 1985; credit: 1979, 1983, 1984; permits for industrial activities: 1978). The Foreign Trade Institute regulates importation and exportation of inputs and products for fisheries and aquaculture. Regional Corporations and the Agrarian Rural Reform regulate concessions of land for aquaculture.
In Costa Rica only a few articles of the Fisheries and Forestry Law touch upon aquaculture, and only coastal shrimp farming requires authorization by local municipalities, the Tourism Institute, and the Forestry Directorate (only in cases where mangrove forests are affected). Importation of seedstock is regulated by Animal Quarantine of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. Capture of wild seed or stock is in turn regulated by the Environmental Protection Department or by the Wildlife Directorate. The Government has no economic incentive schemes for aquaculture development, although recently it has requested the National Economic Council to approve a fund of over US$ 2 million for aquaculture loans.
In Ecuador several decrees and resolutions have superseded the Law of Fisheries and Development of 1974 in an attempt to harmonize the conflicting interests of aquaculture activities. A specific regulation for aquaculture designates the Ministry of Natural and Energy Resources as the agency in charge of management, execution, supervision, and control of rules and regulations concerning the sector, and to seek financial assistance for the artisanal producers.
The 1981 General Law of Fishery Activities regulates the promotion and development of both fisheries and aquaculture in El Salvador. This instrument is precise in terms of the definition of aquaculture, the required permits, and on the administration of the activity. However, some decrees have been emitted a posteriori in parallel with the evolution of marine shrimp farming. Land resources for this last activity are regulated by the Forestry Law.
In view of the obsolesence of the Fishing Law of Guatemala, in 1983 a decree was approved in which procedures to request permits, the control of species introductions, and inspection of aquaculture activities are regulated. However, a number of aspects related to aquaculture were excluded from that decree. A Fishery and Aquaculture Law is at present under revision, which should provide adequate coverage in terms of legislation of this sector.
In Honduras the need for an appropriate aquaculture legislative framework has been recognized by the National Development Plan as producers encounter many obstacles from present legislation. Several agencies intervene in the regulation of aquaculture, hindering its development. On the other hand, although credit/loans for aquaculture in Honduras are available through various channels, they are seldom allocated because of the lack of proper investment feasibility studies.
The legal framework for aquaculture in Mexico includes several laws, the main one within the sector being the Federal Fisheries Law of 1986. However, the various other laws regulating resources, land tenure, water rights, environmental protection, had, until recently, constituted a major bottleneck to development. In recognizing this legal constraint, a Committee involving five Ministries and other agencies has been formed to review and propose a mechanism to facilitate the required permit process by would-be producers, regardless of the type of venture. This coordination should lead to the use of a single permit format, and obviate the need to replicate application before each Ministry concerned.
The same Federal Fisheries Law grants the cooperative societies the exclusive right to exploit (either through fisheries or aquaculture) eight of the highest-valued aquatic species, provided they meet the required technical, administrative, and financial capabilities to undertake such exploitation.
National development banks have instituted specific regulations concerning the granting of loans and credit for aquaculture, setting priorities according to the type of species to be exploited. Given the economic constraints afflicting the country, the government has no specific provisions for economic and tributary incentives to attract investment in the sector. The National Agricultural Insurance Government Agency has included aquaculture production under its coverage policies as a means of protecting aquaculture investors.
The Organic Law of 1984 is the legislative framework which provides the Instituto Nacional de Pesca of Nicaragua the capability to assign areas of exploitation for aquaculture, as well as to grant permits and to promote the development of the sector. A specific law for shrimp culture is being drafted in anticipation of this industry.
In Panama the legal framework of aquaculture is constituted by numerous decrees and resolutions as there is a single specific law regulating the sector. Land use is regulated by the Treasury, water use by the Law of Waters, and environmental protection by the Ministry of Health. Several Ministries and agencies participate in the approval of permits for aquaculture production, exacerbating the complex process of meeting all specified requirements contained in the following decrees: Law No. 35, 1963; Decree No. 58, 1964; Decree No. 70, 1968; Law No. 21, 1974; Decree No. 3, 1983. Duties and taxes on land, production, and exportation, are also regulated by various decrees.
Paraguay does not have a Fisheries Law, although the National Constitution dictates that the state has the obligation to preserve its forestry and natural renewable resources. Thus the Civil Codex approves the private appropriation of the fisheries resources of the country. There is no regulation concerning aquaculture, and non-sectoral legislative measures do not appear to impose any restriction on the development of aquaculture.
The General Law of Fisheries of Peru provides a legal definition of aquaculture and specifies requirements for granting permits. Several regulations refer to specific aspects of aquaculture, others refer to the preservation of resources, and others provide incentives for development.
A decree approves regulations on mollusc culture, another approves regulations for exploitation and marketing of ornamental aquatic resources, and a third approves regulations for exploitation of seaweeds. The Ministry of Fisheries has the faculty to grant rights on coastal areas, water areas, or marine bottoms for aquaculture production. Rights for inland aquaculture are granted by this same Ministry in coordination with the Provincial Municipal Councils and with the Ministry of Agriculture. Several tax deduction, location, and export economic incentives are regulated by different decrees and laws. No price controls are imposed on aquaculture products, and production activities carried out by individuals are exempted from all taxes and duties.
In Uruguay there is no specific legal framework for aquaculture, and only few regulations in relation to land tenure and water use are directly relevant to the sector.
In Venezuela the Fisheries Law does not refer to, or regulate, the aquaculture sector. However there is a specific resolution (1980) regulating and controlling the exploitation of mussels which obliges the producer to obtain a special permit to culture them and a sanitary license to market them, thus ensuring that products are free from toxins produced by red tides. Some other resolutions also affect the aquaculture sector as they forbid the introduction and cultivation of tilapias (1974). Permits must be obtained to introduce certain penaeid and Macrobrachium species (1984, 1988). The Ministry of the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources is responsible for authorizing all aquaculture operations. Some other laws concerning the use of land, environmental protection, agrarian reform, sanitary quality, and fisheries may be applicable to certain aspects of aquaculture production.
A number of countries impose import duties, sales taxes, and other charges on the sale or purchase of equipment and other inputs used by commercial producers. This reflects the needs of either the economy as a whole or of large groups of producers/consumers. The same applies to export and/or production incentives; these are usually economy-wide and are not specifically for aquaculture producers. Peru is an example. All items of equipment needed in hatcheries are free of import duties and other imposed charges, and all exports of non-traditional products (including aquaculture products) receive a "Certex"; for cultured finfish this is 28% of export earnings and for cultured shrimps it is 35% (f.o.b. price).
As a means of attracting foreign investment in Guyana, companies which export outside the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are allowed to keep 20% of their export earnings in hard currency. In Venezuela aquaculture products are classified under agricultural products, and are exempt from income tax.
In Ecuador the government provides low-interest loans for both farms and hatcheries and theoretically allows the hatcheries to import some equipment duty-free, although application may be a time consuming process. However, despite these efforts to promote the shrimp farming industry, restrictions imposed after 1982 on the conversion of export earnings diverted millions of dollars from the industry. Exporters earned bonuses, but they did not make up for the lost earnings because of the difference between the official and free-market exchange rates. After these restrictions were eliminated illegal practices have declined as the exporters have been allowed to convert dollar earnings at the free market rate which in turn has resulted in a major new infusion of capital to the industry. Private investors have also been encouraged by the Government's decision to decontrol interest rates.
5.4 Trade and business associations
In addition to the associations of professionals in the region already mentioned (see 4.5) there are other associations the character of which is essentially commercial. These are mainly constituted by producers rather than researchers or public administration officers. Some private associations have become involved in aquaculture production. For example, in Costa Rica the Association of Banana Producers began experimenting with freshwater prawns in 1976 and currently operates a hatchery and commercial farm. The Trout Farmers' Association of Dota operates a hatchery with the support of the University of Guelph (Canada) for the supply of fingerlings to members.
The Brazil Aquaculture Association groups many medium and large-scale commercial producers and facilitates the exchange of information on technical, managerial, and national policy matters concerning the sector. There is also a Frog Producers' Association of Goiana which meets annually and publishes a bulletin to provide technical information to its associate members.
In Chile, the ProChile organization supports national exports through international promotion, and includes commodities (salmon and shellfish) from the aquaculture industry.
In Colombia the Industrial National Association has a Committee which associates the shrimp producers of the Caribbean coast. The National Aquaculture Association is formed by trout farmers and by the Pacific shrimp producers. Locally the trout farmers of other provinces of Huila have formed their own association. The National Board of Coffee Producers is also now involved in aquaculture according to its diversification policies, and has also become an important trade association.
The Chamber of Shrimp Producers of Ecuador has over 120 members, many of whom are among the largest shrimp farmers of the country.
In Mexico the National Federation of Cooperative Societies is the main trade association in shrimp and oyster culture, as the Fisheries Law reserves these species exclusively to cooperative societies. The Mexican Aquaculture Association also acts as a trade association as most producers are affiliated. The National Fisheries Industry Chamber is gaining importance as an aquaculture trade association as some members have also associated into cooperative societies to be entitled to become shrimp producers.
Shrimp producers in Peru have also associated themselves into a consortium with the specific object of gaining access to loans and credits. Over 40 companies have thus formed the Industrial Shrimp Farmers' Consortium.
5.5 Information resources for management
There are few, if any, resources of information for management produced in the region. There are a number of newsletters which contain a range of information for all levels of the sector, such as "Acuicultura", produced by the FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean for the aquaculture network; "ALA Informativa", "AQUARIUS" and "Revista Latinoamericana de Acuicultura", INFOPESCA and INFOFISH International, and "Aquaculture Digest" (see 1.6 and 4.6).
Some of AQUILA's publications contain information relevant to national infrastructure as one of its main activities is to create a framework for planning and management of sectors in the region.
Through its newsletter "Aquaculture Minutes" and several other relevant publications, ADCP is rapidly becoming a valuable information resource for management in the region.
The most important management circular, which at times has relevance for aquaculture in the region, is "Eurofish Report". This is a two-weekly review of European and world fishing and fisheries, with comprehensive coverage of EEC legislation and the Common Fisheries Policy. It usually contains some information about aquaculture, including EEC grants and loans, legislation, new investments, joint-ventures, and supplies and prices.
5.6 Technical assistance projects for national infrastructure
At this level there have been few technical assistance projects for strengthening administration of the sector, or for directly developing national policies and plans. At the present time Mexico is receiving assistance from the FAO Technical Cooperation Programme for national planning. There has been much indirect assistance. Bilateral and multilateral agencies (through education and study tours in aquaculturally-developed countries) have included government administrators in projects to provide opportunities for knowledge to identify and implement national aquaculture policies and plans, or used project resources to strengthen the capabilities of national administrators to manage public resources required by the sector.
More direct help has come from regional projects. AQUILA, funded by the Government of Italy and executed by FAO, is providing countries of the region with the basis for national development plans, and for obtaining technical and capital assistance. AQUILA is directing and partly financing national studies of the aquaculture sector in all Latin American countries. The basic studies were finalized in the first quarter of 1989, and subsequently published. This effort was helped by the ADCP which provided guideline documents for planning and sector surveys.
During the first half of the 1980s the Latin American Regional Aquaculture Centre based at Pirassununga in Brazil, which was funded by UNDP and the Government of Italy and implemented by FAO, provided multidisciplinary training for aquaculturists with university backgrounds. The year-long course was aimed at providing senior public sector aquaculturists with the knowledge to identify and implement national aquaculture plans.

6. REGIONAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT
6.1 United Nations organizations in the region
6.2 Other organizations in the region
6.3 Economic communities in the region
6.4 Regional and global aquaculture development projects
6.1 United Nations organizations in the region
The countries of the region are active in a number of organizations in which aquaculture is regarded as a sector, either individually or as a component of a larger sector such as fisheries or agriculture, and which receives support in some form. The principal regional organization is the United Nations in which all countries (with the exception of Chile) actively participate as member states.
Most of the countries are members and participate in the activities of the specialized organizations and agencies of the UN system. Those which have substantial records of providing technical and capital assistance to the sector world-wide are the UNDP, the FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Bank in affiliation with the International Development Association and the International Finance Corporation.
UNDP has offices in Argentina, Guatemala, Guyana, Paraguay, and Venezuela; and both UNDP and FAO have offices in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, and Uruguay. Belize shares the FAO office with Mexico. FAO's Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Santiago, Chile.
Other UN organizations support the sector through projects directed at other objectives; for example, the United Nations Children's Fund has worked in Peru; Unesco has financed fellowships for training and short-term research; the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has been concerned with trade and export of aquaculture products and regulating tariffs between countries; and the World Health Organization (WHO) has supported research at agriculture centres with have relevance to fish culture. One agency, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean is there to collaborate with the regional governments in the investigation and analysis of economic problems, and provides guidance in the formulation of development plans, often in cooperation with other UN agencies.
6.2 Other organizations in the region
The IDB has been the predominant organization providing capital assistance to the aquaculture sector in the region. The IDB is based in Washington DC, USA, and has 43 members from, and outside, the region. The IDB has been a prolific lender to the sector either directly or as a component of a larger programme. Almost US$ 20 million was loaned to the sector up to 1984, and considerably more since then, including, for example, US$ 4 million to Peru for production of shellfish.
Belize is the only member of the Commonwealth and is also one of three Caribbean states (with Guyana and Suriname) adhering to the Lome Convention of the European Community. Both organizations have been active in their support to aquaculture, although not specifically in the region.
Most countries of the region are members of the OAS, which is based in Washington DC, USA. The OAS has several specialized bodies which have relevance to the sector (Cooperation on Agriculture, Statistics, etc.) but little has been done so far.
Through FAO a number of regional commissions exist which are directly involved in fisheries. These are based at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy. COPESCAL has 20 members (of which 17 are from the region as described) to promote, coordinate, and assist national and regional fishery and limnological surveys, and programmes of research and development, leading to the rational utilization of inland fishery resources. It specifically assists the development of aquaculture, and has formed a Working Party on Aquaculture which meets regularly to discuss regional cooperation and technical issues in the sector. The Regional Fisheries Advisory Commission for the Southwest Atlantic, with only Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay as members, is involved in both marine and inland resources; and the Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission, which has 30 members from within (11) and outside the region, is active in conservation, development, and utilization of the living resources of the
Western Central Atlantic, especially shrimps.
SELA, based in Caracas, Venezuela, allows regional consultation and cooperation in economic and social progress, chiefly through the creation of regional enterprises. Fish products and technology are specifically identified as activities, and SELA supports an aquaculture project through the Action Committee for Marine and Freshwater Production (CAPMAD), (see 6.4).
6.3 Economic communities in the region
The region of Latin America as described by this survey includes countries of both Central America and South America, and extends over a wide area divisible into smaller geo-political sub-regions. The countries described by this survey are therefore members of a number of economic groups.
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela are members of the Andean Group. Chile, an original member, withdrew in 1977. The Group aims to accelerate the harmonious development of member states through economic and social integration, and has activities which establish sub-regional development programmes in agriculture (among other sectors), especially improving food technology. The headquarters of the Group is in Lima, Peru.
Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua are members of CACM. CACM, which is based in Guatemala City, Guatemala, was established to liberalize interregional trade and establish free trade areas and customs union. Two of its nine departments are concerned with agriculture, and science and technology, but so far with nothing relevant to either fisheries or aquaculture.
Belize and Guyana are two of the 13 members of CARICOM, and Suriname is an observer. CARICOM, which is based in Georgetown, Guyana, was formed in 1973 to foster trade and promote economic integration and cooperation amongst its members. It has a number of activities in agriculture and fisheries, particularly training, and it has submitted plans for a regional aquaculture centre, with the help of FAO, to LOME III/EEC for funding (about US$ 2 million). Formal approval has not yet been given. CARICOM provides loans through the Caribbean Development Bank for investment in the sector through EEC financial assistance.
The Latin American Integration Association, based in Montevideo, Uruguay, has eleven members (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela), and was established in 1980 to replace the Latin American Free Trade Association. Its activities are intended to increase trade between members and promote regional integration, leading in the long-term to a Latin American Common Market.
6.4 Regional and global aquaculture development projects
OLDEPESCA was created by ten countries (Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela, together with Cuba) and is located in Lima, Peru. One of its principal programmes is concerned with regional development of aquaculture, with each member funding national research and the secretariat funding the coordination and interchange of technical personnel and, where necessary, species. Some activities of OLDEPESCA have been supported financially both by UNDP and FAO.
The Government of Italy is providing financial support for regional aquaculture development among the Spanish and Portugese-speaking countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The project, called AQUILA, is executed by FAO. It is based in Brasilia, Brazil. The present phase terminates at the end of 1989. The principal components of the project are the networking of priority research topics, and technical training activities through short-term specialized courses, medium-term courses for government officers, and study tours. Information is the third component, both to support technical development in the sector and national planning.
CAPMAD, an aquaculture action committee for SELA, based in Caracas, Venezuela, has established, through its Project Five, a pilot scale research project in aquaculture. The project also supports training through the exchange of technical personnel, and the publication of an aquaculture review.
ALA, for all intents and purposes, is a regional project. It provides information for scientists and technologists in the sector and, in addition to publications listing members and projects, conducts a number of meetings at which topics of regional importance are reviewed. Its recent collaboration with AQUILA is further strengthening this sector.
The FAO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, from its headquarters in Santiago, Chile, has established an information network for technical cooperation in aquaculture throughout the region. Participants in the network include Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama (and Cuba). In addition to the circulation of a newsletter, the network publishes and distributes information on a variety of topics, including engineering, diseases, culture practices, etc., and assists in planning.
The Permanent Commission for the South Pacific is an organization established by Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru which has organized a number of activities for marine-related aquaculture, such as seminars and meetings, and also provides financial assistance for specific technical studies.
Finally, UNDP created the ADCP in support of global initiatives in aquaculture. Its activities, from FAO in Rome, Italy, have extended into Latin America (with the instigation of the regional aquaculture programme in Brazil, noted above), as well as Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean regions. Advisory and guideline publications deal with both administration of the sector, such as technical assistance, economic development, planning, engineering, and marketing, and in technology.

<title>A Review of Measures Taken by Regional Marine Fishery Bodies to Address </title>
<section>1</section>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since the early 1990s, the international community has adopted a number of instruments to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries management as laid down in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 Convention). Such instruments include the 1992 Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development; the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement), the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries;^ the 1995 Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security (Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action); and the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provision of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management
of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stock (UN Fish Stocks Agreement).^.
Contemporary fishery issues referred to in these instruments include, in particular, excess fleet capacity; by-catch and discards; monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing vessels; measures to enhance data collection; and application of the precautionary approach.
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the extent to which the above mentioned instruments have, or have not, generally been implemented by, or incorporated in the activities of six FAO and twenty-two non-FAO regional fishery bodies (RFBs) or arrangements. The information, for this specific aspect of the review is based on replies received from the Secretariats of regional fishery bodies, the Annual Reports of the bodies and FAO publications, as appropriate.
The 1982 Convention provides only a few references to the subject of "regional cooperation" in the context of fisheries management. In comparison, the later instruments listed above, provide an increasing number of references to, and a progressively important role for, RFBs, in the conservation and management of fish stocks. In fact, RFBs should now be viewed as critical to the realization of sustainable utilization of world marine capture fisheries.
From the terminology used in the post 1982 Convention instruments, it is important to distinguish between an onus for conservation and management being placed upon the States which comprise RFBs, and the RFBs themselves. It must be recalled that RFBs are not supra-national. They are only as strong and effective as their Members make them. In spite of this fact, many Governments have proven slow to tackle the issue of fisheries reform. There are two main reasons for this:
* benefits are slow to appear and do so only after considerable costs have been incurred for some time; and
* individuals who incur the costs are seldom convinced that they will reap the benefits, and so they resist what they perceive to be a re-distribution of their income.
At present, there are three critical issues facing those responsible for the conservation and management of world marine capture fisheries. These are:
* the problem of over fishing - including the use of insufficiently selective gear which leads to waste in the form of by-catch and discard;
* poor monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of vessels in both zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas - including the problem of reflagging to avoid compliance with international conservation and management measures, and the need for better flag and port State controls; and
* environmental degradation of fish habitats.
To the extent that the law, as opposed to education, science, economics or politics, can provide solutions to these problems, significant progress has been made by the 1982 Convention, and the subsequent international fishery instruments.
The instruments impose specific duties or responsibilities upon both RFBs and their respective members. With regards to unregulated fishing; over capitalization of fleets; excessive fleet size; insufficiently selective fishing gear; by-catch and discards; unreliable data and statistics. Other issues addressed include the use of the precautionary approach; conservation and management of high seas fish stocks; MCS and enforcement by flag and port States; marine pollution; ecosystem protection; data gathering and subsequent management advice; and assistance to developing States.
RFBs should view these post-1982 Convention instruments as providing a checklist that would enable them to effectively fulfil a management role by addressing the critical issues enumerated above and discussed in the body of this document.
The review indicates that very few bodies have started to implement the conservation and management measures provided for in the post-1982 fishery instruments. This conclusion is perhaps not surprising. The instruments present complex scientific, managerial and political considerations that cannot be resolved quickly. Furthermore, the implementation of many of these requirements for RFBs may require amendment of the RFB's constituting agreement. In many cases, the original terms of reference or mandates were constructed in an era pre-dating the post-1982 instruments. From information made available to FAO, only two RFBs are acting to amend their mandates in order to allow them to implement the above mentioned requirements. However, most RFBs are examining the post-1982 instruments, and considering, through appropriately constituted working groups, the consequences of, and steps necessary for, implementation of the instruments.
The result of this state of affairs is that despite international expectations for RFBs to take effective measures to conserve and manage marine capture fisheries, there is little facility for this to occur unless their roles and functions are strengthened as presented in these fishery instruments. In other words, the strenghtening of regional fisheries management must be addressed in a more comprehensive and rational manner if sustainable resource utilization is to be achieved. This is important because under existing international law, and within the current paradigm for the management of straddling, highly migratory and high seas fish stocks, RFBs provide the only realistic mechanism for the enhanced international cooperation in their conservation and management.

I. INTRODUCTION
Background
Over the past 2000 years the international community has lived by a customary law of sea fisheries. Some custom has favoured a freedom of fishing approach, while other custom has attempted a theoretical and/or practical control of the industry. Only in the twentieth century has there been concern with attempting to reach a universally accepted code of regulation for fisheries. This has been part of a broader movement towards codifying the whole law of the sea. The 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (hereafter referred to as the 1982 Convention) represents the attainment of that goal.
The 1982 Convention came into effect on the 16th November 1994. It deals with a comprehensive range of subjects contained in 320 articles, plus nine annexes. The Convention deals with subjects that have not been comprehensively raised before in international law. Such subjects include, inter alia, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State, conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas, maximum sustainable yield (hereafter referred to as MSY) and optimum utilisation, and the establishment of regional fishery bodies (hereinafter referred to as RFBs) for the conservation and management of transboundary and highly migratory stocks.
Despite its magnanimous principles of conservation and environmental protection, the negotiation of the 1982 Convention could not change the fact that by the time it came into force in 1994, some 70 percent of the world's marine capture fisheries were fully exploited, over-exploited or in a state of recovery. In the interests of food security and the contribution made to feeding an increasing global population by the fishery sector, better management of marine capture fisheries had to be addressed.
Throughout the 1990s the international community made several attempts to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries management described in the 1982 Convention. Such negotiations have included the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (Rio Declaration) and Agenda 21: The United Nations Programme of Action (Agenda 21), adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED), the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Measurement Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement), the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, and the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement), and the 1995
Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security.
Purpose
The purpose of this report is to examine the extent to which the 1982 Convention, and the above mentioned 1990s agreements for fisheries, have or have not, been implemented by RFBs. The report is a review and analysis of recent steps taken, and measures implemented, by RFBs to comply with the current international legal regime for fisheries.
Coverage
The 28 RFBs discussed in the Report represent both FAO and non-FAO bodies, from a wide geographic base. The FAO bodies are:
* Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF) (Article VI)
* Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC) (Article VI)
* Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC) (Article VI)
* Asia-Pacific Fisheries Commission (APFIC) (Article XIV)
* General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) (Article XIV)
* Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) (Article XIV)
The non-FAO bodies are:
* Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
* Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT)

* International Whaling Commission (IWC).
Structure of the Report
The report is divided into five chapters.
The introductory first chapter provides an outline for, and the significance of, the report.
Chapter II examines the evolution of the contemporary legal regime relating to international fisheries. This requires an analysis of the fishery related provisions within the 1982 Convention, plus a description of those subsequent international conventions and instruments which have developed the fisheries provisions of the 1982 Convention. Specific reference is given to: Agenda 21, the Compliance Agreement, the Code of Conduct, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, and the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security.
Of particular relevance to this report, Chapter II notes the provisions within the international conventions and instruments that describe an obligation and/or a role for RFBs in the conservation and management of marine capture fisheries.
Chapter III considers the modern evolution, philosophy and purpose of RFBs from the 1902 establishment of ICES. With regard to RFBs discussed in this report, this chapter describes the following information for each body:
* Area of Competence;
* Terms of Reference;
* Current Membership, including (where the information has been made available) financial contributions and degree of membership participation;
* Current Considerations;
* Data Supply and Disclosure;
* Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms; and
* Future Role.
The information for this chapter has been based partly on correspondence received directly from the RFBs, plus RFB Annual Reports and FAO publications, where appropriate.
Chapter IV combines the legal framework data of Chapter II and the RFB descriptions of Chapter III in an evaluation of the contemporary fishery management practices of RFBs. Specifically, those subjects which have been addressed by the 1990s fisheries instruments, and described in Chapter II, including fleet capacity, fishing gear, use of vessel monitoring systems (VMS), application of the precautionary approach, and improved data collection and dissemination, are used as the means for evaluating the extent to which RFBs have taken steps, or not taken steps, to enhance fisheries management. This evaluation is again based on information provided by RFBs and information from other published sources.
Chapter V concludes and summarises the report.

II. THE 1982 UNITED NATIONS LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES LAW
THE FISHERIES REGIME WITHIN THE 1982 CONVENTION
The core provisions of the fisheries regime in the 1982 Convention are contained in the Part V provisions dealing with the Exclusive Economic Zone (i.e. Articles 55-75). The Grotian concept of freedom of fishing on the high seas is maintained by Article 87, Paragraph 1(e). This is so despite the fact that frequent suggestions were made during the course of the Conference to delete freedom of fishing from the list of high seas freedoms. Eventually it was included, but made subject to conditions concerning conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas. There are a further five articles (Article 116-120) which describe the status of high seas fisheries. Of particular importance to this Report, Articles 61 and 119 of the Convention provide for cooperation in fisheries conservation and management through competent sub-regional, regional or global organizations. Finally, it should be noted that in Article 73, the Convention makes provision for the
enforcement of these fishing laws by prosecution and imposition of penalties. This Report proposes to discuss some of the more controversial fishery provisions within the 1982 Convention.
Article 61
Article 61 of the 1982 Convention is titled "Conservation of the Living Resources". The effect of its five sub-paragraphs is to give responsibility to the coastal State for determining "the allowable catch of the living resources in its exclusive economic zone". This is to be done by "proper conservation and management measures" determined by cooperating with competent subregional, regional or global international organizations. The irony of this provision is that despite the clear importance of conservation and management in the new legal regime for fisheries, the 1982 Convention makes no attempt to define what the term means.
The lack of definition given to both "conservation" and "management" is a significant omission when it is remembered that some developed States initially opposed the concept of a two hundred mile exclusive economic zone and were eventually persuaded to support the concept if, inter alia, the conservation and management of fishery resources were made an essential ingredient of the 1982 Convention.
Article 62
Article 62 of the 1982 Convention deals with utilization of living resources based on capacity to harvest and allocation of the surplus of the allowable catch. Like MSY, the term "optimum utilization" used in paragraph (1) was already viewed as an anachronism by many environmentalists in 1982. The preferred expression, later given international recognition in the forthcoming Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future (the Brundtland Report) was for "sustainable development".
Article 63
Article 63 (2) deals with stocks or stocks of associated species which occur both within the EEZ and in area beyond and adjacent to the zone. In respect of such stocks, the coastal State and States fishing for such stocks in the adjacent area are required to seek, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional organizations, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent area. It should be noted that the objective here is merely to cooperate in the "conservation"of these stocks, whereas in the case of stocks that occur within the EEZ's of two or more coastal States, the obligation under Art 63 (1) is to agree on measures necessary for the "conservation and development" of these stocks.
Article 64
Article 64 of the 1982 Convention deals with Highly Migratory Species which are defined as those species listed in Annex I of the Convention. Again, the political sensitivities of drafting the Convention prohibited elaboration on an ambiguous issue that was to remain controversial for many years. This was the question of the extent to which the coastal State had sovereign rights over these species within the EEZ, and the extent to which the obligation to cooperate with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of such species throughout the region, both within and beyond the EEZ, limited the sovereign rights of the coasatal State.
Other legal and management issues left unresolved by Article 64 where it set out a duty to cooperate concerned the lack of regulatory bodies with a capacity to make binding decisions, and what to do about non-complying States, whether members or otherwise, of any such bodies.
Articles 116-120
Articles 116-120 of the 1982 Convention deal with the conservation and management of living resources of the high seas. Many of the legal ambiguity criticisms which have been made against other provisions of the Convention can also be extended to the high seas fishery regime. Thus, what is meant by "cooperation of States" in Article 118; how is "conservation and management of living resources" (also in Article 118) to be achieved; the incompleteness of Article 119(1) provisions on determination of the allowable catch; what is meant by procedures that "do not discriminate" against fishers of a State in Article 119(3).
The provisions are a qualification to the freedom of high seas fishing provided for in Article 87(1)(e) of the 1982 Convention. Their effect is that they impose a dual duty on States engaged in distant water fishing. That is, they must conserve stocks, and cooperate with adjacent coastal States in the harvest of such stocks. However, both the 1982 Convention, and the earlier 1958 High Seas Fishery Convention fail to address the subject of how best to allocate the living resources amongst the potential and actual competing users. Further, the problem of how best to monitor and survey the high seas catches of distant water fishing nations is similarly unaddressed.
SUMMARY EVALUATION OF THE 1982 CONVENTION
The 1982 Convention dealt with subjects that had not been comprehensively raised before in international law. Such subjects include, inter alia, the EEZ, the rights and jurisdiction of coastal States, conservation and management of living resources, and harvesting by maximum sustainable yield and optimum utilization. As these concepts were new, there was ambiguity and uncertainty over both their literal and legal definitions.
Despite the 1982 Convention's central principle of conservation, it could not succeed in addressing the fact that by 1994, when the Convention came into effect, some seventy per cent of the world's marine capture fisheries were fully exploited, over-exploited or in a State of recovery. The problem of overfishing was particularly problematic with regard to high seas fish stocks, straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, where the 1982 Convention provided an inadequate legal and management regime.
The basic problem which confronted the international community at the completion of the 1982 Convention, and today, is the same problem that confronts all aspects of environmental development (such as mining and forestry). That is, how, after centuries of freely exploiting the environment, are we to equitably balance competing demands for access to resources with an appropriate level of environmental protection?
This is a difficult problem to overcome, and possible solutions are beyond the realm of mere fisheries law. In the aftermath of the 1982 Convention, it was necessary for the international community of States to address the following issues:
* provision of legal definitions for certain unclear or outdated words and terms;
* offer a structure and process for the management of Article 63 Straddling Stocks and Article 64 Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in accordance with the 1982 Convention;
* obtain compliance with the law on the part of domestic and foreign fishers. It is apparent that many fishers view the law as an obstacle to be overridden (illegally if necessary), rather than as an effective management policy of which they are both the guardians and the beneficiaries. Specific problems include fleet capacity, by-catch and discard fishing practices, and reflagging of fishing vessels; and
* enforcement of the legal regime. This includes monitoring, control and surveillance of vessels, and data collection regarding catch and effort.
The subsequent international instruments which aimed to address these issues are the subject of the remainder of this chapter.
AGENDA 21 - UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
In 1989 the United Nations General Assembly called for a global meeting to devise integrated strategies that would halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment, and promote environmentally long-term sustainable economic development in all countries. Ultimately, the 1992 Earth Summit produced the Rio Declaration, a Statement of principles on forests, two international conventions: one on Biodiversity and one on Climate Change, and a blueprint for action to be taken globally from the early 1990s into the 21st Century, known as Agenda 21. Both the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 were negotiated by a preparatory commission which met on four occasions between 1990 and 1992. Neither the Rio Declaration, nor Agenda 21 is legally binding, but as the UNCED was attended by more than 178 heads of government, deputy heads of government, or ranking government ministers, the Agreements carry a strong moral obligation that States will comply with the
principles and implement the provisions.
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 specifically deals with protection of the oceans, the seas, coastal areas, and the rational use and development of marine living resources. Paragraph 17.1 describes the 1982 Convention as law which provides the international basis upon which to pursue the protection and sustainable development of marine resources. The paragraph goes on to note that this requires new approaches to marine and coastal area management and development at national, subregional, regional and global levels. Further, such "new approaches" should be integrated, precautionary and anticipatory.
In Program Area C of Chapter 17, recognition is given to the contemporary problems of high seas fishing. The provisions note that the 1982 Convention's management of high seas fisheries, including the adoption, monitoring, and enforcement of effective conservation measures is inadequate. Thus, there are problems of unregulated fishing, overcapitalization, excessive fleet size, vessels reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable data bases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States.
As part of the Agenda 21 blueprint for change, each subject heading provides a proposed framework on how to effect improvement. Thus, the Agreement provides Objectives, suggested Activities, and a program for Means of Implementation. Of particular relevance to regional fishery bodies, Program Area C makes numerous references to subjects requiring cooperation at subregional, regional and global levels. These subjects include, inter alia, the convening of an intergovernmental conference under United Nations auspices on straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks; promoting enhanced data-collection and exchange of data; assessing high seas resource potentials and developing profiles of all target and non-target stocks; encouraging cooperation with other subregional, regional or global fishery bodies, and where none exist, States should cooperate to establish one; enhance human resource development training in high seas fishing techniques, resource assessment, and as observers
and inspectors on fishing vessels; and upgrade systems for monitoring, control and surveillance of marine resources.
In 1994, an Administrative Committee on Coordination/Sub-Committee on Oceans and Coastal Areas (ACC/SC) was established to monitor and review the implementation of Chapter 17. With regard to fisheries, FAO and the United Nations were assigned joint responsibility for overseeing the implementation of Program Area C (marine living resources of the high seas), while only FAO is responsible for the implementation of Program Area D (marine living resources in national jurisdictions).
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES
The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was principally the outcome of the International Conference on Responsible Fishing held in Cancun, Mexico, from 6 to 8 May, 1992.
The primary aim of the Conference was to attain consensus on the need for an International Code on Responsible Fishing. The consensus was reached and formalized in the Declaration of Cancun which sets out a list of subjects requiring attention to preserve the marine environment. Thus, Paragraph 10 of the Declaration of Cancún provides for responsible fishing within zones of national jurisdiction, and paragraph 11 provides that:
"States should cooperate on bilateral, regional and multilateral levels to establish, reinforce and implement effective means and mechanisms to ensure responsible fishing on the high seas, in accordance with relevant provisions of UNCLOS ..."
To address the matters raised in the Declaration of Cancún, it was intended that the Code would cover fishing activity both within and beyond zones of national jurisdiction, and embrace a wide range of subjects leading to better conservation and management of fisheries including, inter alia, the gross overcapacity of the global fishing fleet, the inadequate control of vessels by flag States, the inadequate provision of fishery data to both flag States and coastal States, and trade restrictions intended to achieve environmental protection,
In content, the Code is comprised of twelve articles and two annexes. Articles 1 - 5 cover the nature and scope of the Code; its objectives; its relationship with other international instruments; implementation, monitoring and updating procedures; and the special requirements of Developing Countries. The substantive provisions are in Articles 6 - 12. Article 6 describes the general principles of the Code, making reference to the subsequent more detailed Code provisions. Article 7 deals with Fisheries Management, Article 8 with Fishing Operations, Article 9 with Aquaculture Development, Article 10 with Integration of Fisheries Into Coastal Area Management, Article 11 with Post-Harvest Practices and Trade, and Article 12 with Fisheries Research.
These subjects allow the Code to cover a considerable number of controversial and problematic issues in contemporary fisheries conservation and management. For example, the Precautionary approach is adopted and specifically related to those fishing practices which are particularly damaging to the environment such as uncertainty relating to the size and productivity of stocks, and the impact of fishing activities (including discards) on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as environmental and socio-economic conditions. On the issue of insufficiently selective fishing gear, and environmentally damaging fish practices, the Code provides management objectives which include measures providing that:
"pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, and impacts on associated or dependent species are minimized, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques."
Of particular relevance to this report, the Code makes numerous references to the role of RFBs in establishing a responsible international fisheries regime. Article 1.2 notes that the Code is global in scope, and directed towards fishing entities that include RFBs. From Article 4.1, such entities are charged with collaborating in the fulfilment and implementation of the Code. In Article 6.5 RFBs should apply a precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources. The Article 7 provisions on Fisheries Management make numerous references to the role of RFBs in attaining Management objectives; providing a Management framework and procedures; data gathering and management advice; application of the Precautionary approach; describing management measures; and implementation of the Code.
Article 1.1 of the Code states that it is a voluntary instrument. Thus, it does not have to be formally accepted by Governments in the manner of the below mentioned UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Compliance Agreement.
AGREEMENT TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES BY FISHING VESSELS ON THE HIGH SEAS
A parallel legal initiative that took place at the same time as the Code of Conduct were the negotiations to construct an international agreement that would deal with the problem of reflagged fishing vessels on the high seas. Thus, the Declaration of Cancún specifically provides in paragraph 13 that States should take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter the practice of reflagging of vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas.
The matter of reflagging of fishing vessels was further addressed by Agenda 21 of UNCED where paragraphs 17.51 - 17.53 deal with duties of a flag State, and 17.53 specifically provides that:
"States should take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas."
In September, 1992 the issue of reflagged fishing vessels was taken up by the FAO Technical Consultation on High Seas Fishing, and at the one hundred and second session of the FAO Council, the Council agreed:
"that the issue of reflagging of fishing vessels into flags of convenience to avoid compliance with agreed conservation and management measures, ...should be addressed immediately by FAO, with a view to finding a solution which could be implemented in the near future."
The Compliance Agreement was negotiated under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution, and adopted by the FAO Conference on 24 November 1993.
The Compliance Agreement requires that each State party shall take measures to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity which undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. Further, no party should allow any of its vessels to be used for high seas fishing unless the vessel has been authorized to do so by an appropriate authority of the party. Authorization will not be granted unless the said party is able to exercise effectively its responsibilities with respect to that fishing vessel. Paragraph (5) of Article III seeks to limit the freedom of vessels with a bad compliance record in high seas fisheries from "shopping around" for a new flag.
With respect to the role of RFBs, the Preamble to the Compliance Agreement calls upon States which do not participate in global, regional or subregional fishery organizations or arrangements to do so, with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures. Article V(3) further provides that the parties shall, when and as appropriate, enter into cooperative agreements or arrangements of mutual assistance, on a global, regional, subregional or bilateral basis, in order to promote the objectives of the Agreement. Article VI provides for exchange of information to RFBs in paragraphs (4), (10) and (11). Finally, Article VII requires the parties to cooperate on a global, regional, subregional or bilateral level, to provide assistance to developing country parties, in order to assist them to fulfil obligations under the Agreement.
In accordance with Article XI, the Compliance Agreement will enter into force when 25 instruments of acceptance have been deposited with FAO. At the time of writing this report there were 12 instruments of acceptance: Canada, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Georgia, Myanmar, Sweden, Madagascar, Norway, United States of America, Argentina, the European Community, Namibia and Benin.
UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS
Acting in response to UNCED calls for a UN sponsored intergovernmental conference on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, on 17 December, 1992 the Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution A/C.2/47/L.62 convening such a conference for 1993. This resolution was endorsed by the plenary the week of 21 December 1992.
The convening resolution also provided the terms of reference for the intergovernmental conference. Thus, the primary tasks of the Conference were to:
* identify and assess existing problems related to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;
* consider means of improving fisheries cooperation among States, and
* formulate appropriate recommendations.
AGREEMENT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA OF 10 DECEMBER 1982 RELATING TO THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS
The completed agreement (hereinafter referred to as the UN Fish Stocks Agreement) fulfilled its terms of reference by providing guidance on how best to implement the 1982 Convention provisions on straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks. Thus, many ambiguities and omissions in the 1982 Convention have been addressed, with varying degrees of effectiveness.
First, despite prioritizing conservation and management of highly migratory and straddling fish stocks, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement provides no comprehensive definition of the term. Article 1(b) defines "conservation and management measures" as meaning:
"measures to conserve and manage one or more species of living marine resources that are adopted and applied consistent with the relevant rules of international law as reflected in the Convention and this Agreement."
As the words "conservation and management" may be interpreted as conflicting, should one ever be given priority over the other? In Article 7 there is an attempt to address the ambiguity by the mandate for coastal states and DWFNs to cooperate to achieve compatibility of conservation and management, which includes a framework as to how this can best be achieved.
Other UN Fish Stock Agreement provisions attempt to facilitate and/or strengthen the legal framework of the 1982 Convention. Thus, Article 117 of the 1982 Convention refers to a "duty to cooperate" with respect to national measures for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas. However, the provision does not provide advice on how this is best to be achieved. Article 5 of the Agreement describes a number of specific ways that the duty can be effectuated. Article 6 endorses the precautionary approach and again provides examples on how it can be applied. Of particular relevance to this report Article 8 of the Agreement notes measures to be taken by coastal States and States which fish the high seas to facilitate cooperation including establishing and entering into regional fishery bodies or arrangements. Article 14 strengthens the Convention provisions relating to the sharing of information and cooperation in scientific research. Thus, whereas the Convention
articulates the principle, the Agreement constructs a scheme as to how such cooperation is to be done. Finally, Part VIII of the Agreement incorporates the Part XV Convention provisions relating to the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes but makes them apply mutatis mutandis with respect to any dispute between States Parties to the Agreement, whether they are parties to the Convention or not.
Undoubtedly, the Agreement's most significant contribution concerns those subject areas where new rules and principles are described.
Principle 15 of the 1982 UNCED Rio Declaration articulates the Precautionary approach. It provides:
"In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."
Bearing this provision in mind, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement has adopted the precautionary approach and requires States to apply it both within areas of national jurisdiction and on the high seas. Article 6 of the Agreement provides guidelines for its application.
The inclusion of the precautionary approach within the UN Fish Stocks Agreement is a more appropriate concept for resource management than the principle of maximum sustainable yield described in the 1982 Convention. It is therefore desirable that any practical difficulties of its application be overcome by all State parties.
A second area of significant development in the UN Fish Stocks Agreement concerns the role of regional fishery bodies in the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. The Agreement provides that where a competent RFB exists, States should either become members of the body, or they should agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organizations. This provision is stringently reinforced by Article 8(4) which provides that only those States which are members of such a RFB, or which agree to apply the relevant RFBs conservation and management measures, shall have access to the fishery resources to which these measures apply. For those RFBs, such as the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), which had effectively closed membership to new entrants, there were difficulties with the provisions for new membership. As a result, the final negotiating session of the Agreement chose to include the provision
that membership of relevant RFBs was open to States having a "real interest" in the fisheries concerned. It is a significant oversight that the term "real interest" is nowhere defined, and that presumably the question of whether or not a State has a "real interest" is a matter to be determined by the existing membership of the RFB.
A third area of development in the UN Fish Stocks Agreement concerns increased responsibilities of the flag State. Here, the Agreement provides that States are not permitted to authorize the use of their flag to vessels fishing on the high seas unless they are able to effectively exercise responsibility over such vessels for the purpose of the 1982 Convention and the Agreement. Moreover, in accordance with Article 19(1), the flag State must ensure compliance by its vessels with regional conservation and management measures.
In fact, regional conservation and management measures are further reinforced by the provision which caused great controversy in the conference proceedings, that is, Article 21 of the Agreement. By this provision, a State which is party to the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and a member of the relevant regional fishery body, has the right to board and inspect fishing vessels of another State party in order to ensure compliance with conservation and management measures, even where the flag State is not a member of the regional fishery body. Article 21 describes the framework for enforcement of this principle.
A final significant development of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement over the 1982 Convention is the Article 23 provision on port state jurisdiction. In effect, the Agreement extends the port state enforcement of marine pollution laws described in the 1982 Convention, to now also apply with respect of fishing vessels. Thus, when a fishing vessel is voluntarily in a port, the port state may inspect documents, fishing gear, and any catch on board the vessel in order to ensure compliance with subregional, regional, and global conservation and management measures.
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement was opened for signature in New York on 4 December 1995. Article 40 provides that the Agreement will enter into force 30 days after the date of deposit of the thirtieth instrument of ratification or accession. At the time of writing this report, (7 July 1998) there are 59 signatures and 18 ratifications.
THE ROME CONSENSUS ON WORLD FISHERIES
On 14 and 15 March 1995, a Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries was held in Rome by the invitation of the Director-General of FAO for the purpose of reviewing the state of world fisheries. The ensuing discussion noted that the problems of overfishing in general, and the overcapacity of industrial fishing fleets in particular, were a continuing intergenerational threat to the sustainability of the world's fisheries resources. To the extent that such problems could be remedied by continuing international cooperation, the meeting adopted the Rome Consensus on World Fisheries. This document urges governments and international organizations to take prompt action to:
* reduce fishing to sustainable levels in areas and on stocks heavily exploited or overfished;
* adopt policies, apply measures, and develop techniques to reduce by-catches, fish discards and post-harvest losses;
* review the capacity of fishing fleets in relation to sustainable yields of fishery resources and where necessary reduce these fleets;
* strengthen and support regional, sub-regional, and national fisheries organizations and arrangements for implementing conservation and management measures;
* keep under review the effectiveness of conservation and management measures for ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries and aquatic ecosystems;
* continue and, when possible, increase technical, financial, and other assistance to developing countries, in particular to least developed countries, to support their efforts in fisheries conservation and management, and in aquaculture development;
* encourage States to further develop ecologically sound aquaculture as an important contributor to overall food security;
* strengthen fisheries research and increase cooperation among research institutions;
* increase consultation on fisheries with the private sector and non-government organizations;
* effectively implement the relevant rules of international law on fisheries and related matters which are reflected in the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea;
* bring to a successful conclusion the UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks;
* complete the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries with a view to submitting the final text to the October 1995 FAO Conference; and
* consider ratifying the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas.
These points of action can be said to be of significant persuasive value due to the ministerial level at which the recommendations were formulated.
KYOTO DECLARATION AND PLAN OF ACTION ON THE SUSTAINABLE CONTRIBUTION OF FISHERIES TO FOOD SECURITY
The International Conference on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security was held in Kyoto, Japan from 4 to 9 December 1995. It was attended by 522 participants from 95 States, 11 inter-governmental and nine non-governmental organizations. The Conference was organized by the Government of Japan, in collaboration with the FAO in order to address the increasing demand for, and stagnating supply of, fishery products. State representatives agreed on a set of immediate actions to be taken by States, either directly or in cooperation with other States, or through FAO in cooperation with other appropriate intergovernmental organization and/or regional fishery management organizations or arrangements. Those actions of particular relevance to RFBs include, inter alia:
* To assess and monitor the present and future levels of global, regional and national production, supply and demand of fish and fishery products and their effects on food security, employment, consumption, income, trade and sustainability of production;
* To enhance subregional and regional cooperation and establish, where it is considered appropriate, subregional and regional fishery conservation and management organizations or arrangements for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks; and cooperate to strengthen, where necessary, existing subregional and regional fishery conservation and management organizations and arrangements in order to carry out their assigned tasks;
* To conduct, within their competences and, where appropriate, in cooperation with regional and other intergovernmental organizations, integrated assessments of fisheries in order to evaluate opportunities and strengthen the scientific basis for multispecies and ecosystem management; and
* To provide and coordinate technical and financial assistance programs for developing countries, in particular low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs) and small island developing States, and encourage cooperation between these countries, in order to achieve the contribution of fisheries to food security through, inter alia, (i) a rapid transfer of technology and know-how in enhancement in inland and marine waters; (ii) an upgrade and increase of the capabilities needed to minimize post-harvest losses; and (iii) ensuring improved control of fishing activities within areas under national jurisdiction.
CONCLUSION
The 1982 Convention marked the emergence of a new era in international fisheries law. Thereafter, throughout the 1990s the international community of states has made several attempts to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries conservation and management. Such negotiations have included the 1992 Agenda 21 adopted by the UNCED; the 1993 Compliance Agreement; the 1995 Code of Conduct; the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries; the 1995 Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security; and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.
Clearly each of these negotiations, and resulting instruments, have recognized the central problems in contemporary marine fishery practice. Such problems include:
* product utilization and the contribution of fish to world food security;
* poor flag state control of fleets;
* continuing government subsidies to the fishing industry;
* limited mandates for some RFBs;
* excess fleet capacity leading to overfishing;
* fishing practice that allows for by-catch and discards; and
* monitoring, control and surveillance.
They have accordingly attempted to deal with the shortcomings of the 1982 Convention by various means, which include, inter alia a pivotal role for RFBs. The ability of RFBs to fulfil these expectations and requirements, is the subject of the remaining discussion in this report.

III. THE NATURE AND ROLE OF REGIONAL FISHERY BODIES
ORIGINS AND PURPOSE OF REGIONAL FISHERY BODIES
Article 1, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is:
"To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character ..."
As contemporary international relations are marked by a division between wealthy, developed States and a majority of weak, developing States, cooperation is needed to address inequities and fulfil the provisions of the world order envisaged by international agreements such as the United Nations Charter. Kwiatkowska describes such references as providing a "general duty of states to cooperate with one another."^
Cooperation is also a prominent theme in the 1982 Convention. Here, provisions articulate specific obligations to cooperate on a variety of subjects, including, inter alia, the conservation and management EEZ and high seas fisheries. Further, Articles 61 and 119 of the 1982 Convention elaborate on the duty to cooperate by specifically providing for cooperation through competent sub-regional, regional or global organizations. In fact, this notion of international cooperation is the fundamental philosophy underpinning the existence of RFBs. That is, States will cooperate in order to address regional fishery issues at the scientific, administrative, advisory and/or managerial level (depending on the mandate).
Since the 1970s, and probably as a result of negotiations within the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, there has been a recognizable trend towards institutional cooperation at the regional level. Writing in 1978, Alexander observed that:
"Marine regionalism is more than a "second best" alternative when unilateral or global measures are inappropriate. Increasingly it is developing a rationale and methodology of its own, ...This is particularly true with respect to fisheries conservation and management, and to environmental protection, but the trend is toward regional approaches to other activities, such as marine scientific research, shipping, and education and training...With the increase in regional action by countries with respect to economic and cultural action, including resource development, new forces are emerging to reinforce the regional consciousness of countries."
Within a RFB, States may cooperate to achieve a variety of objectives. These include, inter alia:
* conservation, management, and/or development of living marine resources;
* to protect the special interests of States (within or outside the region);
* to provide a framework for collecting and assessing data;
* to allocate catch quotas;
* to acquire better scientific and/or technical knowledge on stocks and gear; and
* to formalize dispute settlement mechanisms.
It is necessary to note that a technical distinction exists between RFBs and regional fishery arrangements. However, for the purposes of this report, the broad definition offered by FAO in the 1998 Text of Documents Placed Before the High Level Panel of External Experts in Fisheries, will be adopted. This is that the term RFB refers to:
"a mechanism through which three or more States or international organizations that are parties to any international fishery agreement or arrangement collaboratively engage each other in multilateral management of fisheries affairs related to transboundary, straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, through the collection and provision of scientific information and data, serving as a technical and policy forum, or taking decisions pertaining to the development and conservation, management and responsible utilization of the resources. It also refers to fisheries organizations that are charged with the production of scientific information to other bodies responsible for management. A RFB in other words is the instrument for fishery governance at the regional level. Such a body may be concerned with a single species or a group of closely related species or a whole range of species as well as the affiliated aspects of fisheries in a defined region or sub-region." In this
paper, a few bilateral arrangements have been included in the review.
By this definition the first recorded RFB, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) dates from 1902. This was followed by the establishment of the International Whaling Commission in 1949, the General Fishery Council (Commission) for the Mediterranean in 1949, the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission in 1979. The nineteenth century had brought enormous changes to the European fishing industry including the advent of trawler fishing, the substitution of steam vessels for sailing ones, the use of ice for preserving fish on board vessels, and as a result of these technological changes, the period also saw the first evidence of depletion of fishery stocks. The North Sea was the first region to experience intensive exploitation of fishery resources and ICES was created as an intergovernmental marine organization for scientific study of the sea and its resources. Article 1 of the 1964 ICES Convention formally identifies the Council's principal
functions as:
* to promote and encourage research and investigations for the study of the sea particularly related to the living resources thereof;
* to draw up programmes required for this purpose and to organise, in agreement with the Contracting Parties, such research and investigations as may appear necessary;
* to publish and otherwise disseminate the results of research and investigations carried out under its auspices or to encourage the publication thereof.
In addition, since the 1970s a major task for ICES has involved the provision of scientific information and advice to intergovernmental regulatory commissions, the European Commission, and the governments of ICES Member Countries, for purposes of fishery conservation and the protection of the marine environment.
Following the establishment of ICES, other RFBs were established, and as with ICES, they concentrated their efforts on conservation of fishery resources by generating scientific information and promoting scientific cooperation. Such bodies included the International Commission for Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea (1919) and the North American Council for Fishery Investigations (1920).
In the post World War II, United Nations era, there has been a significant increase in the number of RFBs, and in general, the new bodies have had mandates which exceed those assigned to the early twentieth century bodies. This development led to FAO classifying RFBs into three phases of the twentieth century: the pre-United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) period 1902-1950, the Law of the Sea negotiating period 1951-1982, and the post-Third UNCLOS period.
FAO REGIONAL FISHERY BODIES
FAO was constituted as a Specialized Agency of the United Nations in October 1945, when its Constitution came into force. Twenty years later, FAO established a Fisheries Department which is oriented toward the living resources of the ocean and fresh water. Within the UN system, FAO has the mandate to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture. This includes fisheries and marine products. The Constitution goes on to provide that the Organization shall promote and, where appropriate, recommend national and international action with respect to, inter alia, conservation of natural resources; and scientific, technological, social and economic research, the improvement of education and administration, and the spread of public knowledge, as these subjects relate to nutrition and food.
Under FAO auspices, there are nine RFBs. The fundamental difference between FAO and non-FAO RFBs is that admission by non-coastal States to several non-FAO bodies is restricted. FAO bodies are open to all Members without exclusion. Most FAO bodies operate in tropical and sub-tropical areas, and, with the exception of the European Inland Fishery Advisory Commission (EIFAC), the majority of members are developing States. The nine FAO RFBs are:
* Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission (APFIC)
* General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)
* European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission (EIFAC)
* Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC)
* Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF)
* Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa (CIFA)
* Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC)
* Commission for Inland Fisheries of Latin America (COPESCAL)
* Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)
The FAO RFBs have been established in accordance with the provisions of either Article VI or Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
Article VI(1) allows the Conference or Council to establish commissions or regional commissions "to advise on the formulation and implementation of policy and to coordinate the implementation of policy". Thus the bodies are advisory, and cannot perform any direct management functions. The Indian Ocean Fishery Commission, the Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission, the Regional Fisheries Advisory Commission for the Southwest Atlantic, the European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commission, and the Commission for Inland Fisheries of Latin America, were all established under this provision. Similarly Article VI(2) provides that the FAO Conference, Council or Director-General may establish committees and working parties to "study and report on matters pertaining to the purpose of the Organization." WECAFC and the Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa, were established by Council Resolutions under this provision. Marashi notes that:
"The FAO regional bodies established under Article VI of the Constitution are all dependent on the organization for financial and secretariat support. None has an autonomous budget and their expenses are met by the Organization's Regular Programme and ad hoc voluntary contributions by member States. The terms of reference and reporting procedures of these bodies are determined by the Conference or Council. Within the specific mandates provided in Article VI of the Constitution, the commissions or committees established under this Article can only perform advisory functions."
In addition to Article VI regional bodies, the FAO Constitution also allows for Article XIV regional bodies. Here, the Conference can, by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, approve and submit to Members conventions and agreements concerning questions relating to food and agriculture. This includes agreements which are of particular interest to Members of geographical areas specified in such agreements and designed to apply only to such areas. Marashi notes:
"Article XIV agreements, though adopted within the framework of the FAO Constitution, have a legal life of their own. They can therefore provide for different and greater contractual obligations among the parties thereto that extend beyond the obligations already assumed under the FAO Constitution."
FAO RFBs established under Article XIV are APFIC, GFCM and IOTC. The Agreements establishing these bodies provide the opportunity for a more interventionist role in fishery conservation and management.
Thus, Article IV of the Agreement establishing APFIC provides a broad mandate for the Commission in respect of the management of fisheries. The body performs its function by formulating and recommending measures, and initiating and carrying out programmes or projects to conserve and manage resources.
Similarly, Article III of GFCM Agreement gives the Commission a mandate to formulate and recommend measures for the conservation and management of living marine resources which could include regulating fishing methods and fishing gear, prescribing minimum sizes for individual species, establishing fishing seasons and areas, and regulating total catch and effort by allocation amongst members.
Finally, the Agreement establishing IOTC gives the Commission the power to adopt by a two thirds majority of the Members present and voting, regulatory measures. As the most recent of FAO RFBs, the IOTC Agreement goes a step further and provides that members must take action, under their national legislation to, inter alia, implement conservation and management measures which have become binding.
Thus, in theory, the difference between Article VI and Article XIV FAO RFBs is that whereas the former are advisory, the latter can move beyond mere advice, and be regulatory in addressing the serious issues of conservation and management of stocks. In fact, the Report of the Twenty-first Session of the Committee on Fisheries, held from 10-13 March 1995 provides:
"The Committee noted that many of the existing FAO RFBs were established under Article VI of the FAO Constitution and had only limited advisory powers. If effective regional fisheries conservation and management bodies, are to be established within the constitutional framework of FAO, then agreements under Article XIV of the Constitution could provide for a more appropriate structure, with the necessary decision-making powers and flexibility."
Having said this, it can be argued that the effectiveness of both Article VI and Article XIV regional bodies, depends more on the political will of Members to act for conservation and management than on the prescribed mandate within the various establishing agreements. For example, CECAF, an Article VI(2) RFB, has a historical tradition of being proactive in the carrying out of stock assessments, and making recommendations with regard to sustainable fishing practices. In contrast, Article XIV RFBs, despite having wider mandates, can be seen as lacking the political will to address serious conservation and management issues. This matter was raised by the Committee on Fisheries at the twenty-second Session held in Rome from 17-20 March 1997 which said of Article XIV RFBs that:
"They have stronger management mandates which have however been exercised infrequently to date and most of their activities have been of an advisory nature, including the elaboration of management advice and recommendations for consideration and implementation by their members (except for GFCM which adopted a common mesh size regulation following objection procedures and has recently adopted other management measures for tuna, based on those adopted by ICCAT under the same procedures). None of the FAO RFBs, whether established under Article VI or Article XIV, has yet exercised the sensitive and essentially practical functions of fisheries management such as limitation of access, allocation of effort or catch quotas, monitoring, control and surveillance, enforcement and dispute settlement."
Apart from Members political will, there is also a notable difference between RFBs with a clearly dynamic secretariat and those without. Particularly in the case of FAO RFBs, Secretariat staffing can present problems where limited personnel are required to undertake a range of activities in addition to their normal roles.
For the purposes of this report, six FAO RFBs (that is, three Article VI bodies, and three Article XIV bodies) have been selected with a view to reviewing their mandate, functions, and degree of implementation of the provisions that comprise the contemporary international law of marine capture fisheries. This excludes the non-operational CARPAS and the various Inland Fisheries Commissions. The six FAO bodies are:
* General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)
* Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission (APFIC)
* Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC)
* Fishery Committee for Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF)
* Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC)
* Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)

Membership of the Commission is open to all Members and Associate Members of FAO. Other States that are Members of the United Nations, any of its specialized Agencies or the International Atomic Energy Agency may be admitted as members by a two-thirds majority of the Commission's members.
Members make no direct financial contribution, but they provide expenses for their delegations to attend Sessions in accordance with Article VIII.1 of the APFIC Agreement. Participation by developing States is encouraged by the conducting of events such as an APFIC Symposium to be held as part of the APFIC Session. Here, States are invited to prepare and present reports on their status and problems relating to specific issues. It is intended that this will lead to the formulation of projects when and where appropriate. The main constraints against wider participation in the work of APFIC are either lack of interest, or change of policy by developed States Members such as France and the United Kingdom (due to the changed status of Indochina and Hong Kong), the United States of America (which is less involved in the Western Pacific), and Australia and New Zealand, (which are giving more emphasis to the South Pacific region).
Current Considerations
The Report of the Sixty-seventh Session of the Executive Committee of the Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission held in Bangkok from 10-12 June 1998 describes current issues which are of concern to the region, its marine fisheries and aquaculture.
Paragraph 8 of the Report notes that while the total fishery production had been increasing during the last decade, marine fishery production showed a slower rate of increase with an average of 2.2 percent per year during the 1990-1995 period. Furthermore, as fisheries in most coastal waters in the region were fully exploited or overexploited, and only a few Asian countries operated in the high seas, the marine fishery production in the region might reach a plateau in the near future.
Paragraph 17 recognizes the lack of timely management measures in most fisheries derived from lack of accurate fishery statistics and resource appraisal to formulate management options. Moreover, management of transboundary and shared fish stocks would require joint effort among countries concerned to develop management actions that are compatible with those of the resources within national jurisdictions. The paragraph also notes that in order to promote responsible fisheries, fishers should be informed and cooperate in implementing the Code of Conduct. These management measures should be enforced through proper legislative and institutional mechanisms to ensure compliance.
Paragraph 18 notes that some Members of the Committee suggested that APFIC should look into fisheries management frameworks in various sub-regions, such as the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Bay of Bengal, in order to assist the countries concerned to formulate appropriate management options in these areas.
Regarding the future directions of APFIC, the Executive Committee expressed grave concerns over the unsustainable use of fishery resources in the region; reduction of support from FAO (Resolution 13/97 adopted by the 29th Session of the FAO Conference in November 1997), lack of commitment on the part of the Members, including lack of active participation in the work of APFIC and reluctance to make financial contributions.
The Committee stressed that when these issues had been discussed in the past, no resolution had been reached due to lack of commitment from the Members. Paragraph 25 states that:
"APFIC is not only paralyzed, but also its existence is under threat."
Data Supply and Disclosure
Attempts are being made to improve data collection and to establish databases on fishery information. Once established, data supply would be required from all Members in order to review the current status of resources and fisheries. The main current constraints to strengthening data supply and disclosure by reporting, disseminating and distributing at both the sub-regional and regional level, are lack of funding, and lack of skilled personnel.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:
Article XIV of the APFIC Agreement provides that any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement, if not settled by the Commission, shall be referred to a Committee comprised of one member appointed by each of the parties to the dispute, plus an independent Chairman chosen by the members of the Committee. The recommendation of this Committee is not binding but it shall become the basis for any renewed consideration by the parties. If, as a result of this process, the dispute is not settled, it may be referred to the International Court of Justice, unless the parties can agree on another method of dispute settlement.
Future Role
The Executive Committee agreed that the vision for APFIC in the next century was clearly to ensure the sustainable contribution of fisheries to food security and the economies of its member countries. To fulfil this vision, the urgent mission of the Commission was to help accelerate self-reliance of its Members in the conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources. This would necessitate the implementation of programmes of action to be undertaken with close regional cooperation. These programmes of action are:
* collection, dissemination and exchange of fishery information and statistics;
* development of national fishery policies towards attaining the sustainability of fisheries and fishery resources;
* marine fisheries management and related research;
* development of responsible aquaculture, with increased emphasis on rural aquaculture development and the development of culture-based fisheries; and
* acceleration of the transfer of appropriate technology and capacity building in the fisheries sector.

Current Considerations
During its last three Sessions (Twenty-first Session, Alicante, Spain, 1995; Twenty-second Session, Rome, 1997; and the Twenty-third Session, Rome, 1998), GFCM has taken steps to strengthen its role in fisheries conservation and management.
At its Twenty-first Session, the Council adopted three recommendations relating to the conservation and management of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the Mediterranean. The first recommendation prohibits fishing using pelagic longline vessels greater than 24 meters in length for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean during the period from 1^st June to 31^st July. The second requested members of GFCM to take the necessary measures to prohibits any taking and landing of bluefin tuna weighing less than 6.4 kg, and that when this constitutes incident catch, it should not exceed 15 percent of the number of fish per landing of the total bluefin catch of sail boats or its equivalent in percentage by weight. The third recommendation requested Contracting Parties fishing bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean sea to take, among other things, the necessary measures to prevent any increase in the fishing mortality rate for the years 1995 and beyond.
At its Twenty-second Session, the Members of GFCM adopted amendments to its Agreement and to its Rules of Procedures. The amendment for the agreement were in two sets, the first dealing mainly with the possibility of regional economic integration organizations to become members of GFCM and the second mainly with the establishment of an autonomous budget. The first set of amendments was approved by the FAO Council at its One hundred and thirteenth Session in November 1997. The name of GFCM was changed by replacing "Council" by "Commission" and the European Community became a member of GFCM in 1998. The second set of amendments which involves new obligations would come into force only on their acceptance by two thirds of the Contracting Parties.
The Council/Commission also adopted three resolutions in management measures:
* Resolution 97/1 concerning the ban on the use of large-scale driftnets in the Mediterranean;
* Resolution 97/2 calling upon members of GFCM to report to the Council on any fishing activities by vessels flying the flag of non-members which do not comply with GFCM recommendations; and
* Resolution 97/3 on the prohibition of the bluefin tuna purse-seine fishery during the period 1 to 31 August and prohibition of airplanes and helicopters in support of such fishing operations in the month of June.
The Twenty-third Session of GFCM was held in Rome from 7-10 July 1998. The Session considered the implementation of the resolutions adopted at the Twenty-second session relating to fisheries management on the extent of aerial spotting and purse seiners to fish for tuna, and the extent of driftnet fishing practice within the area.
The Commission stressed the need to improve the overall quality and reliability of GFCM statistical and information systems in order to base management decisions on the best scientific evidence available.
A FAO/COPEMED project, financed by Spain, became operational in 1996. To this end, the project is conducting a feasibility studies that should permit it to establish a data base on social and economic indicators in the Western Mediterranean. The goal of the five year FAO/COPEMED project is to help the participating countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Malta, Italy, France and Spain) in establishing a coordinated scheme for generating scientific criteria, and recommendations that permit application of the most adequate strategy for the optimum management of the resources. At this stage, COPEMED is dealing with issues of information systems; research and training; and cooperation and coordination. Another similar project financed by Italy is being finalized for the Adriatic Sea.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Member countries provide data of catch and effort directly to FAO. Some specific data materials are supplied to the GFCM Secretariat. There are problems with delay in the provision of data, also some accuracy/ reliability problems where States do not have the expertise or economic ability to provide highly technical materials. Finally, there are problems where States have conflicting interests between their fishery programmes and GFCM policy.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
Article XV of the Agreement of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean provides that any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement, if not settled by the Commission, shall be referred to a committee composed of a member appointed by each of the parties to the dispute, plus an independent chairman chosen by Members of the Committee. The recommendations of such a Committee, while not binding, shall become the basis for renewed consideration by the parties. If the dispute remains unsettled, it shall be referred to the International Court of Justice, or in the case of a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a member of the Commission, it shall be submitted to arbitration, unless the parties to the dispute agree to another method of settlement.
Future Role
The long-term work program of GFCM includes the following goals:
* for demersal resources, fisheries management by means of effort control, in combination with technical measures such as seasonal or permanent fishery closures;
* catch limits on bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean (in conformity with ICCAT regulations), and priority given to assessing swordfish stocks to bring them under management in cooperation with ICCAT;
* management schemes, including the precautionary approach, should be introduced for small pelagic fish stocks;
* a control scheme for fishing vessels using "flags of convenience";
* statistics collection to be standardized, and the Secretariat should maintain relevant data bases of information;
* development of an integrated systems-based approach to fisheries management; and
* development of aquaculture.
INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
Area of Competence
Indian Ocean (defined for this purpose as being FAO statistical areas 51 and 57) and adjacent seas north of the Antarctic Convergence, insofar as it is necessary to cover such areas for the purpose of conserving and managing stocks that migrate into or out of the Indian Ocean.
Terms of Reference
To promote cooperation among members that ensures the appropriate management, conservation and optimum utilization of tuna and tuna like species, as well as to encourage the sustainable development of fisheries based on such stocks. In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission shall have the following (inter alia) functions and responsibilities, in accordance with the principles expressed in the relevant provisions of the 1982 Convention:
* to keep under review the conditions and trends of the stocks and to gather, analyse and disseminate scientific information, catch and effort statistics and other data relevant;
* to encourage, recommend and co-ordinate research and development activities in respect of the stocks and fisheries covered by the Agreement, and such other activities as the Commission may decide appropriate, including activities connected with transfer of technology, training and enhancement, having due regard to the need to ensure the equitable participation of Members of the Commission in the fisheries and the special interests and needs of Members in the region that are developing countries;
* to keep under review the economic and social aspects of the fisheries based on the stocks covered by this Agreement bearing in mind, in particular, the interests of developing coastal States.
The Commission may, by a two-thirds majority of the Members present and voting, adopt conservation and management measures binding on its Members. Such regulatory measures are subject to an objection procedure.
Current Membership

India Pakistan
Ten percent of the total budget of the Commission is divided equally among all the Members. In addition, ten percent of the total budget is divided equally among the Members having fishing operations in the area targeting species covered by the Commission. Forty percent of the total budget is allocated among the Members on the basis of per caput GNP for the calendar year three years before the year to which the contributions relate, weighted according to the economic status of the Members in accordance with World Bank classifications. The final 40 percent of the total budget is allocated among members in proportion to their average catch in the three calendar years beginning with the year five years before the year to which the contributions relate, weighted by a coefficient reflecting their development status.
Four Commission meetings have been held to date, most members and countries entitled to join have been represented. Observer participation is limited to those who attended the first two meetings. Participation in technical activities and Commission bodies is at the cost of members.
Current Considerations
Establishment of scientific working groups to assess stock status and distribution for various tuna groupings (e.g. tropical tunas, temperate tunas, neritic tunas, by-catch) against which the need and type of management measures can be determined. The implications of the precautionary approach will also be determined in relation to objective reference points. Statistical reporting and monitoring need to be improved.
Fleets operating under flags of convenience are a major potential issue as they can undermine management measures in the absence of trade related restrictions.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Requirements are limited at this time to catch, effort and biological data for scientific purposes. There are currently unacceptable delays in the supply of data and this subject will be addressed in the next Commission meeting. The IOTC reports that the main constraint to reporting data is that there are inadequate national data collection systems, plus the fact that some members insist on scientific data being supplied through Government agencies.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
There have been no disputes since the creation of IOTC. Any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement, if not settled by the Commission, shall be referred for settlement to a conciliation procedure to be adopted by the Commission. The results of the conciliation procedure, while not binding, shall become the basis for renewed consideration by the parties concerned of the matter out of which the disagreement arose. If, as a result of this procedure, the dispute is still not settled, it may be referred to the International Court of Justice, unless the parties agree to another method of dispute settlement.
Future Role
To fulfil the objectives described within the IOTC Agreement, specifically to achieve credible results in tuna management. This is difficult, and various problems must be addressed. In particular,
* that tuna stock assessment is problematic. Tagging seems to give the only credible results, and this is expensive;
* tropical tuna stocks are robust because of the distribution of the fish, their high fecundity and fast growth. This is not the case with the temperate bluefin tunas which are long-lived and have well-defined breeding and migration patterns, making them more vulnerable. As Japan was the main market for these temperate fish, it was assumed that a certificate of origin program would aid in enforcing quotas. However the program seems to be unravelling due to leaks in the system, and the development of other markets in other countries;
* the difficulty to negotiate quotas particularly where there are sequential fisheries such as surface fishing for juveniles and longlining for adults; and
* reflagging of vessels.
WESTERN CENTRAL ATLANTIC FISHERY COMMISSION
Area of Competence
: Western Central Atlantic Ocean
Terms of Reference
Noting the need for international cooperation for the conservation, development and utilization of the living resources, especially shrimps of the area, the Commission shallinter alia:
* promote and assist in the collection of national statistics and biological data relating to fisheries in general, and to shrimp fisheries in particular; and to provide for the compilation and dissemination of these data on a regional basis;
* facilitate the coordination of research programmes and promote, where appropriate, the standardisation of research methods;
* promote the interchange of information relating to fisheries of the region;
* promote and coordinate, on a national and regional basis, studies of the effect of the environment and of pollution on fisheries, and studies of appropriate methods of control and improvement;
* promote and assist the development of aquaculture and stock improvement;
* encourage education through the establishment or improvement of national and regional institutions and by the organisation of training courses and seminars;
* assist member governments in establishing rational policies for the development and utilization of the resources consistent with national objectives and the conservation and improvement of the resources; and
* promote and coordinate international aid to further the achievement of the objectives of the Commission.
The Commission is not actively involved in fisheries management in the region. The responsibility for fisheries management is left to the member countries. WECAFC may provide management advice or scientific information upon which management measures should be based.

Membership is open to all Members and Associate Members which notify the Director-General of their desire to be considered as members. FAO provides the Secretariat and technical assistance. Members are required to bear the costs of participation in Commission meetings, but it is rare for them to do so. For the majority of WECAFC meetings held to date, FAO has had to bear the costs through some specific activity, such as workshops or consultations. Further, participation in meetings has been low as most developing States in the region have a lack of funding. If funding is made available, participation in meetings has been good. Incentives to encourage participation in the work of WECAFC include the provision of technical assistance, regional cooperation for the management of shared stocks, and provision of a neutral forum for discussing issues. The main constraint prohibiting wider participation in the work of WECAFC is lack of funding.
Current Considerations
The Twenty-fifth FAO Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean was conducted from 16-18 June 1998, and considered inter alia the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries in the Latin American and Caribbean Region.
Other subjects of note regarding Western and Central Atlantic fisheries are that there have been no reports of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing in the WECAFC Region during the period 1997/1998. There are unverified reports of unauthorized fishing by small-scale vessels fishing in neighboring country zones of national jurisdiction, and unverified reports of unauthorized fishing by industrial vessels (shrimping and longlining for large pelagics) by vessels from outside the WECAFC region.
Regarding fisheries by-catch and discards, countries of the WECAFC Region that have shrimp trawl fisheries (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Mexico, Suriname and Venezuela) are now landing more by-catch for human consumption than in the past. This is partly due to an increasing demand for fish and consequent higher prices being paid for fish. In an attempt to reduce the by-catch from trawl fishers, countries have introduced turtle exclusion devices. Venezuela is also experimenting with the use of fish exclusion devices.
Some States within the WECAFC Region are in the process of revising their fisheries legislation and making other policy changes concerning national authorizations for vessels to fish on the high seas. In this process, some States are attempting to implement elements of the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas as well as the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. To this end, FAO has provided technical assistance to the OECS countries (Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts/Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and Barbados in the preparation of a draft bill. This bill will be sent to the OECS members for formal review by the government and for possible adoption into legislation.
Data Supply and Disclosure:
There are no specific requirements for data supply and disclosure. Members supply the basic data to the Fishery Information, Data and Statistics Unit of the FAO Fisheries Department which is published by FAO. Sharing and Disclosure of data is done on a voluntary basis through workshops dealing with the assessment of fishery resources in the region (e.g. Assessment of spiny lobster resources in the WECAFC region, or assessment of shrimp and ground-fish fishery on the Guiana-Brazil Shelf). The main constraints to reporting data supply and disclosure lie with the inability of the developing States of the region, especially small island developing States, to continuously support a data collection programme.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
There are no formal mechanisms.
Future Role
As a result of the above mentioned unauthorized fishing in WECAFC country zones of national jurisdiction, a number of countries within the WECAFC Region are in the process of improving their monitoring, control and surveillance capacity.
Further, the Seventh Session of the WECAFC Working Party on the Assessment of Marine Fishery Resources, and the Second Session of the Working Party on Fishery Economics and Planning held in Belize in December 1997, considered the future role of the Commission in a changing fisheries world and made a number of concrete suggestions and recommendations for the restructuring of the body. The need for regional approaches to fisheries management was highlighted and WECAFC was considered the most appropriate body to undertake this task. It was recommended that the Commission at its next meeting in 1999 give serious consideration to altering its status from an Article VI to an Article XIV body within the FAO structure to give it more operational flexibility.
A new method of working, using ad hoc working groups (following the pattern of ICCAT and ICES) that are of interest to the members of the Commission and from which they will derive direct benefit, was recommended. Members of these working groups are expected to finance their own participation, while FAO is expected to provide the current level of administrative, technical and financial support. This new process of operation will be approached slowly, extending over a period of years. The preliminary ad hoc working groups were identified, and two are in operation, one for spiny lobster, and the other for ground fish of the Guiana-Brazil shelf.
FISHERY COMMITTEE FOR THE EASTERN CENTRAL ATLANTIC
Area of Competence
: Eastern Central Atlantic between Cape Spartel and the Congo River.
Terms of Reference
To promote the optimum utilization of the living aquatic resources of the area, by the proper management and development of the fisheries and fishing operations, the development of marine brackish water aquaculture and the improvement of related processing and marketing activities in conformity with the objectives of its members. This is to be done by (inter alia):
* reviewing the state of these resources and the industries based on them;
* promoting the collection, interchange, dissemination and analysis or study of statistical socio-economic, biological and environmental data and other marine fishery information;
* establishing the scientific basis for regulatory measures leading to the conservation and management of marine fishery resources, formalising such measures through subsidiary bodies, as required, and making appropriate recommendations for the adoption and implementation of these marine measures;
* encouraging, recommending and coordinating training and extension activities in all aspects of marine fisheries;
* promoting and encouraging the utilization of the most appropriate fishing craft, gear and techniques; and
* promoting and encouraging in cooperation with other regional bodies, as appropriate, activities concerned with the processing, preservation and marketing of fish and fish products.

Membership is open to Members and Associate Members selected by the Director-General from among Members and Associate Members in Africa whose territories border the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Spartel to the mouth of the Congo River, and those Members and Associate Members fishing or conducting research in the sea area concerned or having some other interest in the fisheries thereof, whose contribution to the work of the Committee the Director-General deems to be essential or desirable. Members make no regular financial contribution, however some member countries, such as Spain and Morocco fund technical activities such as workshops and seminars, whilst Cameroon and Nigeria have made some token financial contributions. Lack of wider participation in the activities of CECAF is due to budgetary constraints and lack of sponsorship.
Current Considerations
At its Fourteenth Session held in Mauritania 6-9 September 1998, CECAF opted to maintain its status as an Article VI RFB which will progressively work towards upgrading to an Article XIV body. It abolished its four Subsidiary Bodies and agreed to have a simpler structure consisting of a Committee and a Scientific Sub-Committee (SSC).
Evaluation of the main resources in the region will continue, and to this end, ad hoc Working Groups are to be organized on mackerel and horse mackerel, sardinellas, and shrimp in the Gulf of Guinea, plus further assessments on black hake. Attention will also be given to the subject of discards.
Regarding fisheries statistics, the Committee agreed to promote exchanges between countries and implement improvements to collection of statistics at the level of artisanal fisheries.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Compliance with the international legal regime for fisheries is monitored by Members presenting reports at Sessions. Data supply and disclosure is addressed by Members reporting catch statistics to FAO. Problems exist in that all landing grounds cannot be adequately covered, and data reporting is consequently incomplete.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
There are no formal mechanisms.
Future Role
Regarding the future transition of CECAF to an Article XIV FAO body, FAO has been requested to provide Draft Agreements for a possible Article XIV body and information concerning the functioning of IOTC and GFCM, both Article XIV bodies, regarding financial regulations and the autonomous budget.
INDIAN OCEAN FISHERY COMMISSION
Area of Competence
: Indian Ocean and adjacent seas (excluding the Antarctic Area)
Terms of Reference

Membership of IOFC is open to all Members and Associate Members of FAO.
Current Considerations and Future Role
IOFC was comprised of four subsidiary bodies. These are:
* Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna (Tuna Committee). This has become obsolete since the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.
* Committee for the Development and Management of the Fisheries Resources of the Gulfs;
* Committee for the Development and Management of Fisheries in the Southwest Indian Ocean; and
* Committee for the Development and Management of Fisheries in the Bay of Bengal.
The Eleventh Session of IOFC will be convened on 17February 1999. The Commission is expected to abolish the above four subsidiary bodies, in effect recommending the Council to abolish IOFC itself. As a prelude to this meeting three of IOFC subsidiary bodies have met.
At its Ninth Session (Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, 6-9 April 1997) the Committee for the Development and Management of Fisheries in the Gulfs (Gulfs Committee) suggested that the future of the Committee be reviewed at a high level consultation. The High Level Consultation was held in Cairo, Egypt in December, 1997 and followed by a Technical Meeting in Teheran, Islamic Republic of Iran in May, 1998. The Meeting adopted a Draft Agreement to create a new body under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
At its Seventh Session (Mahe, Seychelles, 29 September - 2 October, 1997) the Committee for the Development and Management of Fisheries in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), noted that, in principle, it did not oppose the establishment of an Article XIV body under the FAO Constitution to deal with non-tuna fisheries of common interest to island and mainland States of the region. Members requested time to consult with their governments on the matter.
At its Tenth Session (New Delhi, India, 24-25 September 1997) the Committee for the Development and Management of Fisheries in the Bay of Bengal agreed by consensus that their Committee should be merged with APFIC. At the Twenty-sixth Session of APFIC, the Commission approved the merger and consequently requested the FAO Council to give its approval.
NON-FAO REGIONAL FISHERY BODIES
In addition to FAO RFBs, there also exists a number of independent organizations which have regional or sub-regional roles in fisheries management. Although these non-FAO bodies share certain objectives in common with the FAO RFBs, they tend to exhibit a different variety of form and function. For example, they may deal with a single species or group of associated species within a region, (e.g. International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), or they may be primarily concerned with collecting scientific data, (e.g. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), or they may be based upon a specific geographic region and cover a whole range of species within their area of competence, (e.g. Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)).
Non-FAO RFBs may undertake a wide variety of tasks ranging from conducting scientific research, compiling and analyzing data, formulating conservation and management measures, determining total allowable catch and allocating quotas. The need for sound scientific advice based on data concerning the state of the resource is common to all RFBs. FAO describes the three most common methods of collecting scientific information as:
* through an independent scientific body such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which undertakes this task for the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC), the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO), and the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC);
* through an internal body, established under the agreement, usually consisting of experts from members of the body, as in the case of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); or
* through ad hoc working groups or technical consultations as with most FAO bodies.
The scientific advice must consider extra-scientific factors including technological, legal, and economic factors and, as a result of the political nature of RFB decisions, the advice is also realistically likely to consider socio-political factors.
Most of the RFBs dealing with conservation and management of living marine resources have regulatory powers relating to the decision-making process and the implementation of decisions.
Management decision-making, when dealing with issues such as the allocation of fishing effort and catches, or the monitoring, control and surveillance of transboundary stocks outside national jurisdictions, inherently involves making political decisions. Perhaps as a result of this fact, there has been a change of emphasis in the parameters to be included in fishery management decision-making with more obvious consideration of socio-economic factors.
Once decisions are made by the RFB, problems can arise with regard to enforcing policy. Regional fishery bodies are not supra-national, and the decisions that they make are not directly binding on individuals unless national legislation is taken by member States to give effect to the decisions. The document notes:
"it is increasingly apparent that passing recommendations is only a partial solution to the problem of effective management of fisheries, unless action is also taken to ensure that these recommendations are followed by individual members."
The high seas present particular difficulties with regard to enforcing RFB decisions. Here, policing is the responsibility of each member with respect to vessels flying its flag. This can be an onerous burden for States that lack the material or financial means of exercising such control, especially with regard to vessels engaged in long-distance fishing. Some RFB agreements provide for officials of any member country to search and (where necessary) seize vessels of other member countries which are on the high seas and acting in violation of either the convention or the regulatory measures adopted under it, but only the authorities of the licensing country may conduct prosecutions and impose penalties. For the purposes of this report, 22 non-FAO RFBs have been selected with a view to reviewing their mandate, functions, and degree of implementation of the provisions that comprise the contemporary international law of marine fisheries. These are:
* Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR);
* Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT);
* Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA);
* Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (I-ATTC);
* International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC);
* International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES);
* International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT);
* Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO);
* Comité régional des pêches du Golfe de Guinée (COREP);
* Commission Sous-régionale des pêches (CSRP);
* Joint Technical Commission for the Argentina/Uruguay Maritime Front (CTMFM);
* North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO);
* North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO);
* North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC);
* International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC);
* North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC);
* North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES);
* Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC);
* South Pacific Permanent Commission (CPPS);
* Pacific Community (SPC);
* Latin American Organization for the Development of Fisheries (OLDEPESCA); and
* International Whaling Commission (IWC).
COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES
Area of Competence
The area South of 60^o South latitude and to the Antarctic marine living resources of the area between that latitude and the Antarctic Convergence which form part of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.
Terms of Reference
Article II notes that the objective of the Convention is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, and for the purposes of the Convention, the term "conservation" is deemed to include "rational use".
Any harvesting and associated activities in the area must be conducted in accordance with the following principles of conservation:
* prevention of decrease in the size of any harvested population to levels below those which ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose its size should not be allowed to fall below a level close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment;
* maintenance of the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent and related populations of Antarctic marine living resources and the restoration of depleted populations to the levels defined above; and
* prevention of changes or minimization of the risk of changes in the marine ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades, taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making possible the sustained conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.

Article VII of the CCAMLR Agreement establishes a Commission for the function of carrying out the objectives and principles. Each State Party and regional economic integration organization which has acceded to the Convention shall be entitled to be a Member of the Commission. A Contracting Party seeking to participate in the work of the Commission shall notify the Depository of the basis upon which it seeks to become a Member of the Commission and of its willingness to accept conservation measures in force. The Depository shall communicate this notification to each Member of the Commission who may request a special meeting of the Commission to consider the matter. If there is no request for a meeting, the Contracting Party submitting the notification shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements for Commission Membership.
Current Considerations
The most important international fishery issue which CCAMLR has recently addressed is the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in the CCAMLR Convention Area. On the 18th December 1997, following the Sixteenth Meeting of the Commission (27 October-7 November 1997) and the Report of the Standing Committee on Observation and Inspection (SCOI) (28 October-31st October 1997), the CCAMLR Executive Secretary wrote to FAO that there was general agreement among CCAMLR members on the following points:
* the evidence of large-scale illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Convention Area during 1996/7 and in the beginning of the 1997/8 season, seriously undermined the work of CCAMLR in achieving the Convention's objective;
* the extent of existing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing posed a serious threat to the conservation of stocks of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) in the immediate future and also to the survival of several species of seabirds in the Southern Ocean taken as incidental by-catch in longline fishing operations;
* all information received points to a blatant disregard by non-Contracting Parties of the CCAMLR conservation regime and of the sovereign rights of Coastal States in the Convention Area;
* not only vessels of non-Contracting Parties to CCAMLR but also vessels of CCAMLR Contracting Parties were reported fishing in the Convention Area in contravention of the CCAMLR conservation measures in force; and
* the situation called for collective efforts within CCAMLR, measures by flag States and Coastal States and steps vis-a-vis non Contracting Parties to enhance enforcement and compliance with conservation measures regarding living resources in the Convention Area.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Article XX of the CCAMLR Agreement provides that Members of the Commission shall provide annual statistical, biological and other data and information to the Commission and to the Scientific Committee (established under Article XIV). In addition, Members shall provide information about their harvesting activities, including fishing areas and vessels, so as to enable reliable catch and effort statistics to be compiled.
Conservation policy is determined by the Commission with the advice of data collected by the Scientific Committee. Historically, this has been a precarious relationship. It has frequently resulted in tensions between the two parties as scientific and technical knowledge is used in a decision-making forum by political representatives voicing the vested interests of their respective States. The tension between the Commission and the Scientific Committee was particularly evident in the 1980s when two powerful distant water fishing nations blocked the required consensus voting on the ground that there was insufficient scientific data to support certain conservation measures. This created a situation where a lack of scientific data, either because it was not made available by certain State parties exercising a political decision to protect their fishing industries, or because it did not exist, was interpreted as evidence to allow current fishing trends to continue.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Article XXV of the CCAMLR Agreement provides for dispute or conflict resolution. Where disputes arise concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention, the Contracting Parties shall consult among themselves with a view to having the dispute resolved by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means of their own choice. If the dispute fails to be resolved by these means, the matter can, with the consent of both the parties be referred to the International Court of Justice, or to arbitration.
Future Role
In response to the problems of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities described above, CCAMLR has begun developing an integrated set of political and legal measures for resolving this complex situation. The set of measures adopted by CCAMLR in 1997 includes new Conservation Measures 118/XVI (Scheme to Promote Compliance by non-Contracting Party Vessels with CCAMLR Conservation Measures) and 119/XVI (Requirement for Contracting Parties to License their Flag Vessels in the Convention Area), Resolution 12/XVI on Vessel Monitoring Systems, amendments to the text of the System of Inspection and mechanisms to address the actions of non-Contracting Parties. Some measures were drawn from the experience of other fisheries organizations, in particular NAFO and ICCAT, whilst other measures took into account recent developments in international law. These measures will be reviewed at the November, 1998 meeting of CCAMLR.
COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA
Area of Competence
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans where Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) are found.
Terms of Reference
To collect, analyze, and interpret scientific and other relevant information on SBT, to adopt conservation and management measures including the total allowable catch and its allocation among the Members.
Current Membership
Australia Japan New Zealand
These three States are the founding members of CCSBT. Over the past three years, membership contributions have been Australia: A$ 221,763; Japan: A$247,314; and New Zealand A$67,023. All members participate in meetings and programmed activities of the Commission where appropriate. Incentives for other States and entities to participate in the work of the Commission include secure access to the SBT resource, participation in determining management measures and quota allocation and access to joint research programmes and results. All eligible States and entities are encouraged to participate, however some potential participants are reluctant to accept and comply with the current management measures. For example, States taking significant quantities of SBT which are not members of the CCSBT are the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Korea. South Africa is a relevant coastal State which is not a Member of the CCSBT, but its nationals do not take SBT.
Current Considerations
The overriding current consideration for CCSBT, and one which threatens its future viability and existence, is the need to reach agreement between Members on the state of the SBT stock, its predictions for recovery, and the setting of annual catch quotas. In particular, fleet capacity has been raised in discussion within CCSBT as there are concerns that the resource may not be able to sustain current levels of fishing effort by Member and non-Member fleets.
Regarding other contemporary problems in marine fisheries conservation and management:
* CCSBT has received no reports of fishing with large scale pelagic driftnets in its area of competence;
* CCSBT is promoting and encouraging the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and is in the process of reviewing the Convention to determine the action necessary to achieve compatibility with the Code.
* The Ecologically Related Species Working Group Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) is also to consider the issue of shark conservation and management in the CCSBT area; and
* CCSBT Members have implemented measures to mitigate seabird by-catch during longline fishing operations (e.g. Tori poles) and continue to examine further by-catch mitigation measures through the CCSBT Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG). Information on by-catch and discards has been collected by observers during the period under review and observer reports and other recent data are to be reviewed at the 1998 meeting of the ERSWG.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Parties report on their performance when both Members and other countries and entities, attending the Commission meetings as observers, report to the Commission on the activities of their fishing fleets. Scientists from Members exchange fisheries data for the purpose of undertaking analysis on the state of the stock. The scientific advice on SBT is provided by a permanent Scientific Committee. The Scientific assessment process was recently subject to external peer review. The main constraint that can affect data supply and disclosure of detailed data, is the commercial confidentiality of the data.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Article 16 of the Convention provides for standard dispute resolution mechanisms including negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.
Future Role
With regard to the overriding priority facing CCSBT of the need to reach agreement between Members on the state of the SBT stock, several meeting were held in Japan during 1998. These meetings attempted to resolve the controversial issues and achieve consensus on how to sustainably manage SBT.
FORUM FISHERIES AGENCY
Area of Competence
: South Pacific (Central and Western)
Terms of Reference
Article VII of the Forum Fisheries Agency convention sets forth the functions of the agency that are to be performed by the secretariat, subject to the direction of the Committee. The Agency's main tasks are to:
* collect, analyze, evaluate and disseminate to members statistical and biological information concerning the region's living marine resources, particularly highly migratory species;
* collect and disseminate to members information about management procedures, legislation, agreements adopted by other countries, both within and beyond the region;
* collect and disseminate to members information about fish prices and the shipping, processing and marketing of fish and fish products;
* provide to members, as requested, technical advice and information, assistance in developing fisheries policies and negotiations, issuing fishing licenses, collecting fees, or maintaining surveillance and enforcement;
* seek to establish working arrangements with relevant regional and international organizations, in particular the Pacific Community (SPC); and
* undertake other functions determined by the committee.
Current Membership
Australia Nauru Samoa
Cook Islands New Zealand Solomon Islands
Federated States of Micronesia Niue Tonga
Fiji Palau Tuvalu
Kiribati Papua New Guinea Vanuatu
Marshall Islands
The Parties to the Convention meet once a year to provide detailed policy and administrative guidance and direction to the Agency. The Parties also consult on matters of common concern in the field of fisheries and promote intra-regional coordination and cooperation in:
* harmonization of policies with respect to fisheries management;
* cooperation in respect of:
* relations with distant water fishing nations;
* surveillance and enforcement;
* onshore fish processing; marketing; and
* access to the 200 mile zones of other Parties.
Current Considerations
In December 1997 the Majuro Declaration was adopted as a mechanism for applying principles of conservation and management to highly migratory stocks in the region. This is currently being expanded via a Multilateral High Level Conference to examine the establishment of a conservation and management regime in conformity with the provisions of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement for a greater region of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The Multilateral High Level Conference (meeting from 22-26 June 1998 in Tokyo) involved States and entities deemed to have a "real interest" in tuna fishing in the region. These were:
Australia Marshall Islands Republic of Korea
Cook Islands Nauru Samoa
Federated States of Micronesia New Caledonia Solomon Islands
Fiji New Zealand Taiwan Province of China
France Nieu Tonga
French Polynesia Palau Tuvalu
Indonesia Papua New Guinea United States of America
Japan People's Rep. of China Vanuatu
Kiribati Philippines
The Conference will reconvene in early 1999 in Hawaii, USA.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
There is provision within the Agreement to withdraw from the Convention, but no specific dispute mechanism exists.
Future Role
Formal resolutions within the Multilateral High-Level Conference on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific suggest a pivotal role for the future of the FFA. The Conference will reconvene early in 1999 to continue its work on negotiating the draft Convention. Among the issues that Conference participants are considering prior to the next session are:
* issues relating to allocation;
* the formula for financing the Commission, including the scale of contributions to the budget and the costs of the proposed institutional arrangements;
* minimum terms and conditions for fishing; and
* the regulation of transhipment.
INTERNATIONAL BALTIC SEA FISHERY COMMISSION
Area of Competence
Baltic Sea and the Belts. The area is a semi-enclosed sea covered by national fishing zones of the coastal States. There are no high seas within the area.
Terms of Reference
To keep the fisheries under review; to coordinate scientific research; to recommend regulatory measures including catch quotas and enforcement schemes.
Current Members
European Community
(representing Denmark, Germany, Finland and Sweden)
Estonia Latvia Lithuania
Poland Russia
These are all the Coastal States of the region. Annual member payments are calculated according to the formulae:
* one/third of the budget by equal shares; and
* two/thirds of the budget on the basis of the total allowable catch (TAC) allocations per Contracting Party.
All Contracting Parties attend all meetings of the Commission and they all participate in the programme activities of IBSFC. MCS and enforcement are the responsibility of Members.
Current Considerations
On the use of driftnets, the Commission has noted that the offshore fishery for salmon in the Baltic Sea is mainly a driftnet fishery. Driftnets and longlines together yield 70 percent of the total catch of salmon in the Baltic. Taking into account the small concentration of salmon in this large fishing area (catches amount to 2,800 tonnes per year), IBSFC claim that driftnets of a certain length are necessary for an economically viable fishery. IBSFC has further noted that the driftnet fishery is restricted by a closed season of four months each year. According to scientific information from ICES, by-catch of other species, including mammals and seabirds, is very small.
Regarding incidents of unauthorized fishing within the IBSFC area, the Commission has said that there are none.
Regulatory measures applied by IBSFC are in line with the objectives of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Increased attention is being given to the provisions of Article 7 on Fisheries Management, such as management objectives and application of the precautionary approach. Pending analysis by ICES, IBSFC intends to adopt within short stocks specific target reference points and limit reference points as provided for in Article 7.5.3 of the Code. At its Extraordinary Session on "Agenda 21 for the Baltic Sea Region" held in Warsaw, 16-20 February 1998, IBSFC adopted an "Action Programme for Sustainable Development" including targets, time-frames, actors and financing. The Action Programme includes:
* Baltic Cod Strategy Plan
* IBSFC Salmon Action Plan 1997-2010
* Long Term Strategy for Pelagic Species.
Data Supply and Disclosure
All Contracting Parties report to the Commission, through the Secretariat of the IBSFC, regularly according to the Statistical Programme of the Commission. Reports include:
* Report on the Utilization of the Baltic TACs established by the Commission for the preceding year (to be reported every year in May and submitted for consideration by the Commission at the annual Session in September);
* Reporting of quota transfers and exchanges of quotas with other Contracting Parties or third countries for the current year (deadline: 1 February);
* List of vessels authorized to fish Cod in the Baltic Sea in the current year reported by the Contracting Parties (no deadline);
* Reporting of licenses on private arrangements (those outside a fisheries agreement between Contracting Parties);
* Monthly catch statistics broken down by national fishery zone and management area;and
* Monthly statistics on landings of other Contracting Parties broken down by national fishery zone and species managed by IBSFC TACs.
At the annual IBSFC Session, held in September, the Contracting Parties report on their performance in implementing management measures. Note for example: Resolution VIII (1997) concerning the enforcement of the TACs in the Baltic Sea:
"The Contracting Parties to the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission undertake in the case of overfishing to submit a report to the Commission on why this has occurred and what measures will be taken to prevent future overfishing of TAC allocations."
IBSFC obtains every year scientific advice from ICES on the status of the main fish stocks in the region. All decisions of IBSFC are based on this advice. Each September, the TACs for the Baltic Sea and the fishing zones under the jurisdiction of its Contracting Parties, are established according to the main species and stocks:
* Herring;
* Sprat;
* Cod; and
* Salmon.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
IBSFC report that this is inapplicable to their RFB as in recent years the decisions of the Commission have been taken unanimously. Article XI of the Convention provides for objections to recommendations, but there are no specific provisions for conflict or dispute resolution.
Future Role
The Action Programme adopted in February 1998 includes forward management of Baltic Cod, Salmon (1997-2010) and Long-Term Strategy for Pelagic Species. IBSFC describe their future goals as the development of economically and socially sustainable, environmentally safe and responsible fisheries by:
* maintaining biologically viable fish stocks, the marine and aquatic environment and associated biodiversity;
* within these limits establishing maximum fishing possibilities and appropriate selective fishing techniques for harvesting stocks;
* distributing the direct and indirect benefits of open sea and coastal fishery resources between local communities in an equitable manner.
INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION
Area of Competence
: Tropical Tunas and tuna-like species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean
Terms of Reference
The I-ATTC fulfils its responsibilities with two programmes:
* the Tuna-Billfish Program, and
* the Tuna-Dolphin Program.
The principal responsibilities of the Tuna-Billfish Program are:
* to study the biology of the tunas and tuna-like species of the eastern Pacific Ocean to estimate the effects that fishing and natural factors have on their abundance, and
* to recommend appropriate conservation measures so that the stocks of fish can be maintained at levels which will afford maximum sustainable catches.
The principal responsibilities of the Tuna-Dolphin Program are:
* to monitor the abundance of dolphins and their mortality incidental to fishing through the collection of data aboard tuna purse seiners fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean,
* to analyze these data and make appropriate recommendations for the conservation of dolphins,
* to study the causes of mortality of dolphins during fishing operations and encourage fishermen to adopt fishing techniques which minimize the mortalities of dolphins, and
* to study the effects of different modes of fishing on the various fish and other animals of the pelagic ecosystem.
Current Membership
Costa Rica Japan United States of America
Ecuador Nicaragua Vanuatu
El Salvador Panama Venezuela
Mexico, Colombia and the European Community have indicated their intentions to adhere to, join, or rejoin, the I-ATTC. Meetings are well attended. All members and other countries which cooperate allow data collection from their surface fleets and provide data for other fishing methods. Colombia, Mexico, Spain participate in the associated International Program for the Conservation of Dolphins.
Incentives to encourage participation in the body include the opportunity to have fish certified as dolphin safe and to be recognized as fishing responsibly. There are no particular constraints preventing wider participation in the I-ATTC, but some States with vessels fishing in the area have not been Members in recent years because of policy disagreements with other Members.
Current Considerations
I-ATTC Bigeye Resolution of June 1998 notes the increase in annual bigeye tuna catches, particularly of small-and medium-sized fish and the consequent likelihood that this increase will lead to a reduction in overall catches of bigeye and other tunas and notes further the problems of by-catch of associated species which are discarded to the sea dead. In keeping with the provisions of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program, the Resolution concludes that action should be taken to reduce the catch of small bigeye tuna taken in the eastern Pacific Ocean to 45,000 metric tons in 1998, and that this limit is to be implemented by prohibiting sets on all types of floating objects at such time that the above limit is reached.
I-ATTC Fleet Capacity Resolution of June 1998 expresses concern that if the carrying capacity of the fleet is allowed to increase without restriction beyond its current level, the tuna stocks in the eastern Pacific Ocean may be reduced to levels less than those capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield. The Resolution concludes that measures should be taken to limit the growth in capacity of the international tuna purse-seine fleet operating in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
I-ATTC Yellowfin Resolution of June 1998 recognizes that the potential production from the yellowfin resource can be reduced by excessive fishing effort, and concludes that if conditions warrant, a limitation on the catch of yellowfin tuna should be implemented during 1998, but I-ATTC recommends to the High Contracting Parties that a quota of 210,000 tonnes be established for 1998 on the total catch of yellowfin tuna from the Commission's Yellowfin Regulatory Area (CYRA), and that the Director be authorized to increase this limit by up to three successive increments of 15,000 tonnes each if the Director concludes from examination of available data that such increases will pose no substantial danger to the stocks.
I-ATTC Convention Resolution of 17 June 1998, notes that its establishing Convention was signed in 1949, and therefore does not take into account subsequent changes in international law as reflected in the 1982 Convention, the Agenda 21 and Rio Declaration, the Compliance Agreement, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. The Commission agrees to establish a working group of its members, and open to other governments of coastal states and other States and regional economic integration organizations whose vessels are operating in the tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and which have the intention of adhering to the Convention, to review the functions of the I-ATTC and its Convention and, if necessary, formulate possible amendments to the Convention.
Data Supply and Disclosure
There has been for many years a yellowfin quota for the fishery. The quota is monitored via records of landings and estimated catches at sea. For most years since 1980 the catches have been less than the quota. Compliance with the International Program for the Conservation of Dolphins (IDCP) is monitored by observers on large vessels (i.e. those with a carrying capacity of greater than 400 short tons). Data for all fleets with the exception of distant water longline vessels are collected directly by I-ATTC staff. Members with distant water longline fleets are asked to provide data for their fleets. This can be problematic due to the timeliness of data obtained from vessels engaging in long fishing trips.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
All decisions are made by consensus.
Future Role
The Convention describes the role of the Commission as investigating the populations of tuna and other fish taken by tuna fishing vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and with making recommendations to keep the populations of fish at levels of abundance which will permit the maximum sustainable yield. This will continue to be the future role of I-ATTC, but with modifications to bring the body into line with contemporary international standards. The I-ATTC is also currently concerned with, and will continue to work on, fauna other than fish (e.g. dolphins and turtles).
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA
Area of Competence
: Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas with particular reference to the North Atlantic.
Terms of Reference
Article One of the 1964 ICES Convention identifies the Council's principle functions as:
* to promote and encourage research and investigations for the study of the sea particularly related to the living resources thereof;
* to draw up programmes required for this purpose and to organize, in agreement with the Contracting Parties, such research and investigations as may appear necessary; and
* to publish and otherwise disseminate the results of research and investigations carried out under its auspices or to encourage the publication thereof.
Current Membership
Belgium Germany Portugal
Canada Iceland Russia
Denmark Ireland Spain
(inc. Faroe Islands and Greenland) Latvia Sweden
Estonia the Netherlands United Kingdom
Finland Norway United States of America
France Poland
Members pay directly to ICES, with large fishing States paying more than smaller fishing States. Those Commissions (such as IBSFC) that receive advice from ICES pay directly to ICES for such advice. (Australia, South Africa and Greece have observer status). ICES conduct an annual Science Conference which is well attended by Member Parties and attracts around 500 participants. Scientists from developing countries can be involved via national members of ICES on special request, however the advisory work of the Council is restricted to member countries.
Current Considerations
In addition to their scientific advisory role, ICES is currently working on implementing their Report on the Precautionary approach to Fisheries Management. Further, the problems of fishery by-catch and discards have led to ICES establishing a large scale sampling program. After three years of implementing this program, data is beginning to come through for analysis and future incorporation into ICES models.
Data Supply and Disclosure
ICES collects annual stock statistics both from States and from independent scientists. In particular, misreporting and illegal fishing are reported by scientists. Data relates to yearly catch by States, and is further classified according to stock and biological data including age distribution, weight at age, migration and spawning data, and survey participation. ICES analyzes this data and calculates stock sizes, recruitment and fishing mortality. These parameters guide ICES in its judgement of how effective is compliance with the international legal regime for fisheries. Generally there are no significant restraints on data collection. The only minor exception to this is lack of detailed data from fishing fleets in the North Sea where some States are reluctant to allow access for various reasons including secrets of fishing areas.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
If managers have a dispute/conflict for which they need biological advice, ICES can with short notice, involve its advisory bodies. However, the normal process is for managers to annually ask ICES a set of questions for which they want biological advice. These questions are mainly related to what the TAC should be next year, but can also address special issues relating to closed areas for fishing, and the effects of fishing.
Future Role
ICES anticipate that their advisory task will continue to be important in fisheries conservation and management into the next century. It is anticipated that their future work will develop a more ecosystem/holistic approach to fisheries.
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS
Area of Competence
: Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas including the Caribbean/Mediterranean Seas.
Terms of Reference
The Governments of the Contracting Parties to the Convention have a mutual interest in the populations of tuna and tuna-like fishes found in the Atlantic Ocean and subscribe to carrying out the objective of the Convention, which is to cooperate in maintaining the populations of these fishes at levels which will permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes. This mandate includes about 30 species, among them some commercially importantspecies, such as Atlantic bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, albacore and bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, swordfish, billfishes such as blue and white marlins, and sailfish the Spanish mackerel family, such as spotted Spanish mackerel, king mackerel, as well as small tunas, such as black skipjack, frigate tuna, and Atlantic bonito.
To carry out its objectives, the Commission is responsible for the study of tunas and tuna-like fishes and such other species of fishes exploited in tuna fishing in the Convention area. Such studies include research on abundance, biometry, and the ecology of the fishes, the oceanography of their environment, as well as the effects of natural and human factors on their abundance. The Commission's work also involves the collecting and analyzing of statistical information relative to current conditions and trends of the tuna fishery resources in the Convention area.
Current Members

China (People's Republic of) Libya Venezuela
Cote d'Ivoire Morocco
Equatorial Guinea Panama
France (S. Pierre et Miquelon) Russian Federation
Guinea (Republic of) Sao Tome and Principe
European Community South Africa
Participation in meetings and programme activities varies according to State political interest and economic capability.
Current Considerations
The Commission recommended various management measures based on scientific findings. These measures include: catch limits (on bluefin tuna, albacore, bigeye tuna, swordfish, and billfishes); effort restriction (yellowfin and bigeye tunas); minimum size (swordfish and yellowfin, bigeye and bluefin tunas); time-area closure (bluefin, yellowfin and bigeye tunas). The implementation of the recommendations are the responsibility of national governments. The current major concern of the Commission is 1) allocations of TAC among countries and 2) compliance to the regulatory measures (particularly by non-contracting parties). In order to solve this problem, the Commission adopted action plans for bluefin and swordfish, which consist step by step actions, to enforce the regulations to non-collaborating countries (mostly of flag of convenience). All the bluefin tuna imported to the contracting parties have to have a government certificate on the origins. Together with other actions
taken by the Commission (e.g. sighting report of fishing vessels of non-compliance, prohibition of transshipment at sea) the Commission identified those countries which are undermining the effect of the regulatory measures taken, warned to those countries and if these counties did not rectify the illegal operations, the Commission recommends the Contracting parties to take multi-lateral, non-prejudiced trade measures.
Data Supply and Disclosure
In accordance with the Convention, four panels have been established based on species, group of species or geographic area. Each panel is responsible for keeping under review, on the basis of scientific research, such species as are under its purview. These are:
* Panel 1 - Tropical Tunas (Yellowfin, Skipjack and Bigeye);
* Panel 2 - North Temperate Tunas (albacore and bluefin);
* Panel 3 - South Temperate Tunas (albacore and southern bluefin); and
* Panel 4 - Others (Swordfish, Billfishes and Small Tunas).
A Compliance Committee is mandated to review the status of the Contracting Parties' compliance with the regulatory measures recommended by the Commission, to consider any infractions, and to seek effective ways to enforce regulations.
The Permanent Working Group on ICCAT Statistics and Conservation Measures reviews the status of compliance or non-compliance of ICCAT conservation and management measures by non-Contracting Parties, to take effective action to encourage and enforce the Commission's measures by such Parties.
The Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), on which each member country of the Commission may be represented, is responsible for collecting most complete and current fishery statistics as well as biological information, based on which the stock assessments are made and the conclusions are reported to the Commission for their actions.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
Bilateral disputes are resolved between States. When regulations are recommended, each member has six months to present objections. After 60 days more of confirmation, the regulations become into effect except for those who objected and confirmed the objections. A Compliance Committee (formerly called the Infractions Committee) exists to review the status of the Contracting Parties' compliance with the regulatory measures recommended by the Commission. The Compliance Committee considers any infractions, and there are certain provision of penalties for infractions, including trade measures. .
Future Role
ICCAT have been considering the new international instruments (e.g. UN agreement on fish stocks, FAO Compliance Agreement, Code of Conducts for responsible fishing), and its applicatgions to the ICCAT work. h. Most of the principles in these instruments will help the Commission's work , as well as the Commission is tryijng to introduce these principle as much as possible, even amending the Convention.
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES ORGANIZATION
Area of Competence
: Northwest Atlantic Ocean
Terms of Reference
To promote the conservation and optimum utilization of the fishery resources of the Northwest Atlantic area within a framework appropriate to the regime of extended Coastal State jurisdiction over fisheries, and accordingly to encourage international cooperation and consultation with respect to these resources:
"The contracting Parties agree to establish and maintain an international organization whose object shall be to contribute to the optimum utilization, rational management and conservation of the fishery resources of the Convention Area."

Current Considerations
Regarding large scale pelagic driftnets, there have been no reports of this activity in the NAFO Convention Area during 1997-8. On the subject of unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, there have been no reports of this within national jurisdictions. For high seas fishing, the General Council of NAFO has been working on the problem of non-Contracting Party fishing activity in the NAFO Regulatory Area and subsequently adopted a "Scheme to Promote Compliance by Non-Contracting Party Vessels with the Conservation and Enforcement Measures Established by NAFO". The Scheme presumes that a non-Contracting Party vessel which has been sighted engaging in fishing activities in the NAFO Regulatory Area is undermining the NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures. If such sighted vessels enter the ports of Contracting Parties, they must be inspected. No landings or transhipments will be permitted in Contracting Party ports unless such vessels can
establish that certain species on board were not caught in the NAFO Regulatory Area, and for certain other species that the vessel applied the NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures. Contracting Parties must report the results of inspections to NAFO and all Contracting Parties. It should also be noted that an additional attempt to remedy the problem of non-Contracting Party fishing in the NAFO Regulatory Area came when the President of NAFO, A.Rodin (Russia) signed diplomatic demarches to the flag-States whose vessels fish in the NAFO Regulatory Area in 1996-1997, namely Belize, Honduras, Panama and Sierra Leone. Concerning the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, NAFO is continuing to investigate their implementation.
Finally, on the subject of by-catch and discards, the Organization is elaborating regulatory measures that constitute a legal basis and guidelines for the NAFO inspectors and observers on these issues. Observers on board fishing vessels monitor all by-catch and discards and provide their reports to the NAFO Secretariat.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Article II of the NAFO Convention decrees that the Organization shall consist of (inter alia) a Scientific Council, and Article VI provides that the functions of this Council are to:
* provide a forum for consultation and cooperation among the Contracting Parties with respect to the study, appraisal and exchange of scientific information and views relating to the fisheries of the Convention Area, including environmental and ecological factors affecting these fisheries, and to encourage and promote cooperation among the Contracting Parties in scientific research designed to fill gaps in knowledge pertaining to these matters;
* compile and maintain statistics and records and publish or disseminate reports, information and materials pertaining to the fisheries of the Convention Area, including environmental and ecological factors affecting these fisheries;
* provide scientific advice to coastal States, where requested to do so pursuant to Article VII, and
* provide scientific advice to the Fisheries Commission, pursuant to Article VIII or on its own initiative as required for the purposes of the Commission.
Further, Article VI paragraph (3) provides that the Contracting Parties shall furnish to the Scientific Council any available statistical and scientific information requested by the Council for the purpose of this Article.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
The Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries includes the following provisions. Article X provides that scientific advice provided by the Scientific Council is to be determined by consensus. Where consensus cannot be achieved, the Council shall set out in its report all views advanced on the matter under consideration. Further, Article XII(1) provides that if any Commission member presents an objection to a proposal within sixty days, the proposal shall not become a binding measure until the expiration of forty days, and in this period other Commission members may also object. When the proposal comes into effect it is a binding measure on all contracting Parties, except those which have presented objections. Where a majority of Commission members have objected, the proposal shall not become a binding measure, unless members nevertheless agree among themselves to be bound.

JOINT TECHNICAL COMMISSION FOR THE ARGENTINA/URUGUAY MARITIME BOUNDARY
Area of Competence
The Common Fishing Zone which overlaps a large sector of the economic exclusive zone of Argentina and Uruguay. The Treaty delimitates the Common Fishing Zone in Article 73 of the Tratado del Rio de la Plata y su Frente Maritimo (Agreement on the Plate River and Ocean Areas Adjacent and Beyond the River) 19th November, 1973, which provides,
"The Parties Agree to establish a common fishing zone, beyond the 12 nautical miles, measured from the corresponding coastal baselines, for duly registered vessels flying their flag. Such zone shall be determined by two arcs of circumference of a radius of 200 nautical miles, the centres of which are located at Punta del Este (Republica Oriental del Uruguay) and Punta Rasa del Cabo San Antonio (Argentine Republic) respectively."
Terms of Reference
Article 80 of the Treaty provides that:
"The Parties hereby set up a Joint Technical Commission, consisting of an equal number of representatives from each Party, which shall be responsible for conducting studies and adopting and coordinating plans and measures for the conservation, preservation and rational exploitation of living resources and the protection of the marine environment in common zone established in Article 73."
The functions of the Commission are expanded by Article 82 of the Treaty which provides inter alia for:
* the establishment and periodic adjustment of species catch volume and share;
* joint conduct of scientific studies and research with special reference to the evaluation, conservation, preservation and rational exploitation of living marine resources, and the prevention and elimination of pollution and other harmful effects;
* recommendations and projects for ensuring the value, balance and maintenance of bi-ecological systems;
* establishing norms for the rational exploitation of species in the common zone and the prevention and elimination of pollution; and
* promoting studies and presenting projects for harmonizing the laws of the two Parties governing matters with which the Commission is entrusted.
Current Members
Republica Argentina Republica Oriental del Uruguay
The budget of the Commission is covered by contributions from both Governments. The Commission was established in 1976 and has operated permanently since this time. The Plenary of the Commission meets on a monthly basis. The Commission has a permanent Secretariat and a number of specialized subcommissions.
Current Considerations
The two most important current considerations of the Commission are continuing fisheries management of the main commercial species in the Common Fishing Zone, but done in accordance with policy on environmental protection. Thus closed areas and maximum catch limits are used in respect of the main commercial catch species of hake (Merluccius hubbsi), croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) and striped weakfish (Cyonoscion striatus). In order to ensure compliance, the Resolutions provide for procedures for the application of fines. There are also requirements relating to minimum mesh sizes for bottom trawling nets and for use in the hake fishery.
Data Supply and Disclosure
The Commission has a number of subcommissions and task groups specializing in specific subject areas, such as hake, croaker, marine environment, etc. The Parties exchange data between these subcommissions on a regular basis. Since 1984 the Commission has undertaken 46 joint cruises with research ships of the Parties, and a further 15 joint cruises by smaller fishing vessels for a study on the population dynamics of croaker stocks and the impact of environmental factors. In addition the Parties engage in their own separate research programmes within the Common Fishing Zone. In recent times the Commission is giving increased attention to species other than the main commercial species, including squid. There are no restraints on reporting data.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Lapeyre notes:
"The Commission has evolved into a forum for the discussion and resolution of issues that, from time to time, inevitably may emerge in the case of shared resources. The existence of this permanent organization enables the parties to advance in the calm study of those issues and contributes to the finding of conciliatory formulae which may help to harmonize their interests. In this respect it is possible to state that no exchange of notes, nor diplomatic protests, on any of the subject areas within the jurisdiction of the Commission, has taken place since its installation...Although the Commission has basically a technical-scientific structure, it provides support, when the circumstances so demand, for political-diplomatic negotiations."
The Treaty provides that any dispute that cannot be solved by direct negotiations, may be submitted by either Party to the International Court of Justice. This procedure has never been used.
Future Role
The Commission is likely to expand its role of fisheries management within the Common Fishing Zone. This will be done in conjunction with increasing environmental protection.
NORTH ATLANTIC MARINE MAMMAL COMMISSION
Area of Competence
There is no precise delimitation of the NAMMCO area by lines of longitude and latitude. The area of competence is described as the North Atlantic and the species covered are all marine mammals within this area.
Terms of Reference:
The objective of the Commission is to contribute through regional consultation and cooperation to the conservation, rational management and study of marine mammals in the North Atlantic. The Commission consists of:
* a Council;
* Management Committees;
* a Scientific Committee; and
* a Secretariat.
Management Committees, with respect to stocks of marine mammals within their respective mandates:
* propose to their members measures for conservation and management, and
* make recommendations to the Council concerning scientific research.
Current Members
As of January 1994, the members of the Commission were as follows:
Faroe Islands
Greenland
Iceland
Norway
Other states may adhere to the Agreement subject to the consent of the existing signatories.
Current Considerations:
The Report of the Sixth Meeting of the NAMMCO Scientific Committee held in Reykjavik, Iceland, 1-5 March 1998, notes work that has been done on stock assessments of harp seals, hooded seals, ringed seals, harbour porpoises, Central North Atlantic minke whales, narwhals and belugas. In addition, a Scientific Committee Working Group has examined economic aspects of marine mammal - fisheries interactions.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
All decisions of the Council and Management Committees are taken by the unanimous vote of those members present and casting an affirmative vote.
Future Role:
To deal with the request for a population status of narwhals and belugas, a Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhals and Belugas in the North Atlantic has been established and will meet in 1999. A workshop/symposium on harbour porpoise is being considered as a future activity.
NORTH ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION
Area of Competence
Article 1(1) of the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean applies to salmon stocks which migrate beyond areas of fisheries jurisdiction of coastal States of the Atlantic Ocean north of 36^O N latitude throughout their migratory range.
Terms of Reference
The objective of NASCO as outlined in Article 3(2) of the Convention is to contribute through consultation and cooperation to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks subject to the Convention, and taking into account the best scientific evidence available to it.
Current Members
Canada Iceland
Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands Norway
and Greenland) Russian Federation
European Community United States of America
NASCO has granted observer status to 24 non-government organizations. In accordance with Article 16(2) of the Convention, the Organization is funded by the Contracting Parties according to the following formula:
* 30 percent of the budget is divided equally among the Parties; and
* 70 percent of the budget is divided among the Parties in proportion to their nominal catches of salmon subject to the Convention in the calendar year ending not more than 18 months and not less than 6 months before the beginning of the financial year.
Members participate 100 percent in the work and programmes of the Organization. All Contracting Parties have been represented at each of the Annual Meetings conducted since the inaugural meeting in 1984.
Current Considerations
The 1995-97 Report on the Activities of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization noted that during the period covered by the Report,
"NASCO has continued to broaden its competence to address new measures as they arise. It is clear from the database on salmon rivers, which NASCO has established, that about 13percent (approximately 240 rivers) of the 1900 salmon rivers in the North Atlantic area are considered to be threatened with loss and 6.5percent (120 rivers) have been lost to salmon production. The challenge facing NASCO and its Contracting Parties is to rebuild the stocks which are threatened and to restore those which have been lost."
Measures currently being taken by NASCO to conserve, restore, and enhance stocks for rational management include:
* establishment of regulatory measures in response to declining stock levels;
* application of a Precautionary approach;
* further development of measures (and their effective implementation) to minimise the impacts of aquaculture and of introductions and transfers;
* development of measures to reduce the level of unreported catches; and
* assessing the by-catch of salmon in pelagic fisheries.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Under Article 15 of the Convention, each Party shall:
1. provide to the Council available catch statistics for salmon stocks subject to the Convention taken in its rivers and area of fisheries jurisdiction;
1. compile and provide to the Council such other statistics for salmon stocks subject to the Convention as required by the Council;
2. provide the Council with any other available scientific and statistical information which it requires for the purposes of the Convention;
3. upon the request of the Council each Party shall provide to the Council copies of laws, regulations and programmes in force or, where appropriate, summaries thereof relating to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks subject to the Convention in its rivers and area of fisheries jurisdiction.
4. Notify the Council each year of:
* the adoption or repeal since its last notification of laws, regulations and programmes relating to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks subject to the Convention in its rivers and area of fisheries jurisdiction;
* any commitments by the responsible authorities concerning the adoption or maintenance in force for specified periods of time within its territory or area of fisheries jurisdiction of measures relating to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks subject to the Convention;
* factors within its territory and area of fisheries jurisdiction which may significantly affect the abundance of salmon stocks subject to the Convention.
There have been no main constraints to reporting or disclosing data, but in 1997 the Council recognized that there had been a problem in relation to reporting of measures taken in relation to its Resolution by the Parties to the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean to Minimise Impacts from Salmon Aquaculture on the Wild Salmon Stocks. A revised format for submissions of the information by the Parties was agreed to in 1998.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Decisions of the three Commissions (North-East Atlantic, North American and West Greenland) require unanimous agreement. Decisions of the Council are in the main taken bythree-quarters majority of the vote of the members.
Future Role
The 1995-97 Report on the Activities of the NASCO notes in part:
"To mark the Organization's Tenth Anniversary, the Council ...took a forward look at the future issues which might be faced in achieving the objectives of the Convention. While the Council is already addressing a wide range of issues, new threats to the well-being of wild salmon stocks arise with surprising speed. For example, when the Organization was established in 1984 few would have anticipated that five years later vessels registered in South America would be fishing for salmon in the North Atlantic. [Similarly] when the Council first began to consider the future issues it was reported that the whole issue of transgenic salmon was an issue that would present itself some time into the future. Six months later transgenic fish were being reared experimentally in aquaculture."
The new issues identified as requiring further consideration, and to serve as a basis for the future work of the Organization include:
* increased cooperation between the Parties on freshwater issues such as pollution and habitat damage which cause great losses of salmon;
* how to adopt the Precautionary approach to NASCO's work in order to safeguard wild salmon stocks; [ a draft Action Plan is currently being developed on the application of the Precautionary approach to the Organization's work];
* the Organization's working methods including its relations with non-government and inter-government organizations;
* global warming and its possible impact on salmon distribution; and
* the role NASCO could play in educating the young on salmon conservation and management issues.
NORTH EAST ATLANTIC FISHERIES COMMISSION
Area of Competence:
The Convention Area applies:
* to the waters of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and their dependent seas which lie north of 36^0 north latitude and between 42^0 west longitude and 51^0 east longitude but excluding:
* the Baltic Sea and the Belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from Hasenore Head to Gniben Point, from Korshage to Spodsbierg and from Gilbierg Head to the Kullen, and
* the Mediterranean Sea and its dependent seas as far as the point of intersection of the parallel of 36^0 latitude and the meridian of 5^036' west longitude,
* within that part of the Atlantic Ocean north of 59^0 north latitude and between 44^0 west longitude and 42^0 west longitude.
Terms of Reference:
The Convention states the desire to:
"promote the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North-East Atlantic area within a framework appropriate to the regime of extended coastal state jurisdiction over fisheries, and accordingly to encourage international co-operation and consultation with respect to these resources."
Current Membership:
Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands and Greenland) Norway
European Community Poland
Iceland Russian Federation
The Commission adopts a budget at each annual meeting with contracting party financial contributions calculated according to the following criteria:
* one-third of the budget divided equally among the contracting parties,
* two-thirds of the budget divided among the contracting parties in proportion of their nominal catches in the Convention Area, on the basis of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea definitive catch statistics for the calendar year ending not more than 24 and not less than 18 months before the beginning of the budget year,
* however, the annual contribution of any Contracting Party which has a population of less than 300,000 inhabitants is limited to a maximum of 5percent of the total budget. When this contribution is so limited, the remaining part of the budget shall be divided among the other Contracting Parties in accordance with sub-paragraphs (a) and (b).
In recent years participation has been virtually 100 percent by contracting parties with occasional attendance by observers representing ICES, Japan, Canada, Estonia, Latvia, Lituania, and the Ukraine.
Current Considerations:
The most important issues facing the organisation at present are the future structure of the organisation and the move to instituting an independent Secretariat, the introduction of a comprehensive control and enforcement scheme and decisions on which stocks/species are to be regulated. Other issues being actively addressed include the application of the precautionary approach, dealing with unauthorised fishing and transparency of NEAFC proceedings.
Data Supply and Disclosure:
The Contracting Parties are required to submit lists of authorized fishing vessels which are made available to all other Contracting Parties. Contracting Parties are required to submit catch data for regulated species to the Secretariat on a weekly basis. This information is then made available to other contracting parties in a consolidated fashion on a monthly basis. These requirements have been met in recent years. Data collected by the Secretariat is only made available outside the organization with the permission of the Commission. The Secretariat has an obligation to maintain confidentiality of data supplied.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms:
There is no dispute settlement procedure. The Convention provides for an objection procedure and a recommendation will not become binding on any Contracting Party which maintains an objection.
Future Role:
A Working Group is currently considering the matter of the future role of NEAFC. The terms of reference state the objective to:
"evaluate the structure and function of the Commission,
1. measured against the provisions of the Convention, and
1. in light of the UNCLOS and the development of relevant international law, in particular the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries."
INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC HALIBUT COMMISSION
Area of Competence
The Convention waters of the IPHC are the waters off the west coasts of Canada and the United States, including the southern as well as the western coasts of Alaska, within the respective areas in which either Party exercises exclusive fisheries jurisdiction.
For the purposes of the Convention, the "maritime areas" in which a Party exercises exclusive fisheries jurisdiction includes without distinction areas within and seaward of the territorial sea or internal waters of that Party. In short, this means the waters encompassing the range of Pacific halibut in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Bering and Chukchi Seas, but not excluding other maritime waters of either contracting Party where halibut may occur.
Terms of Reference
The Convention establishing the Commission in 1923, and modified by protocol in 1979, provides, inter alia:
"For the purposes of developing the stocks of halibut of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea to levels which will permit the optimum yield from that fishery, ... the Commission, with the approval of the Parties, ...may ...
* divide the Convention waters into areas;
* establish one or more open or closed seasons as to each area;
* limit the size of the fish and the quantity of the catch to be taken from each area within any season during which fishing is allowed;
* permit, limit, regulate or prohibit the incidental catch of halibut that may be taken, retained, possessed, or landed from each area or portions of an area, by vessels fishing for other species of fish;
* fix the size and character of halibut fishing appliances to be used in any area;
* make such regulations for the licensing of vessels and for the collection of statistics on the catch of halibut as it shall find necessary ...; and
* close to all taking of halibut any area or portion of an area that the Commission finds to be populated by small, immature halibut and designates as nursery grounds."
Current Members
Canada
United States of America
Each party currently contributes US$800,000 per annum. Both Parties participate fully in the scheduled Annual and Interim meetings of the Commission, and remit appropriations on schedule.
Current Considerations
There are four primary considerations currently facing IPHC. These are:
* the control of by-catch mortality of halibut in non-target fisheries;
* determination of the effects of oceanographic/meteorological forcing factors on halibut dynamics;
* funding of the Commission activities, and
* constant evaluation of harvest policy.
Data Supply and Disclosure
Contracting Parties authorize the Commission to collect fishery statistics directly but this also occurs in conjunction with domestic agencies. The Commission creates and maintains the official databases pertaining to halibut fisheries. Both parties cooperate fully in disclosure, including electronic transfer of records, etc. for commercial fisheries but data from recreational fisheries for halibut are collected and reported to the Commission by the domestic agencies of the Parties.
The Commission passes regulations, including fishing quotas, every year at its annual meeting. The two Parties are required by the Convention to mirror these regulations in their domestic regulations pertaining to fishing in the waters of the two parties. In this sense there is an absolute compliance with Commission decisions and the reporting of implementation is not an issue.
There are no real constraints on data supply by industry or domestic fishery agencies.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
The Convention does not contain a dispute settlement clause. Instead, it implies that the Parties will come to agreement on disputes. Regulatory measures are voted on by the six Commissioners (three from each party) and a simple majority is required for approval. Disputes are extremely rare in the Commission forum. Where disputes have happened, government-to-government discussions have resolved the issue, or the two governments have directed the Commission and its staff to continue working until the dispute is resolved. This mechanism has yet to fail.
Future Role
The Commission does not anticipate any significant changes in its future role. The Commission has strong support from stakeholders, even during a transition to individual quota management within the fleets of the two Parties. The two Parties have retained authority for allocation decisions within the user groups of each country but the Commission retains the authority to set overall yield levels, conduct the research necessary to determine these levels, and maintain the infrastructure for fisheries and research databases.
NORTH PACIFIC ANADROMOUS FISH COMMISSION
Area of Competence
The area to which the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean applies is the waters of the North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas, north of 33^0 N. Latitude beyond the 200 mile zones of the coastal States. For scientific purposes the activities under the Convention may extend farther southward in the North Pacific Ocean beyond the 200 mile zones.
Terms of Reference
The Convention is based on the recognition that Anadromous stocks intermingle extensively during their migration on the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean, and that the States or origin have the primary interest in and responsibility for such stocks. Further, that the fisheries for anadromous stocks should be conducted only in waters within the 200 mile zones and that the States of origin make expenditures and forego economic development opportunities to establish favorable conditions to conserve and manage these stocks.
The Convention also recognizes the importance of scientific research for the conservation of Anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean and the desire of the major States of origin to promote the acquisition, analysis and dissemination of scientific information pertaining to anadromous stocks and ecologically related species in the North Pacific Ocean as well as to coordinate efforts and to establish an effective mechanism of international cooperation for their conservation.
The goal of conservation is consolidated by such measures as:
* prohibition of directed fishing for Anadromous fish in the Convention Area;
* minimization to the maximum extent of the incidental taking of Anadromous fish; and
* prohibition of the retention on board a fishing vessel of anadromous fish taken as an incidental catch during fishing for non-Anadromous fish.
Current Members
Canada Russian Federation
Japan United States of America
Parties make equal annual contributions and participate equally in the operation of the Commission.
Other States may accede to the Convention at the invitation of the Original Parties by unanimous agreement. The Convention shall become effective for any such other State on the date of deposit of that State's instrument of accession.
The Parties invite the attention of any State or entity not party to the Convention to any matter relating to their fishing activity which could negatively affect the conservation of Anadromous stocks within the Convention Area and agree to encourage them to adopt laws and regulations consistent with the provisions of the Convention. Furthermore, the Parties take action individually or collectively in accordance with international and their respective domestic laws to prevent unauthorized fishing activities by any State or entity not party to the Convention and trafficking in illegally harvested anadromous fish.
Current Considerations
The only managerial measure the Commission undertakes is prohibition of the direct fishing for salmon in the Convention Area, consolidated by the minimizing to the maximum extent of any incidental taking of this fish. The scientific research of Anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean, conducted by the Parties on a cooperative and coordinating basis, is used, inter alia, for stock assessment. In March 1998, NPAFC conducted a Workshop on Climate Change and Salmon Production. This workshop has led to the NPAFC Technical Report on Climate Change and Salmon Production No. 1.
Data Supply and Disclosure
The Convention provides for the Parties to cooperate in the conduct of scientific research in the Convention Area, which may include, as appropriate, research on other ecologically related species. The Parties also cooperate in collecting, reporting and exchanging biostatistical information, fisheries data, including catch and fishing effort statistics, biological samples and other relevant data pertinent to the purposes of the Convention. The Convention further provides for the exchange of information on any activities contrary to the provisions of the Convention, especially with respect to fishing for and trafficking in Anadromous fish, as well as on responsive action taken by the Parties and, as appropriate, by any State or entity not party to the Convention. There are no particular problems with data supply and disclosure.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
The Convention provides that each Party has one vote in the Commission. All important matters shall be decided by consensus among all Parties that are States of origin of Anadromous stocks which migrate into the Convention Area. A matter shall be deemed to be important if any Party that is a State of origin of Anadromous stocks which migrate into the Convention Area considers it to be important. Any Party may withdraw from the Convention, twelve months after the date of formal notification of such intention.
Future Role
The NPAFC will continue to play a positive role in the conservation of Anadromous stocks of the North Pacific Ocean. Future issues concern the accession to the Convention by Republic of Korea and China, increased cooperation with international organizations, achieving compliance by third parties with the provisions of the Convention, encouraging States and entities which are not Party to the Convention to deposit instruments of acceptance of the Compliance Agreement, and the further development of coordination and cooperation in scientific research.
NORTH PACIFIC MARINE SCIENCE ORGANIZATION
Area of Competence
North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas (in particular, northward from 30^ON)
Terms of Reference
The purpose of PICES is to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance scientific knowledge of the North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas, and its living resources, including but not necessarily limited to research with respect to the ocean environment and its interactions with land and atmosphere; its role in and response to global weather and climate change; its flora, fauna and ecosystems; its uses and resources, and impact upon it from human activities; and to promote the collection and exchange of information and data related to marine scientific research in the area concerned.
Current Members
Canada Korea, Republic of China, People's Republic of
Russian Federation Japan United States of America
The current budget is approximately Canadian $500,000 shared equally among members.
Current Considerations
The issues currently being discussed in PICES range from the short-term (El Niño repercussions) to the long-term (regime shifts) related to ocean climate and carrying capacity (primarily in relation to salmon). PICES provides a focus for discussion of North Pacific marine science issues and attendance of scientists from the Member States is still increasing as the work of PICES becomes better known.
Data Supply and Disclosure
The PICES parties have specifically indicated that they do not want PICES to develop an archive of data. PICES promotes the exchange of data and so far this is being done at an individual scientist level. PICES recently facilitated providing ocean station PAPA plankton data electronically and by disc at the request of Canadian scientists. There was significant interest in this data from both sides of the Pacific. Parties are not required to provide specific types of data to PICES.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
There are no mechanisms for conflict/dispute resolution.
Future Role
Through the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity Programme, PICES is starting to look at developing a joint research program that can only be undertaken by cooperation, such as jointly authored papers. A Climate Change and Carrying Capacity Program Workshop was conducted in October, 1998. In addition, another workshop will examine improvements in the monitoring of the Subarctic Pacific to further understand the effects of climate variations on the marine ecosystems of the Subarctic North Pacific.
If Parties could agree, PICES could provide an advisory role on fisheries and other marine science issues that would be beneficial to all Parties through a multidisciplinary approach. On this point, it should be noted that PICES is the only organization in the North Pacific that regularly brings together all the disciplines from marine science, whereas other organizations are focused on fisheries, and primarily attract only fishery biologists. The Convention makes provision for PICES to provide advice, and respond to other questions on marine science from the Parties, in much the same manner as occurs in ICES. However, this procedure has not yet developed within PICES to the level of ICES.
PACIFIC SALMON COMMISSION
Area of Competence
The 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty establishes a PSC formed by the governments of Canada and the United States of America. It has responsibility for all Salmon originating in the waters of one country which are subject to interception by the other, affect management of the other country's salmon or affect biologically the stocks of the other country. In addition, the PSC is charged with taking into account the conservation of steelhead trout while fulfilling its other functions. There are three regional panels - the Southern, Northern, and Fraser River panels to provide technical and regulatory advice to the Commission.
Terms of Reference
The fundamental role of the PSC is two-fold:
* first, to conserve the Pacific Salmon in order to achieve optimum production, and
* second, to divide the harvests so that each country reaps the benefits of its investment in salmon management.
To achieve its mandate, the PSC may recommend that the countries implement harvest limitations, time and area closures, gear restrictions, or other measures to control harvests. In addition, the Commission may recommend the use of enhancement techniques to strengthen weak runs, mitigate for damage done by logging, mining or dam-building, or for other purposes.
Current Members
Canada
United States of America
Data Supply and Disclosure
The panels provide recommendations and comment on the management of the fisheries in their area of responsibility before and after each season's harvest. This is done by reviewing technical data on annual fishing plans and regulations, and the salmon enhancement programmes of each country. Panels provide the Commission with specific recommendations for the development of fishery plans. Agreement of both sides is needed for any decision or recommendation. The Fraser River Panel is unique in that it has responsibility for inseason harvest regulations of Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon within a specified area. Panel recommendations are based on information received by the panels from a variety of bilateral technical committees. Those committees rely upon information provided by Canadian and US fishery management agencies.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Article XII of the Treaty provides for Technical Dispute Settlement. By the provisions, either Party may submit to the Chairperson of the Commission a matter concerning estimates of the extent of salmon interceptions and data related to questions of overfishing for referral to a Technical Dispute Settlement Board. The Board makes findings of fact on the dispute. The findings of the Board are final and without appeal, and shall be accepted by the Commission as the best scientific information available. Either Party may, by application in writing to the Chairperson of the Board, request a reconsideration of a finding of a Board, provided that such request is based on information not previously considered by the Board. The Chairperson shall, if possible, refer the request to a new Board.
SOUTH PACIFIC PERMANENT COMMISSION
Area of Competence
The Agreement on the Organization of the Permanent Commission of the Conference on the Use and Conservation of the Maritime Resources of the South Pacific does not define the precise area to be served by the Commission. Rather it provides that the Permanent Commission is established in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the Declaration on the Maritime Zone. This Declaration states that the three Governments of Chile, Ecuador and Peru proclaim as a principle of their international maritime policy that each of them possesses sole sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area of the sea, the sea floor and sub-soil thereof adjacent to the coast of its own country and extending not less than 200 nautical miles from the said coast. In 1984, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of CPPS member countries referred to the "legitimate interests of the Coastal States in the conservation and optimum utilization of the marine resources beyond their 200 mile zones, or populations of
species associated with them." They instructed the CPPS Secretariat to take action with a view to considering the possibility of establishing adequate mechanisms for the conservation and optimum utilization of these resources. The species covered by the Agreement are all living marine resources.
Terms of Reference
The objectives of the Agreement are those set out in the Declaration on Maritime Zone. The objectives of the Declaration are, inter alia, the necessity to provide for the peoples of the three governments food supplies and to furnish them with the means of developing their economy. To do this, it is essential to ensure the conservation and protection of their natural resources in the areas of the sea adjacent to their coasts and to regulate the use thereof.
The functions of the Commission are, inter alia:
* to determine protected species; open and closed seasons and areas of sea; fishing and hunting times; methods and equipment; prohibited gear and methods; and to lay down general regulations for hunting and fishing,
* to study and propose to the Parties such measures as it considers suitable for the protection, defence, conservation and use of marine resources,
* to encourage scientific and technical study of, and research into, biological phenomena in the South Pacific, and
* to prepare general statistics of the industrial use of marine resources by the Parties, and to suggest protective measures based on the study thereof.
Current Members:
Chile Ecuador Colombia Peru
Neither the Agreement establishing the Commission, nor any of the Declarations, resolutions or recommendations of the Commission mention conditions regarding eligibility for membership. Contributions are from the four member countries and the budget is approved through official meetings. The work of CPPS is concentrated among member countries, however to carry out their main activities, Members are required to work with other developed and developing countries.
Current Considerations:
To coordinate and develop fishing policies of its Member countries giving more importance to fishing aspects such as:
* Rational use of, and application of, the principles of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries in fisheries legislation and regulations;
* Continuing assessment of fish stocks through direct and indirect methods; and
* Observance of the precautionary approach and investigation of its limits of reference.
Data Supply and Disclosure:
Members report on their performance in implementing management measures through documents or reports on the outcomes of meetings that have examined evaluation of fishery resources. CPPS is currently working on the organization of a databank in order to give better access to information.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:
There is no provision for dispute/conflict resolution, and there have been no disputes between Members.
Future Role:
Continuing support for the four Members and the satisfactory performance of technical and scientific institutions in the region.
PACIFIC COMMUNITY
Area of Competence
The territorial scope of the SPC was defined in the founding Canberra Agreement of 1947 as all those territories in the Pacific Ocean which are administered by the participating Governments and which lie wholly or in part south of the Equator and east from, and including, the Australian Territory of Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea, and Guam and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. There is no precise definition of this area by lines of longitude and latitude in the Agreement.
Terms of Reference
To encourage and strengthen international cooperation in promoting the economic and social welfare and advancement of the peoples of the South Pacific region.
SPC does not recommend any management measures to its Member Countries but does provide scientific advice on the status of exploited stocks. With regard to high seas fishing, its work includes:
* the collection and analysis of catch statistics and related data, and
* scientific research on tuna and billfish.
The SPC Convention requires that the Community limit its activities to technical matters. Therefore SPC does not focus on policy, legal and management aspects of fisheries. Rather, its activities are essentially scientific in nature. Thus, the fisheries interface between SPC and FFA involves the SPC undertaking scientific and technical assessments, frequently in close consultation with representatives from the distant water fishing nations that target tuna and tuna-like resources in the South Pacific.

Current Considerations
Under SPC auspices a series of standing committees have been established to consult on matters pertaining to stock status. These committees involve scientists and fisheries practitioners from member States and territories as well as scientists from distant water fishing nations.
The results of SPC stock assessments undertaken are taken into account by FFA member States when arriving at decisions on resource management.
The Eleventh Meeting of the Standing Committee on Tuna and Billfish Workshop on Precautionary Limit Reference Points for Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, was held in Honolulu, USA, 28-29 May 1998.
LATIN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERIES
Area of Competence
In accordance with Article 1 of the OLDEPESCA Articles of Agreement, OLDEPESCA was established by the Latin American Members of the Latin American Economic System and its geographical coverage extends to all of Latin America and the Caribbean.
Terms of Reference
The Constitutional Agreement of the Latin American Organization for Fishery Development, signed on 29 October 1982 and entering into force on 2nd November 1984 describes the principles and objectives of OLDEPESCA in Articles 3, 4 and 5.
Article 3 provides that the actions of OLDEPESCA shall be based on the principles of equality, sovereignty, independence of the States, solidarity, non-intervention in domestic affairs and respect for the different political, economic and social systems, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, unanimously approved at the General Assembly of the UN during its XXV Session, and respect for the sovereignty of States over their fishery resources.
The objectives of OLDEPESCA, as described in Article 4, are to meet Latin American food requirements adequately, making use of Latin American fishery resource potential for the benefit of Latin American peoples. To this end, the objectives of OLDEPESCA are, inter alia:
* to promote adequate utilization of fishery resources, preserving the marine and freshwater environment through the application of rational policies for the conservation of resources;
* to encourage and strengthen the Latin American cooperation in the development of the rational exploitation of sea and freshwater fishery resources, for the benefit of the peoples of the region;
* to increase substantially a food supply of sufficient nutritional value, the prices, preparation and presentation of which are in keeping with the needs of the low-income inhabitants of the region;
* to increase in the same manner, consumption of marine/freshwater products in the region; and
* to promote generation of jobs and improvement of incomes, through greater social and economic development of the communities related to the fishery activity of the region;
Article 5 provides that regional cooperation shall concentrate mainly on the following areas:
* research on fishery resources;
* exploitation of fishery resources, industrialization and physical support infrastructure;
* aquaculture;
* technological development;
* marketing;
* training; and
* international cooperation.
Current Membership
Bolivia Guatemala Panama
Costa Rica Guyana Peru
Ecuador Mexico Uruguay
El Salvador Nicaragua Venezuela
Participating Countries: Cuba Honduras
All members participate in the activities of the Organization. In accordance with Article 26 of the Articles of Agreement, the financial assets of OLDEPESCA consist of the initial contributions and annual dues of its Members and all the property and rights it may acquire, whether by purchase or by gift. The contribution of its Members shall be in accordance with the scheme of the Latin American Economic System as determined by the Conference of Ministers and may be changed in accordance with its needs.
Current Considerations
* the implementation of international fisheries instruments;
* aquaculture - including a regional project with the Inter-American Development Bank;
* social development;
* conservation of resources;
* trade and environment; and
* consultation and coordination on all issues to establish criteria and determine regional positions.
Data Supply and Disclosure
The Executive Board requests periodic reports from Member and Participating countries. In addition there are frequent visits and meetings, plus an annual Conference of Ministers. Restrictions on the dissemination of information are determined by the Conference of Ministers on the basis of subject matter and considerations of a political and institutional nature.
Conflict/Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
Article 38 of the Articles of Agreement provides that disputes relating to the application and interpretation of the Agreement which cannot be settled by the Members concerned, shall, at the request of any party to the conflict, be referred to the Conciliation Commission appointed for this purpose and comprising delegates of the member countries chosen by the parties to the dispute. Further, if the dispute cannot be resolved through the offices of the Conciliation Commission, resort shall be made to any means envisaged under International Law for the peaceful settlement of disputes until a solution acceptable to the parties has been found.
Having stated this provision, it should be noted that there has been no instance of dispute among the parties throughout the existence of OLDEPESCA.
Future Role
The new demands facing OLDEPESCA will require greater operational cohesion with more material and financial resources to engage in the process. It will be necessary to reinforce the regional mechanisms for fisheries coordination, and reinforcement will have to be accompanied by programming adjustments aimed at drawing maximum benefit from the international economic environment, particularly in terms of multilateral cooperation.
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION
Area of Competence
Based on the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the related Schedule of regulations, the IWC area of competence is all waters in which whaling is prosecuted.
Terms of Reference
To provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry.

Thirty-five members attended the IWC 50th Annual Meeting in Oman, May 1998. Four Contracting Governments (Costa Rica, Kenya, Peru, Senegal) have suffered long-term sanctions of loss of vote, and receive no documentation because of a failure to pay annual contributions. There are no specific incentives offered to encourage participation in the work of the IWC, however the United States of America has sometimes threatened trade sanctions under its domestic legislation to encourage whaling nations to join the IWC and obey its decisions.
Current Considerations
At the present time, catch limits for commercial whaling are set at zero. The IWC Scientific Committee has developed a conservation and precautionary approach Revised Management Procedure, in the event that commercial whaling resumes. The Scientific Committee is also carrying out assessments of the major whale stocks world-wide. The Commission itself is currently looking at relevant inspection, observation and monitoring issues.
Data Supply and Disclosure
The Convention requires reporting of catches and notification of infractions. Detailed statistics are required, as set out in the Schedule to the Convention. IWC has a large data base of primary records spanning the century, with greater detail from more recent years. There is some concern over the validity of the records supplied by Governments, especially in the light of major falsification of data by the former USSR.
Dispute/Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
There are no formal dispute/conflict resolution mechanisms. The practice is for disputes to be resolved by the majority vote of Commissioners.
Future Role
IWC currently has a major division between those nations who view whales as a renewable resource which can be sustainably harvested, and the current majority who are opposed to a resumption of commercial whaling even on a sustainable basis. Until this conflict is resolved, it is difficult to see a clear future role for the IWC.
CONCLUSION
RFBs play a significant role in expressing and developing the notion of regional cooperation. Since the emergence of the first modern RFBs, much has been learnt, and considerable experience has been gained, in the functioning and performance of such bodies. Despite such progress, many RFBs are slow to accommodate the challenges facing the international community of States in order that we conserve and manage the resource in a responsible manner.
While it is difficult to specify universal characteristics that make one fishery body more effective or less effective, than another, some general considerations relating to RFBs can be noted.
Incongruent Fisheries Interests of Contracting Parties
Within many RFBs there is a conflict of interest among Contracting Parties which leads to an inability to agree on the parameters necessary for management. For example, many RFBs contain both developed and developing States, coastal States, distant water fishing States, and coastal States with an interest in becoming more active high seas fishing States. For some Contracting Parties, fisheries constitutes a vital economic interest, while in others, fisheries constitutes a middle-level, or low, economic interest. Clearly, this diversity results in a varied commitment, participation and expectation regarding the objectives of the RFB. All States can potentially contribute, be it financially, intellectually, ideologically or politically, to the work of a RFB and it must be remembered that the diversity of Contracting Parties underpins the notion of cooperation. That is, that a group of States sharing only a common region, can cooperate together for the management of a resource.
Instead, the diversity of Contracting Parties too frequently becomes problematic when there is disagreement amongst members over scientific advice and/or management decisions of the body. This situation has created confusion and a near breakdown of management functions in some bodies. Potential problems are exacerbated by the many regional fisheries agreements that include objection procedures which allow States to exempt themselves from the obligations and requirements created by the body. Ideally, RFBs would adopt a new and improved decision making process that excludes the objection procedure and gives greater recognition to apolitical scientific analysis.
Management Focus
Funding difficulties prevent greater Contracting Party participation in RFB programmes and severely weaken the ability of secretariats to function effectively. In addition, according to the relevant mandates, many RFBs are empowered to only make advisory recommendations concerning management, and are consequently not able to regulate RFB Member States or their activities. Thus, even where there is no specific objection procedure, Contracting Parties may have the option of not implementing measures, particularly if their fleets are disadvantaged by management decisions. The high seas presents particular difficulties with regard to enforcing RFB decisions. Here, policing is the responsibility of each Member with respect to vessels flying its flag, and only the authorities of the licensing country may conduct prosecutions and impose penalties.
Political Will of Members
The effectiveness of RFBs is further undermined by the failure of member States to accept and/or implement international instruments central to the conservation and management of world marine fisheries. These instruments include the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the 1993Compliance Agreement. In addition greater recognition and promotion should be given to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.
Members States should further support their RFBs by providing them with complete and accurate data in a timely manner.
RFBs are not supra-national. They are only as strong and effective as their member States make them. Yet governments have proven slow to tackle the issues of fisheries reform for two reasons: First, benefits are slow to appear and do so only after considerable costs have been incurred for some time; and second, the individuals who incur the costs are seldom convinced that they will reap the benefits and so they resist what they perceive as a likely redistribution of their income. In a study on Regional Fishery Organizations as Vehicles for Good Fishery Governance, FAO has noted the individual and collective actions needed to be taken by States in order to strengthen regional fishery governance. The paper notes that it is necessary for States to:
* devolve the necessary powers transparently to these organizations or arrangements to enable them to undertake the functions for which they were established;
* adopt a proactive stance with respect to management and attempt to anticipate crises which may confront organizations or arrangements from to time;
* promote the full and equitable participation by members in organizations or arrangements, including greater participation in determining and funding work programmes, and greater participation in all inter-sessional activities;
* ensure that the organizations or arrangements have adequate financial and human resources to execute their mandates. Moreover, all members should be prepared to contribute financially to the work of organizations as this is considered as a pre-condition for institutional strengthening;
* periodically review the structures and mandates of organizations or arrangements so that they have the capacity to make effective management decisions and to enforce them.^ Depending on particular circumstances, this may involve a review of their legal and statutory requirements, procedural matters and institutional and capacity building measures;
* create new regional organizations or arrangements as a means of closing gaps in management areas. However, care should be exercised to avoid duplication;
* act in good faith recognizing that the regional governance needs might not always be precisely congruent with national aspirations and goals. In this connection it should be further recognized that many of the problems that confront regional organizations or arrangements arise from the non-compliance activities of members rather than from non-members. When such non compliance occurs there is often a reluctance on the part of the organization or arrangement to publicize the transgression for fear of creating embarrassment for the member concerned. However, the power of public disclosure should be recognized and used in support of improving regional governance;
* faithfully abide by decisions made by organizations or arrangements and be prepared to exercise effective flag State control in all situations;
* improve cooperation, via transparent manner, between organizations or arrangements, private sector interests and non-governmental organizations, so that real effect can be given to the need to broaden stakeholder participation;
* enhance coordination between organizations or arrangements, irrespective of whether they are FAO or non-FAO bodies or arrangements, and other economic groupings, as well as with relevant regional bodies responsible for environmental management;
* promote maritime boundary delimitation which is essential for fisheries management and resource allocation and as a means of resolving disputes; and
* recognize that developing countries face financial, human and technical constraints that can inhibit their capacity to meet their regional obligations fully.
States that are members of RFBs should view this criteria as a checklist for attention. By addressing these issues, States would demonstrate their political will to strengthen cooperation in regional fisheries management.
Chapter Four of this Report combines the legal framework data described in Chapter Two, and the RFB descriptions of this chapter, in an evaluation of the contemporary fishery management practices of RFBs. Specifically, those subjects which have been addressed in recent instruments, including, inter alia, the application of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, acceptance of the Compliance Agreement and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the measures raised in these instruments to specifically address contemporary fishery problems such as fleet capacity, fishing gear, use of VMS, and application of the precautionary approach, will be examined.

IV. REGIONAL FISHERY BODIE AND THE CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL REGIME FOR MARINE FISHERIES
THE STATE OF WORLD MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES
This chapter commences with a basic premise that world marine capture fisheries are in crisis from the point of view of sustainable utilization. The premise is supported by both the findings of FAO technical reports and by widespread general consensus in the writings of prominent publicists, including scientists, economists, international lawyers, and political scientists.
Some recent FAO observations may be noted below.
Both paragraph 7 of the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries and the 1994 FAO Fisheries Technical paper, "Review of the state of world marine fishery resources" have noted that some 70 percent of the world's marine capture fisheries were fully exploited, over-exploited or in a state of recovery. Moreover, the 1996 FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture demonstrates that the problems of overfishing, fishing capacity, and marine environmental degradation are continuing to worsen, rather than improve. In addition, the 1996 FAO Fisheries Technical Paper "Chronicles of Marine Fishery Landings (1950-1994)" emphasizes the "urgent need for effective measures to control and reduce fishing capacity and effort."
Concern over the state of world marine fisheries stems from the following considerations:
* the problem of overfishing - including the use of insufficiently selective fishing gear which leads to waste in the form of by-catch and discards;
* poor monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of vessels in both zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas - including the problem of reflagging and the need for better flag and port state controls; and
* environmental degradation of fish habitats.
To these issues could also be added the problem of the inadequate regime for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks under the 1982 Convention. This subject has, of course, been subsequently addressed by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, but that Agreement is still to come into effect.
The issues as well as the extent to which RFBs are actually addressing the issues are reviewed below.
Overfishing
The problem of overfishing is not new. The 1882 North Seas Fisheries Conference considered the subject of overfishing and the need to address conservation and protection of fisheries. This arose as a result of North Sea trawler fishers themselves complaining of impoverished stocks as early as 1878. In Britain, when the government failed to respond to fisher demands for action that would prevent overfishing, the large trawling companies came to an arrangement amongst themselves and voluntarily abstained from fishing those areas of the North Sea with great stock depletion. In 1890 the British National Sea Fisheries Protection Association held a conference to discuss overfishing and the need for fisheries conservation. The participants included governmental representatives from Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. The Parties agreed that the greatest handicap to resolving the problem of overfishing and implementing policies for the conservation of
stocks, was the lack of a universally accepted legal regime on the Law of the Sea.
The contemporary period not only has a legal regime on the Law of the Sea, but a host of other international instruments to reinforce the conservation and management of marine capture fisheries, yet overfishing continues to be a problem. This is made clear by the 1996 FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture which notes that overfishing:
"has become prevalent in most fishing areas and affects capture fisheries in developing and developed countries, often becoming particularly severe in densely populated coastal areas and in very productive offshore areas. Unless effective action is taken, overfishing will get worse."
In a paper which analyzes the global fishing fleet based on data from the Lloyds Maritime Information Services, Smith has examined the number of vessels in Flag States and concluded:
"The total fleet in the database shows a gradual rise from 1985 to a peak in 1991 and then for the first time a drop in 1993 and a further fall up to 1997. There also appears to be a tendency for the fleet in Europe, North America and Japan to decrease, in some cases dramatically like that of France. On the other hand, the fishing fleets of Latin American countries and the developing countries of Africa are still increasing."
Clearly, developing States are progressively becoming significant contributors to the international fishing fleet over-capacity problem. Garcia and Newton have estimated that developing State fishing capacity has increased from 28 percent to 58 percent of the world fleet component, prompted by high demand in local markets as well as in developed State markets. The result is that more than half of the top 20 producers in the world are developing States. In contrast, some developed States, including countries in Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand, have started programmes to control and reduce fishing fleets.
A more recent fleet analysis is offered by Fitzpatrick and Newton in their paper "Assessment of the World's Fishing Fleet 1991-1997". The authors observed that the size and capacity of the world's fishing fleets continued to increase over the period 1991-1996, followed by a slow down in new additions in 1995 and 1996. In 1997, the orders for new vessels show a return to construction of vessels with large tonnage. Further, throughout this period, additions to the world's fleet continue to exceed deletions. The authors conclude that there is evidence that the fishing fleets are not being restructured, that capacity is not being reduced, and that states with open registers are increasing their capacity.
It should be noted that there is difficulty in providing a cursory discussion on vessel numbers. The nature of the subject requires precise boundaries, and consequently data varies depending on the source (Lloyds Maritime Database, national ministries, and independent conservation organizations), or with basic materials such as whether to examine all fishing vessels, or vessels in excess of 24 metres, or vessels in excess of 100 Gross Tonnes (GT). Despite widespread general consensus that there is an overcapacity of fishing vessels, there is clearly a need for both a full and authoritative source of information, plus a standardized classification and measurement system. Fitzpatrick and Newton elaborate this point:
"There is no complete and authoritative record of fishing vessels in the world. Information has to be sought from a number of sources and it is time consuming to put the data into comparable form for estimating the size of the fleet. There is no standard measure for fishing vessels: Lloyds use GT as its classification for vessels 100 GT and over. The European Community uses length as its measure, 24m and over. Under the International Maritime Organization, the International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, Torremolinos, 1977 and its Protocol of 1993, a signatory would have to declare the numbers of fishing vessels of 24m in length or over that are authorized to fly its flag. Although these give a definition for the length of a fishing vessel, neither have entered into force. Many of the Asian fleets have fishing vessels which, by their configuration, are 24m or over, but are less than 100 GT."
Regarding the world fishing fleet capacity, performance is perhaps best measured in terms of landing rates. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper "Chronicles of Marine Fishery Landings" conducts a comprehensive analysis of world fisheries over the period 1950-1994 with particular attention to landings. The report shows a rapid increase in species diversity in reported national landings which demonstrates both the technological and geographical expansion of fisheries, as well as the increased value of some previously unspecified species on the market.
Aggregate landings of pelagic and demersal marine fish are found to be useful indicators of overall trends in world fisheries, once a few top species, (with a disproportionately higher share of the total variation) are excluded. As indicators, they show a continuous increase in the underlying trend in pelagic landings in contrast to demersal fish which have remained level since the early 1970s. Landings from distant waters increased exponentially in the 1960s, but fell abruptly in 1973 with a drop in Alaska pollock catches. Further development was curtailed by an increase in the number of States which claimed extended zones of national jurisdiction. Distant water fishery landings declined dramatically in the 1990s with the collapse of State-owned fleets from Eastern Europe. Landings of straddling stocks have declined since the later 1980s, but landings of valuable highly migratory species continue to increase.
An analysis of such landing statistics, (in which the relative rate of increase in landings during the developing and mature phases is used to estimate when the rate falls to zero, and the corresponding potential landings) has been recorded by both the FAO "Chronicles of Marine Fishery Landings", and by Garcia and Newton. The data shows that the annual relative rate of increase of world reported landings had significantly decreased since 1950, which indicates that the maximum production from the world's conventional marine resources under current exploitation regimes was being approached, and that the mean catches of recent years were probably close to that potential.
The overall picture which emerges from both the FAO Chronicles of Marine Fishery Landings, and the Garcia and Newton analysis, is that the world fishery is operating close to maximum production and that there is an urgent need for effective measures to control and reduce fishing capacity and effort.
The problem of overfishing is further compounded by poor fishing practices which result in by-catch and discards. By-catch is taken to mean all species captured other than the target species. Discards may include a small to significant fraction of the captured target species which is normally undersized, together with non-target species. The problem is succinctly explained by the 1996 FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture:
"Most [fishers] at most times catch more types of fish, and sometimes fish of smaller size, than they aim to. The unintended catch is usually referred to as the "by-catch". Some of the by-catch is useful and is kept; the rest is discarded which usually means returned [dead] to the sea."
If by-catch consists of a small proportion of mature specimens from healthy stocks, there is relatively little damage. The problem is that too frequently, by-catch consists of juveniles of commercial species, so that if large numbers are caught, it is likely to reduce the numbers of mature fish.
The 1991 FAO paper "Fish for Food and Development" reported that almost 20 percent of the world fish production was lost as a result of spoilage and poor handling or discarded as waste or trash fish. Since this time, more extensive investigations and analysis have shown that the problem of by-catch and discards is more serious than described in 1991. There is a world total level of by-catch and discards ranging from 19.9 to 39.5 million tonnes, with an estimated mean of 27 million tonnes. Using this mean figure, the 1994 percentage of by-catch and discards would have been 32 percent of reported total production in marine capture fisheries.
The result of this practice is that fishery managers are increasingly applying closed seasons in certain zones where juveniles may be numerous. Another strategy to address the problem is the increase in activity to develop more selective gears and techniques. There is also substantial international support for prohibiting the discarding of fish at sea as a means of facilitating more selective fishing and reducing waste. Doulman notes that Iceland, New Zealand and Norway already have policies in place to prohibit or limit discarding part of the catch at sea, (for example by making it mandatory to bring all fish ashore) and it is expected that there will be pressure for other countries to follow suite.
Inadequate Monitoring, Control and Surveillance of Fleets
The international legal regime for fisheries can only operate successfully if there is effective MCS of vessels at the national, and desirably, regional, level. In April 1981, FAO's Fisheries Department convened an Expert Consultation on Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Systems for Fisheries Management which adopted the following definitions.
* Monitoring - the continuous requirement for the measurement of fishing effort characteristics and resource yields;
* Control - the regulatory conditions under which the exploitation of the resource may be conducted; and
* Surveillance - the degree and types of observations required to maintain compliance with the regulatory controls imposed on fishing activities.
The purpose of MCS, according to Doulman is for countries to:
* enforce sovereign rights over fisheries resources under their national jurisdiction (i.e. to prevent unauthorized exploitation by citizens and/or foreigners), and
* to ensure that information necessary for the development of fisheries management programmes is collected and that such programmes are implemented and observed.
To regulate a fishery, States may consider a variety of possibilities, including, inter alia: limited entry by licensing, restricting fishing vessels or gear, area closures, time (seasonal) closures, area zoning, global non-allocated catch quotas, allocated catch quotas, taxes or fees based on fishing catch or effort, and minimum size restrictions. Such programmes require some measure of MCS.
The FAO Fisheries Management and Law Advisory Programme Regional Workshop on Fisheries Monitoring, Control and Surveillance held in Mauritius, 16-20 December 1996 presented a number of papers which demonstrated the importance of surveillance efficiency. In particular, the Report of Working Group 2, dealing with Financial and Economic Considerations noted:
"Surveillance provides benefits both in terms of increasing the fisher's perception of the probability of being caught operating illegally, and also can bring in additional revenue in the form of paid fines. The Working Group agreed that the key to surveillance efficiency was the optimal combined use of a variety of facilities, including VMS [vessel monitoring systems], aircraft, FPVs [fishery patrol vessels], coastal radar and other methods. For example, relatively inexpensive VMS and coast watch systems have proved to be extremely useful in focusing and directing more expensive forms of surveillance, such as aircraft and FPVs for the collection of evidence. Licensed fisher's can be an important source of information on illegal fishing activity. Information can also be provided formally or informally through various non-fishery sources, such as domestic airline flights."
Inappropriate and ineffective MCS programmes have led to poor implementation of fisheries conservation and management arrangements. Recent attempts to improve MCS have led to a number of States and RFBs adopting widespread or compulsory use of VMS. This is in keeping with both the spirit of the Code of Conduct and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement.
The application of VMS to remote fishing operations on the high seas, particularly where targeted stocks are widely dispersed, is logical. Furthermore, satellite systems have proven to be a cheaper and better option than the currently available synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and infrared systems. In a paper presented at the 1996 Workshop on MCS in Mauritius, Lodge writes:
"VMS provides simultaneous near-real-time position monitoring of all vessels fitted with transponders. This information is usually sufficient, at least to enable the fishery manager to target conventional air and surface surveillance assets more effectively. More sophisticated options include the ability to use VMS for catch reporting and communications purposes. Capital costs are much lower than the cost of a surface patrol vessel or aircraft, and most of the recurrent costs involved in VMS can be passed onto the fishing vessel operators through increased license fees."
A significant part of effective MCS is that aspect of fisheries management that looks to flag State control over fishing vessels. For a State to have effective flag State control, it must ensure, through its domestic legislation and policy that its vessels which are authorized to fish on the high seas comply with all fishery conservation and management programmes to which the State has nationally, regionally or globally adhered to. Thus where a vessel contravenes such conservation and management programmes, it is the responsibility of the flag State to take action that will deter and prevent any further violations. The importance of improved flag State responsibility is demonstrated by the attention given to the subject in the Code of Conduct, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the Compliance Agreement.
Similarly, unauthorized fishing by vessels in zones of national jurisdiction undermines coastal State conservation and management measures and must ultimately be the responsibility of the vessel's flag State. This is recognized in United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 49/116 of 1994 and subsequent resolutions.
One of the most significant contemporary problems in the international legal regime for marine capture fisheries concerns the practice of vessels reflagging. National and international fishery management regimes are often based on the registered nationality of fishing vessels. Consequently, the registry is sometimes manipulated by vessels seeking registration in a more "convenient" flag state, (hence the expression "flag of convenience"). Recognition of this problem by FAO led to the initial work to develop the Compliance Agreement. It was for this reason that the Agreement was more commonly known, while it was being negotiated as the "Flagging Agreement".
Writing in 1994, William Burke noted that NAFO had experienced reflagging problems when flag states had accepted restrictions pursuant to decisions of NAFO, and vessels responded by reflagging in order to avoid such restrictions. Today, some RFBs, most particularly CCAMLR face their greatest challenge yet in attempting to monitor and survey the activities of reflagged fishing vessels within the vast region that comprises the Convention Area. For bodies such as CCAMLR, the reflagging of vessels constitutes a two fold problem. This is that whilst it is almost impossible to exercise monitoring, control and surveillance of such vessels operating within the Convention Area, the fact that such vessels exist, and require MCS, makes it almost impossible to exercise effective MCS on authorized vessels, such as monitoring of catches and compliance with regional treaties.
As mentioned above, the issue of reflagging of vessels was specifically addressed by the Compliance Agreement, and that Agreement is yet to come into effect. A consequence of this gap in the law is the increasing popularity of reflagging. Smith has observed:
"A new trend in 1997 is the current increase in reflagging. During 1994-1997 over 2,000 vessels reflagged (nearly 10% of the fleet.)"
The Compliance Agreement addresses the problem of reflagging by, inter alia, providing in Article VI for FAO to maintain an international record of vessels authorized by flag States to operate on the high seas. This information would be circulated on request to any global, regional or subregional fishery organization in order to note which vessels operate in their areas of jurisdiction. Fitzpatrick and Newton note that a further remedy would be for States whose vessels are flagging out, to legislate so that registered national fishing vessels cannot leave their jurisdiction, and any requests for deletion from the flag State registry will be denied. This would prevent the transfer of used vessels to flag of convenience States, but also the "legitimate" sale of used vessels to developing States which may have different standards on profitability. It also does not solve the problem of new vessels where flag of convenience States will flag on delivery.
Along with the need for increased flag State control, there is a reciprocal need for improved port State controls and the subject is addressed by Article V of the Compliance Agreement, Article 8 of the Code of Conduct, and Article 23 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. Effective Port State control of fishing vessels assists in the enforcement of fisheries conservation and management, and is particularly important when flag State control is weak, or when fishing vessels are widely dispersed geographically, or when vessels do not return to their flag State for several years at a time, if at all.
Environmental Degradation of Fish Habitats
The 1996 FAO "State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture" lists environmental degradation of catchment and coastal areas as one of the critical management issues connected with sustainable fisheries.
In both developed and developing States, much of the waste that is run-off from industrial, urban and agricultural activity, ends up, via waterways and sewers, in the coastal zone, a region with some of the highest rates of biological productivity and the richest fishing grounds in the world.
An estimated 80-90 percent of the global commercial fish catch is caught within 320 kilometres of shore, predominantly in the coastal benthic and coastal pelagic regions, including coral reefs, continental shelves, and those fertile regions where upwelling cold waters meet surface waters. These ecosystems are highly susceptible to environmental degradation from human land-based activities. In recent years, habitat destruction has been particularly problematic as a result of increased human land activity including channelization, drainage, filling and water diversion, eutrophication (where excessive levels of nutrients build up and essentially suffocate the marine environment) and toxic pollution. These problems limit species diversity and reduce ecosystem stability. Platt McGinn provides an example of agricultural run-off in the Mississippi River Basin leading to a biological dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico which is about twice the size of Puerto Rico. Further, on the
question of mitigation, or whether the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems can be reduced by efforts to restore them, the scientific verdict is still uncertain. As Thorne-Miller and Catena have noted:
"Once damage has been done, simply stopping the offending activities may not be enough to bring the system back to its original state."
The health of such areas is likely to worsen when it is recalled that 40 percent of the world's population live within 100 kilometres of a coastline, and that within the next 30 years, coastal populations are predicted to increase from 2.5 billion people to 6.3 billion people. It should also be recognized that living marine resources make a substantial contribution to global food security and, as the world's population increases, it will be necessary to increase, not damage, food production from all sources.
Other problems of environmental degradation concern the fishing practices of fishers themselves. Apart from the wastefulness of by-catch and discards (discussed above), environmental degradation occurs as a result of large-scale dredging, continued use of large scale pelagic drift nets, and cyanide poisoning which all damage habitats, reduce smaller fish cover from predators, deplete fish food supplies and lower local biological diversity.
Apart from degradation of the oceanic environment, human induced abuse of the planet is leading to increasingly evident climate change. The Earth Summit plus Five special session of the United Nations General Assembly to Review and Appraise the Implementation of Agenda 21 noted that global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to rise. Furthermore, a 1995 report by a UN panel of scientists stated that the balance of evidence suggests a "discernible human influence on the global climate. The impact of climate change on world marine capture fisheries is still uncertain. However, it is clear that fish are particularly vulnerable due to their inability to regulate their internal temperature. In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, at the direction of the United Nations General Assembly, established an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Referring to the IPCC 1995 Report of Working Group
II (on impacts of climate change), Platt McGinn notes:
"If current predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prove correct, in the next 50-100 years climate change could have a greater impact on the health of world fisheries than overfishing itself. Climate change will likely exacerbate the effects of pollution, habitat degradation, and ultraviolet radiation. Expected rises in sea level may effectively drown estuaries, thus destroying habitats for fish and their prey. Some fish species may migrate toward the cooler polar areas in response to rising sea temperatures at lower latitudes, while others will grow faster in warmer water, and outcompete other species."
The problem of climate change requires action by the international community, and in a legal sense, this has been achieved by the International Convention on Climate Change. It now remains for States to have the political will to enact its provisions.
Many of the above mentioned environmental issues were recognized by FAO in the 1993 publication, "Implementation of the Strategy adopted by the FAO World Conference on Fisheries Management and Development". Paragraph 14 notes:
"Considerable and increasing attention is now being given by governments and the world community as a whole to environmental concerns and to the need for sustainable development. In the fisheries sector, sustainable development implies not only the better management and utilization of aquatic resources but also harmonization with the aquatic environment and ecosystems. Industrial, urban and agricultural development of land, waters and shallow coastal areas poses increasing risks to the maintenance of environmental quality and biological diversity. At the same time, unsound practices in capture fisheries and in aquaculture endanger the environment and the sustainable use of aquatic resources. Concerns are also being expressed regarding the as-yet unclear implications of global climatic changes for fisheries. More careful balancing of short-term social, political and economic considerations with longer-term needs and objectives is essential to ensure the sustainability of
the productive capacity of the aquatic environment."
SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES
To the extent that the law, as opposed to education, science, economics or politics, can provide solutions to the problems facing world marine capture fisheries, significant progress has been made to address the broad problems of overfishing, inadequate MCS, and environmental degradation described above.
An international legal regime for fisheries has been described in Articles 55-75, 87, and 116-120 of the 1982 Convention. These provisions have been elaborated, extended and modernized by subsequent international legal instruments, many of which still await State acceptance or ratification in order to come into effect. The achievements of these contemporary international fishery instruments are worth noting.
From the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the key documents of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development provide respectively for a comprehensive plan for global action in all areas of sustainable development, and a series of principles defining the rights and responsibilities of States. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 recognize the need to protect the oceans, seas, coastal areas, and the rational use and development of marine living resources. It notes the problems of "unregulated fishing, overcapitalization, excessive fleet size, vessels reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable data bases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States." On the subject of marine environmental degradation, the Earth Summit noted that about 80 percent of marine pollution is caused by land based activities. As a consequence of this, an international agreement to combat land-based sources of marine
pollution was adopted in 1995, and negotiations have begun for a treaty to control persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin. States are further urged to pursue the protection and sustainable development of marine resources with new "integrated, precautionary and anticipatory approaches."
Such references to the precautionary approach in fisheries development, and the inclusion of the precautionary approach as Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration, were a response to the 1990 UN Secretary General's Report on the Law of the Sea which expressly recognized the "considerable significance of the precautionary approach for future approaches to marine environmental protection and resource conservation." Since this time, the precautionary approach has been included in nearly every new environmental treaty.
As mentioned above, the scope of the precautionary approach is controversial, undoubtedly because, as Freestone notes:
"At its strongest it can be used to reverse the traditional burden of proof, so that in cases of scientific uncertainty as to possible effects of particular activities, the burden of proof is passed to the potential polluter, who needs to prove that his, or her, activities will not damage the environment. In this sense it finds its manifestation as a legal burden of proof rule."
A further consequence of the Rio Earth Summit was the establishment of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) which monitors and guides the implementation of Agenda 21 and other Rio commitments.
Finally, it might be noted that two international legal agreements were opened for signature in Rio de Janeiro, and have subsequently entered into force:
* United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, and
* United Nations Convention on Climate Change,
The former Convention on Biological Diversity has been ratified by 161 States, and obligates Governments to protect plant and animal species through habitat preservation and other means. However, national action on habitat preservation is still too insufficient to counter the continuing environmental degradation from unregulated development and pollution. This problem was addressed by the 1997 Earth Summit +5 Special Session of the General Assembly to Review and Appraise the Implementation of Agenda 21. Here, Governments agreed to continue efforts to implement the biodiversity treaty and to complete a protocol on biosafety.
The United Nations Convention on Climate Change, signed in Rio de Janeiro, has been ratified by 166 States, and obligates States to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000. The 1997 Kyoto Conference on Climate Change endorsed a 15 percent reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2010, while the Alliance of Small Island States, whose very existence is threatened by global warming, called for a 20 percent reduction below 1990 levels by 2005.
The Earth Summit's call for an intergovernmental conference under United Nations auspices to deal with the inadequate legal regime for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks led to the negotiation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. The Agreement makes provision to address, inter alia, the problems of overfishing; inadequate MCS; and environmental degradation. These are reviewed below.
First, the subject of overfishing is identified as a particular problem in the Preamble to the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and is further mentioned in Article 5(h) which requires both coastal States and States fishing on the high seas to take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity.
Further, by Article 5(f), States are required to minimize pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, and catch of non-target species.
On the subject of environmental degradation, States are required to protect biodiversity in the marine environment, and apply the precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. In fact, Article 6 is solely concerned with describing a comprehensive regime on how this can best be done.
Undoubtedly the most significant achievement of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement in addressing the contemporary problems of marine capture fisheries, is in the legal regime provided for MCS. The provisions include a specific requirement for States to implement and enforce conservation and management measures through effective monitoring, control and surveillance. The regime to achieve improved MCS is described in other provisions which include better collection and provision of information and cooperation in scientific research, more wide-ranging duties and powers of the flag and port States, and specific attention being given to enforcement of global, regional and sub-regional law and policy. It should be recalled that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement will come into effect as binding on the parties thereto, when a further 12 States have deposited instruments of ratification or accession.
The Compliance Agreement is particularly concerned to address the overfishing and MCS problems presented by reflagged fishing vessels operating under flags of convenience as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules. As with the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Compliance Agreement is still waiting to come into effect, requiring another 14 States to deposit instruments of acceptance with FAO.
The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries proposes voluntary actions for fundamental changes to marine capture fisheries and aquaculture. To specifically address the problems of overfishing, inadequate MCS, and environmental degradation, the Code outlines General Principles for responsible conservation of fisheries resources and fisheries management and development. These include:
* preventing overfishing and excess fishing capacity and rehabilitating fish population;
* applying a precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources;
* developing and applying selectively and environmentally safe fishing gear and practices;
* protecting and rehabilitating critical fishery habitats in marine and freshwater ecosystems;
* monitoring and controlling the activities of fishing vessels and fishing support vessels; and
* more effective flag and port state controls.
The Code, the Compliance Agreement and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement all seek to strengthen the role of RFBs in the governance of marine capture fisheries.
The problem of excess fishing capacity and the need to control fishing effort, inadequate MCS and environmental degradation have been further addressed at the international level by the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, the 1995 Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security, the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 49/118 of 1994, and 50/25 of 1995, the 1996 Resolution on fishery matters adopted by the 95th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (Istanbul), and the 1996 Draft Report of the ad hoc Intersessional Working Group on Sectoral Issues of the Commission on Sustainable Development. It should also be noted that once again, these international initiatives have reiterated the need to strengthen regional and subregional fishery bodies and arrangements.
At the national level, some States, (particularly Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the European Community, Iceland, Japan, Malaysia, Namibia, New Zealand, Norway and the United States) are taking action to reduce fleet capacity and to improve fisheries management. Their efforts have been directed towards effort quotas, individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and limiting entry into fisheries. The FAO 1996 "State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture" notes that this has the effect of converting a publicly owned and used resource into a publicly owned but privately used resource. Platt McGinn has observed that a consequence of the initial New Zealand ITQ program was that within one year of its establishment, the three largest fishing companies held title to 43 percent of the ITQs. Thus many small vessel owners and fishers subcontracted to larger companies, or went out of business. This was not an intended effect of the new policy. A better publicly owned but privately used
system, can be seen in the Alaskan example of Community Development Quotas (CDQs) for community based, small scale fishers. In Alaska, New Zealand and other States, policy makers have now set limits to prevent monopolies from forming.
Another significant development has occurred in those States which have implemented buy-back schemes for vessels, which when combined with a moratorium on the entry of new vessels into a fishery, significantly reduce the build-up of fishing capacity. Clearly such programs present difficulties for developing States, particularly those with numerous subsistent and small-scale commercial fisheries. FAO reports have noted:
"Among the problems to resolve in some of these fisheries are the relocation and redeployment of fisher[s] who would be displaced as a consequence of limited entry policies. It must be recognized, however, that the failure to limit entry in overexploited artisanal and small-scale fisheries will only destruct these fisheries further and contribute to the long-term impoverishment of communities dependent on them for their livelihoods."
To meet the threats facing environmental degradation of coastal and marine areas, several international initiatives have been taken. The Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) was established to advise solely on marine pollution issues, but its terms of reference have been broadened to enable it to respond more fully on all aspects of marine environmental protection and management. Other support programs are offered by the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the World Conservation Union. There have been numerous national government initiatives to institute some form of coastal management, however relatively few countries have a nation-wide and effective strategy for dealing with coastal and marine environmental degradation and resource competition.
Regarding environmental damage from fishers themselves, most States are aware of the problems, and have made attempts to solve them. The fact is that where harmful fishing practices persist, they often reflect difficulties in enforcement and fisher reluctance to change.
The precautionary approach to fisheries management is being progressively implemented in some countries (e.g. Australia and the United States of America). Other developed States have research and monitoring programmes related to the marine environment, including research oriented towards climatic variations, whilst other States are carrying out research on the effects of ultraviolet radiation (including vulnerability assessments) on the marine environment. The 1996 FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture notes that much of the above research is relatively costly, and consequently developing States are not as active as their developed counterparts. Nevertheless,
"many developing countries have established national science policies oriented towards the marine environment and are actively involved in coastal zone research, observations and assessments. Many developing countries strongly support the development of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), although their participation is limited."
The extent to which RFBs are currently addressing the issues raised above, is the subject of the final part of this chapter.
ATTEMPTS BY REGIONAL FISHERY BODIES TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WORLD MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES
The 1996 "State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture" notes:
"Many existing subregional and regional bodies are not as effective as intended. The difficulties they encounter in implementing conservation and management measures is often reflected in the poor state of the resources they are set to manage."
If the state of marine capture fishery resources is to improve, and if conservation and management measures are to succeed, it is necessary to address the problems of overfishing; inadequate monitoring, control and surveillance; and environmental degradation at both State and RFB levels. There are a succession of international agreements and other instruments post-dating the 1982 Convention to address these issues. This section examines the degree to which RFBs are attempting or achieving compliance with such instruments.
NORTH ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION
Use of the precautionary approach
As a response to the adoption of the precautionary approach in numerous international agreements, the Council has considered the possible use of the approach in the work of NASCO.
The 1995-97 Report on the Activities of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization notes:
"The anadromous life-cycle of the Atlantic salmon means that it is exposed to a wide range of pressures both in the marine and freshwater environments and the genetic structure and small size of many salmon populations mean that the resource is particularly vulnerable. Many of the pressures on it are poorly understood, but their effects may be irreversible. In these circumstances, adoption of a precautionary approach would seem to be appropriate."
Bearing this in mind, the Council has established a Working Group to advise, inter alia, on the application of the precautionary approach to the management of North Atlantic salmon fisheries, the formulation of management advice and associated scientific research; and the introductions, transfers and impacts of transgenic fish. The Working Group reported back to the Council at its Fifteenth Annual Meeting in 1998, when a Special Session on the Precautionary Approach was held. NASCO and its Contracting Parties have agreed to adopt and apply a precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of Atlantic salmon in order to protect the resource and preserve the environments in which it lives. A Draft Action Plan is being developed on the application of the precautionary approach to the Organization's work. This is anticipated to represent a major change in the way Atlantic Salmon is managed. It has been further agreed that the next step for NASCO and its
Contracting Parties to address is the application of the precautionary approach to freshwater habitat issues and the by-catch of salmon in other fisheries.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Compliance Agreement
In 1989-90 NASCO became aware that a number of vessels had re-flagged to Non-Contracting Parties so as to avoid the provisions of the Convention, and were fishing for salmon in international waters north of the Faeroe Islands. Diplomatic Action was taken and a Protocol Open for Signature by States not Parties to the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean was adopted. There have been no sightings since February, 1994. NASCO are looking at ways to improve methods of surveillance in the area. With regard to illegal fishing, NASCO is looking at methods to reduce the level of unreported catches. The Organization is unaware of any unauthorized fishing for salmon in zones of national jurisdiction.
NASCO has not given any specific consideration, endorsement or promotion to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, however, aspects of the Code are complimentary to measures developed by NASCO in relation to aquaculture development, re-flagging and the precautionary approach.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
NASCO has noted that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement does not apply to salmon although the Agreement contains provisions which can contribute to the international conservation and management of North Atlantic salmon. Under the Convention, fishing for salmon is prohibited in most areas beyond 12 nautical miles. NASCO is unaware of any recent reports of fishing for salmon in international waters by non-Contracting Parties.
INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC HALIBUT COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach
The framework for determining yield recommendations established by the Commission adheres to the provisions of the precautionary approach. Specifically, IPHC have established a target harvest rate (used to compute the constant exploitation yield (CEY) that results in adequate long-term yields across a wide range of population dynamic models consistent with historical experience. In addition, the Commission has used the minimum observed historical biomass as a limit reference point, even though historical estimates show no evidence of a decrease in recruitment when that level was attained (twice) in the past. In other words, the minimum historical biomass is not equated with an overfishing threshold.
Furthermore, improvements to IPHC simulations are required and are underway. In particular, changes in growth associated with different productivity regimes are being incorporated into the yield estimations. Improved measures of reproductive output, and of the effect of fishing on each sex would be possible if IPHC would be able to estimate the sex ratio of the catch. Estimation of the sex ratio of historical catches from otolith characteristics is in progress and will be used in reconstructions of historical trends in spawning biomass. In addition to better characterizing the halibut dynamics in the simulations, IPHC need to characterize better the uncertainty in the estimates of biomass, which affects quotas directly. The Commission is currently developing simulation models for testing their stock assessment procedure, which will result in more realistic measures of uncertainty than can be computed at the present time.
IPHC have also initiated a Fisheries Oceanography programme that addresses, in part, the specifications of the precautionary approach that concern dynamics of associated resources. Knowledge of ecosystem-wide dynamics could be a key component of understanding and predicting halibut dynamics, and in producing realistic simulations to evaluate a target reference point.
The element of the precautionary approach that is not specifically implemented is the development of harvest rules for directing fishing mortality or stock biomass to the appropriate levels when departures occur. In the current IPHC harvesting strategy, this would amount to specifying in advance how the harvest rate should be adjusted when there is a high probability that the stock will drop below the minimum historical biomass. This process is currently implemented through periodic re-evaluation and adjustments of the target harvest rate, but there is no pre-defined procedure for incremental adjustments in response to estimates of current stock biomass or short-term forecasts of biomass trends. At present, IPHC have not yet determined whether halibut dynamics are sufficiently well understood to implement a clockwork-type of incremental change, or whether the present approach of periodic assessment and reappraisal is more sensitive to management needs.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Compliance Agreement:
IPHC has no reported problems with reflagged fishing vessels, and all relevant States to, and operating in, the area, are members of the Commission. Regarding the specific provisions of the Code, the Commission has not endorsed or promoted the provisions in any express manner. However, through its research on, and promotion of, fishing methodologies to minimize discard mortality of halibut and other species, and its procedures for yield determination, the Commission has effectively implemented provisions of the Code.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
Provisions within the Agreement which place an onus for regional or subregional conservation and management upon RFBs, are in part adhered to by the two Contracting Parties in their annual reporting and research results.
GENERAL FISHERIES COMMISSION FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Compliance Agreement
The GFCM Report of the Twenty-Second Session held in Rome from 13-16 October 1997, provides in paragraphs 34-39 the measures taken by the Commission to implement the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. It was agreed by the Commission that the members should report the steps taken, and results achieved, in implementing the Code at each Session.
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES ORGANIZATION
Use of the precautionary approach:
For the NAFO Scientific Council Meeting of June 1997, a Report of the Ad hoc Working Group of the NAFO Scientific Council on the precautionary approach was prepared as NAFO SCS Doc. 97/12. The Report, titled "Precautionary Approach to Fisheries Management" recognized the importance of the precautionary approach in both the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. After reviewing the development and application of the precautionary approach to fisheries management, the NAFO Scientific Council endorsed the approach. In addition, the Council intends to use the practical guidance given in FAO 1995 Guidelines on the Precautionary Approach to Capture Fisheries and Species Introductions. The Council recognized that implementation of the precautionary approach would be a challenging and ongoing process, and subsequently a framework and action plan were developed.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
The NAFO General Council and Fisheries Commission has been discussing aspects of implementation of the Code and the Fish Stocks Agreement. In particular, there has been substantive discussion on the transparency of the NAFO decision making process and participation of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations, and the implementation of the precautionary approach to NAFO managed stocks. Contracting Parties have met in several working groups, and there is an on-going process of negotiation in the NAFO community with good prospects for a successful resolution. NAFO notes:
"It should be emphasized that the precautionary approach is a very complex scientific and managerial problem, and therefore very careful and steady intelligent process would be required from all Parties to develop and implement such a sophisticated tool for stock management/exploitation around the world."
Regarding the problems of by-catch and discards, regulatory measures are engraved in the NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures. There are provisions which constitute a legal basis and guidelines for the NAFO inspectors and observers to enforce these provisions. Observers on board fishing vessels monitor all by-catch and discards, and provide their reports to the NAFO Secretariat.
Compliance Agreement
There are no reports of unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction. For high seas fishing, the General Council of NAFO has been working on the problem of non-Contracting Party fishing activity in the NAFO Regulatory Area and deployed the following actions:
* Adopted the "Scheme to Promote Compliance by Non-Contracting Party vessels with the Conservation and Enforcement Measures Established by NAFO." The Scheme would be directed at Non-Contracting Party vessels engaged in fishing activities in the NAFO Regulatory Area. The scheme presumes that a Non-Contracting Party vessel which has been sighted engaging in fishing activity in the NAFO Regulatory Area is undermining the NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures.
* If such sighted vessels enter the ports of Contracting Parties, they must be inspected. No landings or transshipments will be permitted in Contracting Party ports unless such vessels can establish that certain species on board were not caught in the NAFO Regulatory Area, and for certain other species, that the vessel applied the NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures, and
* Contracting Parties must report the results of inspections to NAFO and all Contracting Parties.
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
As an organization concerned with providing scientific advice, ICES is most concerned with those provisions of the Code that deal with the subjects of by-catch and discards. The Council has commenced large scale sampling programs, and data is currently becoming available for research and analysis. This data will eventually be included in future models.
The use of the precautionary approach:
ICES Document CM 1997/Assess:7 is a Report of the Study Group on the Precautionary Approach to Fisheries Management, the Study Group having met at ICES Headquarters from 5-11 February 1997. The Report recognized the need to utilize the precautionary approach, as it is recognized in numerous international agreements, as well as providing a description of the approach. The Report also gives attention to the distinction between precautionary approach and precautionary principle, as well as noting that the implications for ICES are at both the technical and advisory levels. ICES is currently working on implementing the precautionary approach into their advice.
NORTH PACIFIC MARINE SCIENCE ORGANIZATION
As the provision of fisheries advice, and specific consideration of questions relating to marine science, have not yet developed within PICES, there is neither a direct application of the precautionary approach, nor implementation of the recent legal conventions and instruments. Through PICES programs, such as the 1998 CCCC Monitor Task Team Workshop on the effects of climate variations on the marine ecosystems of the Subarctic North Pacific, PICES investigates and addresses the problems of environmental degradation.
FISHERY COMMITTEE FOR THE EASTERN CENTRAL ATLANTIC, COMITE REGIONAL DES PECHES DU GOLFE DE GUINEE AND THE COMMISSION SOUS-REGIONALE DES PECHES
Although these bodies have not specifically acted to address the post 1982 Convention, the Member Countries of the three RFBs met in June, 1998 at the Regional Workshop on the Adaptation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries in West Africa. The results are briefly described below:
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
Participants endorsed the importance of the Code, and noted that effective implementation of the Code was essential for sustainable resource use. The workshop also recognized the importance of regional and inter-regional collaboration through the work of RFBs and arrangements. The Working Group on Fishing Operations noted that the marine fisheries of the West Africa region are dominated by the artisanal sector, and that where appropriate, national fishery authorities should complete or develop the regulation of artisanal and small scale fisheries. When this adjustment occurs, effort should be made to conform with the principles and norms of the Code. Where regulations already exists, action should be taken to strengthen them in respect of the Code. Finally, it should be noted that the implementation of the Code will in certain cases induce expenses for private operators, and therefore, some time should be allowed before enforcement of the regulations. The Plan of Action
proposed by the Working Group was to:
* Request individual States to organize national workshops and seminars to inform stakeholders of the Code of Conduct;
* Request FAO to assist in the compilation of the existing document regarding all the texts referred to in the Code of Conduct and when appropriate to complete existing technical guidelines in regard to specific aspects of artisanal fisheries; and
* Request FAO to organize short-term training sessions of trainers on the Code of Conduct.
The final Resolution produced at the workshop by 21 countries and four intergovernmental organizations noted that the implementation of the Code is the responsibility of the respective States, but nevertheless requested FAO to undertake all necessary steps to provide assistance to the States of the West Africa region in the implementation of the Code. This assistance would ensure that, after the adoption and adaptation of the Code by the countries of West Africa, the lack of information and expertise would not be a constraint to the willingness of the States to effect urgent and indispensable adjustments in the fisheries sector.
The Compliance Agreement and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
Paragraph 3 of the Resolution of the Regional Workshop on the Adaptation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries in West Africa, Cotonou, Benin, 1-5 June 1998, provides:
"Conscious of the important role that the implementation of the 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement will play in the management of high seas fish stocks, the participants urge governments in the region to consider accepting these instruments as soon as possible."
WESTERN CENTRAL ATLANTIC FISHERY COMMISSION
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries:
The Meeting of the Technical Committee of the Twenty-Fifth FAO Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean, 16-18 June 1998, considered the implementation of the Code of Conduct in the region. The Committee highlighted the importance of applying the Code to achieve the conservation of resources and the sustainability of fisheries, food security and social and economic development. The Committee called upon the Governments to introduce the Code in their laws and/or make the necessary institutional and policy changes needed to put it into practice in accordance with national and subregional requirements. The Committee asked that FAO continue to provide technical cooperation and support in identifying funding for implementation of the Code at country level. The Committee recognized the importance of the Fishery Commission for the Western Central Atlantic (WECAFC) for regional cooperation in the management and conservation of fishery resources and as an instrument
for application of the Code in the Region. The next meeting of the Committee, to be held in Venezuela, would examine implementation of the Code at regional level.
On the specific subject of fisheries by-catch and discards, States that have shrimp trawl fisheries (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Mexico, Suriname, Venezuela) are now landing more by-catch for human consumption than in the past. This is partly due to an increasing demand for fish, and also partly due to higher prices for fish. In an attempt to reduce the by-catch from trawl fishers, States have introduced turtle exclusion devices. Venezuela is also experimenting with the use of fish exclusion devices.
Finally, it should be noted that a number of States in the WECAFC Region are in the process of improving their monitoring, control and surveillance capacity which is not limited to fishing only.
Compliance Agreement:
Although the Agreement is not yet in force, two States in the WECAFC region have formally accepted the Agreement: United States of America and St. Kitts/Nevis. Other States in the region have adopted elements of the Agreement into their fisheries legislation.
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Compliance Agreement:
The IWC applies the precautionary approach in their work on aboriginal subsistence whaling which is still permitted and regulated. Apart from this application, the Code of Conduct is not specifically applied to "fishery" management as commercial whaling is prohibited at the present time.
The IWC have concerns with regard to reflagged, unauthorized or illegal whaling, and they are currently using DNA tracking to attempt an investigation of the origins of whale meat on sale in certain markets.
ASIA-PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION
The 1996 APFIC publication, "APFIC and the Sustainable Development of Southeast Asian Fisheries" discusses the international instruments and initiatives having implications on Southeast Asian Fisheries.
Agenda 21:
The publication notes that because of the mandates set forth in Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 regarding the protection, rational use and development of living resources in the oceans, seas, and coastal areas, the implementation of the Agenda 21 principles will have far reaching implications on the future policies and strategies of the Southeast Asian countries in their efforts to implement sustainable development of fishery resources. It continues that the process of application will be long-term and that:
"it is thus essential that the countries concerned set priorities among a large number of important actions that are called for in this implementation. Some prioritized actions can be implemented at the sub-regional and regional levels to reduce the implementation costs and avoid the duplication of efforts."
The publication also considers initiatives to deal with problems of environmental degradation. Noting that particular problems exist in Southeast Asia of habitat destruction and decline in water quality due to pollution, which has resulted in a loss of both biodiversity and the abundance of fishery resources in coastal and inshore waters, the report provides that a number of programmes by international and regional organizations have been commenced to address these issues. These include UNEPs Regional Sea Programme for East Asian Sea; World Conservation Union's CITES, GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Programme for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas (MPP-EAS), and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (as discussed below) that are designed to assist the countries in the region to maintain environmental quality and prevention and control of pollution.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
The APFIC publication, "APFIC and the Sustainable Development of Southeast Asian Fisheries" makes a recommendation that the governments in the region monitor developments in international initiatives aimed at the sustainable development of straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in particular, the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the 1995 UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. It continues:
"As there are several existing regional fishery bodies, which may result in possible duplication of effort, serious consideration should be made by the countries in the region as to whether a new regional mechanism should be developed or an existing body enhanced, in the long term, to help coordinate cooperative research programmes; to improve data and information required; to jointly manage the exploited transboundary stocks; to harmonize fisheries management policies including the monitoring, control and surveillance of these fisheries; and to make recommendations to fishery bodies at the national level. Because of the extent of the transboundary migration of a large number of fish stocks in the region, the South China Sea is considered to be an appropriate management unit for the purpose of coordination and making recommendations."
The publication concludes with a call for the strengthening of the Activities of APFIC and a note that the potential of the Commission depends upon the political will of its Members.
JOINT TECHNICAL COMMISSION FOR THE ARGENTINA/URUGUAY MARITIME BOUNDARY
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the precautionary approach:
Both member parties have given endorsement to the FAO Code of Conduct. The Commission itself is aware of the Code, but has not yet taken a formal position on it. The precautionary approach is taken into account in the fisheries management work of the Commission.
The Compliance Agreement:
The Commission has not taken a formal position on the Compliance Agreement and there are no problems with reflagged fishing vessels, or unauthorized, or illegal fishing within the Common Fishing Zone.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
Since 1976, the Commission has worked on implementing many of the provisions eventually given recognition in this Agreement. This includes working to ensure the long term sustainability of straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks, allocating allowable catches, or levels of fishing effort, obtaining and evaluating scientific advice on the impact of fishing, and establishing cooperative mechanisms for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement.
NORTH PACIFIC ANADROMOUS FISH COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach:
As the only managerial measure that the Commission undertakes is prohibition of the direct fishing for salmon in the Convention Area, consolidated by the minimizing to the maximum extent of any incidental taking of this fish, further application of the precautionary approach is considered inapplicable.
Compliance Agreement:
NPAFC have no formal position on the Compliance Agreement despite the fact that they have problems with illegal fishing for salmon on the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean by vessels of non-member countries. During 1993-1998 there were several sightings of violations, which resulted in the seizure of the vessels and punishment by the vessels' flag authorities. In view of the policy that no country is allowed to fish for salmon within the Convention Area, NPAFC policy is to enforce implementation of the prohibition of fishing.
NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC FISHERIES COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach:
There is an ongoing discussion about the application of the precautionary approach.
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
The Code is taken into account when considering new measures such as is being done by a current NEAFC working group on evaluating the structure and functions of the Commission. The stated objective of this working group is to:
"evaluate the structure and function of the Commission:
* measured against the provisions of the Convention, and
* in light of the 1982 Convention and the development of relevant international law, in particular the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries."
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement is taken into account when establishing catch limits. These are also determined by advice from ICES when establishing TACs on a sustainable basis. TACs are set for blue whiting, oceanic redfish and Norwegian spring spawning herring.
Regarding the RFB requirement for cooperative mechanisms for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement, NEAFC has put substantial effort into the task of developing a comprehensive control and enforcement scheme. This scheme, (Recommendation on Control and Enforcement Measures in Respect of Fishing Vessels Fishing in Areas Beyond the Limits of National Fisheries Jurisdiction in the Convention Area), was adopted at an extraordinary meeting in July and will come into force in 1999.
Compliance Agreement
NEAFC has no formal policy in regard to the Compliance Agreement despite problems with reflagged, unauthorized or illegal fishing within the Convention Area. The problem is currently being addressed by the Contracting Parties which have agreed to exchange information about such incidents.
COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries:
To promote and encourage the implementation of the Code, the CCSBT is in the process of reviewing the provisions of the Convention in order to determine the action necessary to achieve compatibility with the Code. The precautionary approach to fisheries management is currently under discussion as the CCSBT parties attempt to reach agreement on the state of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock. The problems of by-catch and discards impacts heavily upon seabirds and measures have been implemented to mitigate sea-bird by-catch during longline fishing operation (e.g. by the use of Tori poles). Investigations by the ERSWG are researching how to further mitigate the by-catch problem.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
In conformity with the provisions of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, CCSBT receives advice of the management measures adopted by Members. Advice is also received from the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, which are not Members, but which take significant quantities of SBT. This advice is used in the assessment of the state of the SBT stock.
The Agreement provides that all relevant coastal States or States fishing for Highly Migratory Stocks and Straddling Stocks shall cooperate by becoming members of the relevant RFB, or agree to the measures of the relevant RFB. In the case of CCSBT, not all relevant coastal States, or States fishing for SBT on the high seas, are Members. States which take significant quantities of SBT but are not Members of the CCSBT are the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Korea. South Africa is also a relevant coastal State, but its national do not take SBT. Discussions, based on an Action Plan adopted by the CCSBT in January 1998, are in progress with potential new members, which include arrangements for accommodating their fishing interests.
In order to establish a cooperative mechanism for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement, CCSBT has established a subsidiary body, the Compliance Committee, to develop a cooperative monitoring and compliance system under the provisions of the Convention.
On the requirement for giving publicity to the conservation and management measures established by the RFB, members of the CCSBT publish significant decisions by media releases. Meeting reports are published on the World Wide Web and printed copies of reports are available on request.
Compliance Agreement:
Members of the CCSBT exchange information on fishing activities of vessels flying the flag of States which are not members. Measures to deter their activity are to be developed. No serious violations against the conservation and management measures established under the Convention, have been encountered.
LATIN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERIES
Regarding the more recent international instruments, the formal position of OLDEPESCA is noted in the following summary on the Programme of Support for the Regional Implementation of International Fisheries Instruments which is currently being executed by OLDEPESCA in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank.
"In the face of inadequate provisions in the [1982 Convention] and other problems related to fisheries inside and outside zones under national jurisdiction, and as a result of joint initiatives by FAO and interested States, which were examined at technical meetings and at UNCED, it was agreed that efforts should be made to prepare new international rules and regulations.
* in accordance with its objectives as facilitator and coordinator of fisheries cooperation and development in the region;
* in follow up to the mandates issued by the Ministerial Meetings of the Member Countries; and
* pursuant to the cooperation responsibilities envisaged in the 1982 Convention and other international instruments for regional and subregional organizations, OLDEPESCA was very active in helping develop this process by means of consultation meetings and the publication of documents with specific proposals on the issues under examination.
On completion of negotiations for the formulation of new international fisheries instruments, the OLDEPESCA Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Programme was set up to help national administrations examine the two following documents:
* UN Fish Stocks Agreement; and
* The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Despite its voluntary status, this is the most complete instrument so far devised for fisheries.
The Technical Cooperation Programme signed by OLDEPESCA and IDB includes components to help the fisheries administrations of Latin American and Caribbean countries with criteria and actions that will facilitate analysis of the above international management instruments, the ultimate aim being to develop sustainable fishing activity.
The specific objectives of the Technical Cooperation are to:
* help evaluate the possible implications of national fishery legislation and the provisions laid down in international agreements;
* determine the priority actions needed with regard to mechanisms of consultation, monitoring and information exchange at regional level; and
* promote dissemination and understanding of the implications for regional fisheries of the international instruments.
This Programme has been under development since January 1998 in the framework of a pilot plan involving Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
INTERNATIONAL BALTIC SEA FISHERY COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach and Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries:
The regulatory measures applied by IBSFC are in line with the objectives of the Code. Increased attention is being given to the provisions of Article 7 Fisheries Management such as management objectives and application of the precautionary approach. Pending ongoing analysis by ICES, IBSFC intends to adopt within short stocks specific target reference points and limit reference points, as provided for in Article 7.5.3 of the Code.
IBSFC at its Extraordinary Session on Agenda 21 for the Baltic Sea Region, Sector Fisheries, held in Warsaw from 16-29 February 1998 adopted an Action Programme for sustainable development including targets, time frames, actors and financing. These include an Action Programme for Baltic Cod, Salmon 1997-2010, and a Long Term Strategy for Pelagic Species.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Compliance Agreement:
The IBSFC area has no high seas and is therefore not formally subject to the application of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. There are no reports of unauthorized fishing within the IBSFC area and reflagged fishing vessels do not constitute a problem for the Members.
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNA
Resolutions of ICCAT have affirmed a commitment to the concept of responsible fishing, as established within the framework of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. ICCAT is working to apply the Code, and the precautionary approach to the Commission's activities. They have also noted the need for compliance with the Resolutions of the United Nations on prevention of overfishing. Conservation and management measures have been supported by resolutions which call for contracting Parties to prohibit the import of Atlantic bluefin tuna in any form from Belize, Honduras and Panama, where fishing practices are not consistent with ICCAT measures.
Each year, the Executive Secretary of ICCAT contacts all non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities known to be fishing in the Convention area for species under ICCAT competence to urge each of them to become a Contracting Party to ICCAT or to attain status as a Cooperating Party, Entity, or Fishing Entity.
Further resolutions have addressed the subjects of catch reduction, statistical document programs, vessel monitoring system pilot program, transhipments and vessel sightings, unreported catches,pelagic driftnet fishing, by-catch, longline fishing, revision of ICCAT Port Inspection Schemes.
INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION
I-ATTC Convention Resolution of 17 June 1998, notes that its establishing Convention was signed in 1949, and therefore does not take into account subsequent changes in international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the 1992 Agenda 21 and Rio Declaration, the 1993 Compliance Agreement, the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement. The Commission agrees to establish a working group of its Members, (and open to other governments of coastal States and other States and regional economic integration organizations, whose vessels are operating in the tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean,) and which have the intention of adhering to the Convention, to review the functions of the I-ATTC and its Convention and, if necessary, formulate possible amendments to the Convention.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
On the requirement for all relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas to be members of the relevant RFB, I-ATTC note that Belize, Colombia, Cyprus, Honduras, Mexico, and Spain are non-Member States whose flag vessels are fishing in the I-ATTC area. Mexico and Colombia have indicated they will join the I-ATTC. In respect of Spain, the European Community has sole competence for international fishing matters, and has expressed an interest in joining. Currently, this is impossible because the convention for the IATTC does not provide for Regional Economic Integration Organizations to become a party. The I-ATTC is in the process of considering whether to agree to a change in the convention which would allow the EC to join. Colombia, Mexico and Spain are members of the International Dolphin Conservation Program (IDCP).
The I-ATTC works to ensure the long-term sustainability of straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks by resolutions recommending limits on the catch of yellowfin and bigeye tuna. Similarly, dolphin mortality limits by IDCP ensure the sustainability of dolphin stocks.
FORUM FISHERIES AGENCY AND PACIFIC COMMUNITY
The SPC exists to encourage and strengthen international cooperation in promoting the economic and social welfare and advancement of the peoples of the South Pacific Region. At the Eleventh Meeting of the Standing Committee on Tuna and Billfish Workshop, the following conclusions were reached:
* the development of an overall precautionary management framework for tuna fisheries of the western and central Pacific requires the collaboration of scientists, fisheries managers and industry;
* the delivery of scientific advice using limit reference points is only one component of a precautionary management framework. The implementation and monitoring of harvest or other fishery control measures are also essential components of the overall framework;
* the avoidance of recruitment overfishing (reduction of the adult biomass to the point where there is a significant risk of recruitment collapse) should be the major objective of fisheries management;
* at least two limit reference points are required to express this objective: a percentage of the maximum observed spawning biomass beyond which the stock must not be allowed to fall, and a level of fishing mortality which should not be exceeded in any year;
* stock assessments which should be based on the best possible science, should provide estimates of uncertainty regarding the stock status and the impact of fishing on the stock, and be presented in such a way that enables transparent management decision making;
* where formal stock assessments cannot be undertaken because of lack of data, a suite of fishery indicators, based on statistics such as catch-per-unit-effort, average size of fish caught and the spatial range of the fishery, may be used as provisional reference points. The utility and robustness of such indicators should first be assessed using simulation models;
* while there will likely be a requirement to provide scientific advice on non-target, associated and dependent species, there is presently insufficient data on which to base assessments in most cases. Additional data collection, fishery monitoring and research will be required; and
* the current levels of funding support for data collection, research and stock assessment of tuna fisheries of the western and central Pacific are insufficient (<1 percent of the value of the catch). Funding support will need to be increased substantially to allow management of this valuable fishery to be guided by good science.
The FFA provides regular updates on the status of international fisheries conventions. Its role is merely advisory and advice is given to enable the Parties to implement their obligations under the various international fisheries conventions. In this way, FFA assists in ensuring that regional and international obligations are incorporated into domestic legislation. Furthermore, FFA undertakes periodic reviews of domestic legislation to ensure that they are consistent with regional and international agreements.
The FFA are currently working on the implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. However, this same subject is being addressed through the Multilateral High Level Conference on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific.
SOUTH PACIFIC PERMANENT COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries:
The precautionary approach is mainly considered for intensive fisheries with high yields. CPPS has distributed invitations to meetings that will consider the implementation of the Code of Conduct.
Compliance Agreement and UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
CPPS has no formal position on the Compliance Agreement. There are problems with vessels fishing illegally in zones of national jurisdiction. CPPS notes that Members need to demonstrate their sovereignty towards such vessels.
Members have their own responsibility for ensuring the long term conservation of fishery resources, allocating allowable catches according to fishing effort at various levels, and coordinating cooperative mechanisms for the development and management of fisheries. Any impact on fishery resources is taken into consideration by each Member, and assessed constantly. This is done by Members acting autonomously.
With regard to high seas fisheries, a model of agreement is being prepared on transboundary fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in the South-east Pacific. This model takes into account technical, scientific, jurisdictional and economical aspects.
INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
Use of the precautionary approach and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries:
IOTC is currently involved in a proposed workshop involving FAO and other regional RFBs that will consider applying the precautionary approach to regional fisheries management in relation to objective reference points. The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries has been discussed within Commission Sessions. As yet there is no formal position yet by IOTC on the provisions of the Code.
Compliance Agreement:
IOTC Members have problems with illegal fishing within EEZs and fleets operating under open registry flags are a major potential issue for the region. There is no formal position by IOTC on the Compliance Agreement.
UN Fish Stocks Agreement:
The body of IOTC exists to achieve long term sustainability of stocks. Decisions regarding allocation of catches may be taken at a later date in view of known (or suspected) stock status. Scientific advice is currently provided through technical working parties. Data reporting on HMS and SS is not yet implemented. Regarding the requirement for all fishing States relevant to, or operating in, the IOTC area, to be members of the relevant RFB (in this case, IOTC), Taiwan, Province of China, the Maldives, Oman, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Yemen are the major Indian Ocean tuna fishing States or entities still missing from IOTC. Other coastal States with more minor catch levels have also not joined. Open registry States, as described above, may be relevant to participation in IOTC, but have also not joined.
COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES
Use of the Precautionary Approach
CCAMLR is one of the organizations managing international fisheries which pioneered this approach. It is based on the principles of conservation which are set out in Article II of the CCAMLR Convention. They encompass both the precautionary approach, according to which prudent foresight should be exercised in order to avoid taking decisions which have a high risk of long-term adverse effects, and also an ecosystem approach, i.e. the adoption of precautionary catch limits aimed at ensuring that the effects of fishing on prey populations are limited to a level which will be unlikely to have a major impact on predators. In accordance with the precautionary approach, the greater the degree of uncertainty in the assessment of exploited resources and of their functional relationship with other elements of the Antarctic ecosystem, the greater the degree of fisheries management control imposed.
In addition to developments related to the implementation of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme, the following element of the precautionary approach have been already implemented by CCAMLR for managing fisheries in the Convention Area:
a. measures to take into account uncertainty in resource assessments;
b. prior notification an management of new and exploratory fisheries;
c. protection of non-targeted fish species, including by-catch limits;
d. technical measures and season limitations to reduce incidental mortality of seabirds in longline and trawl fisheries;
e. a ban on the use of plastic packaging bands, in which marine mammals can become entangled, for bait boxes and other uses; and
f. prohibition of a large-scale pelagic drift-net-fishing in the CCAMLR Convention Area.
Other Management Intitiatives
In their efforts to deal with the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities within the CCAMLR zone, the Commission has noted international initiatives, including the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the FAO Compliance Agreement.
Further, the report of the Sixteenth Meeting of CCAMLR held in Hobart, 27 October-7 November 1997 notes at paragraph 5.25 that several measures to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities could be drawn from the experience of other organizations, in particular NAFO and ICCAT. Other measures took into account recent developments in international law, in particular the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the Compliance Agreement. The Commission encouraged all members of CCAMLR to become parties to these Agreements as soon as possible.
In addition, CCAMLR has started developing an integrated set of political and legal measures to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The set of measures adopted by the Commission in 1997 includes new Conservation Measures 118/XVI (Scheme to Promote Compliance by non-Contracting Party Vessels with CCAMLR Conservation Measures), and 119/XVI (Requirement for Contracting parties to Licence their Flag Vessels in the Convention Area), as well as Resolution 12/XVI on VMS, and amendments to the text of the System of Inspection and mechanisms to address the actions of non-Contracting Parties. The November 1998 CCAMLR meeting will review the effectiveness of the adopted measures and, if necessary, develop additional measures. In particular, CCAMLR will further consider measures related to port State control, as well as trade-related measures.
CONCLUSION/SUMMARY ON CHAPTER
This chapter commenced with a basic premise that world marine capture fisheries are in crisis from the point of view of sustainable utilization. This premise has been supported by discussion on the three critical issues effecting the state of world marine capture fisheries:
* the problem of overfishing - including the use of insufficiently selective fishing gear which leads to waste in the form of by-catch and discards;
* inadequate monitoring, control and surveillance of vessels in both zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas - including the problem of reflagging and the need for better flag and port State controls; and
* environmental degradation of fish habitats.
The paper submits that to the extent that the law can provide solutions to these problems, significant progress has been made. Within this contemporary legal regime for fisheries, RFBs are given an increasingly important role for the conservation and management of world marine capture fisheries. Both the international community of States and RFBs should view these Agreements and instruments as providing a check-list that will enable RFBs to effectively fulfil this management role.
The implementation of many of the recent international fishery instruments requirements for RFBs may frequently require amendment of the RFB founding agreement, constitution or convention. In many cases, the original terms of reference or mandates were constructed in an era pre-dating the 1990s instruments. However, from information made available to FAO, the General Fishery Commission for the Mediterranean recently amended its agreement to accommodate the provisions of these recent instruments. Many FAO RFBs are acting to investigate just how their mandates would need to be amended in order to allow them to implement the above mentioned requirements.
Based on materials provided by RFBs and information from other published sources, the general conclusion from the review is that while most RFBs are investigating and reviewing, through appropriately constituted working groups, how best to address the above issues, very few RFBs have to date actually taken concrete steps towards implementing the desired regime. Bearing in mind the difficulty of the task, this conclusion is perhaps not surprising. The instruments described in this report present complex scientific, managerial and political constraints that cannot be resolved quickly.
However, in view of the major role that the international community is now assigning to RFBs as a means of facilitating sustainable utilization of world marine capture fisheries, the deficiencies apparent with the current state of regional fisheries management must be addressed in a more comprehensive and rational manner. Under existing international law and within the current paradigm for the management of shared fish stocks, RFBs provide the only realistic option for the conservation and management of these stocks.

V. CONCLUSION
Throughout the 1990s, the international community has made several attempts to enhance and develop the legal framework for fisheries management described in the 1982 Convention. Such negotiations have led to the adoption of the 1992 Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, the 1993 Compliance Agreement, the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the 1995 Rome Consensus on World Fisheries, the 1995 Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action, and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement. Contemporary fishery issues referred to in these instruments include, inter alia, excess fleet capacity; by-catch and discards; MCS of fishing fleets; measures to enhance data collection; and application of the precautionary approach. This report has examined the extent to which the above mentioned instruments have, or have not, been implemented by both FAO and non-FAO RFBs.
For the purposes of this report, the broad definition of RFBs offered by FAO in the 1998 Text of Documents Placed Before the High Level Panel of External Experts in Fisheries, has been adopted with one qualification and a few important bilateral arrangements have been included in the present review.
The report reaffirms that current international relations are marked by a division between wealthy, developed States and a majority of less wealthy and poor developing States, and that international cooperation is needed to address inequities and fulfil the provisions of the "world order" envisaged by major international agreements such as the UN Charter, the 1982 Convention, and the subsequent international fisheries instruments. RFBs play a significant role in expressing and developing the notion of regional cooperation. This fact has been recognized by the international community which has given an increasingly important role to RFBs for the conservation and management of marine capture fisheries. The consequence is that RFBs must now be viewed as critical to the successful implementation of the international fisheries regime.
The report has noted that for RFBs to implement the requirements contained in the various instruments, there is likely to be a necessity for the body to amend its founding agreement, constitution or convention. In many cases, the original RFB terms of reference or mandates were constructed in an era pre-dating the 1990s instruments. However, from information made available to FAO in the course of this study, only two RFBs are acting to investigate just how their mandates should be amended to allow them to implement the above mentioned requirements.
Partly as a consequence of this legal lack of ability to implement changes in the legal regime, the report has concluded that few RFBs have achieved real progress in addressing the post-1982 fishery instruments. This conclusion should be qualified by noting that many RFBs are at least examining through appropriately constituted working groups, the implementation of the instruments. The importance of applying the precautionary approach to the conservation and management of marine capture fisheries is demonstrated by the fact that all but one of the RFBs under review, are examining the application of the approach to their respective regimes. However, only nine RFBs have actually taken concrete steps to implement the precautionary approach, in some measure, within their respective regimes. RFBs initiating measures to more fully comply with the total provisions of the post-1982 instruments, are much fewer in number.
This conclusion is perhaps not surprising. The post 1982 instruments present complex scientific, managerial and political considerations that cannot be resolved quickly. Furthermore, other factors impacting upon the RFB capacity to address the functions described in these fishery instruments are elaborated within the report. Specifically, these include the problems of incongruent fishery interests amongst Contracting Parties within a RFB, funding and staffing difficulties which weaken the ability of some secretariats to function effectively, and lack of political will on the part of many Contracting Parties to accept and/or implement the international instruments described above.
The final result of this state of affairs is that despite international expectations for RFBs to more effectively conserve and manage marine capture fisheries. There is little facility for this to occur unless their rules and functions are strengthened as presented in recent international fishery instruments. The strengthening of regional fisheries management must be addressed in a more comprehensive and rational manner if sustainable utilization of the resources is to be achieved. This is critical because under existing international law, and within the current paradigm for the management of shared fish stocks, RFBs provide the only realistic option for the conservation and management of these stocks.

SECTION 1. INTRODUCTION
In studying the state of the fish stocks and the effect of fishing on them, the fishery biologist should carry out his analysis in precise quantitative terms. To do this he must use mathematics, and to use mathematics the complexities of the real situation must be replaced by more or less simplified and abstract mathematical models. Such models may be used to represent both quantities of interest (abundance of the population, size of the individual fish), and the relation between these quantities.
In their simplest form, mathematical models are regularly used by biologists; for instance, it is commonplace to represent the size of a fish by the number of centimetres between the tip of its jaw and the end of its caudal fin. This model conceals many factors about the actual fish - whether it is fat or thin, or whether it is a cod or a tuna - but enables many analyses to be carried out - e.g. the construction of a length-frequency distribution of a sample of the fish population.
The value of a model may be judged by its simplicity and the closeness with which events or values predicted by the model fit the actual observation. A model cannot be considered as being either right or wrong, but as giving a satisfactory fit to the facts over a wide or narrow range of situations. A good model is one that is simple, but gives a good fit over a wide range.
The best test of a model is its usefulness in prediction; in this sense prediction covers not only the prediction of future events but also any values or events not considered in proposing the model. Thus a model describing the growth of cod in length may be proposed from the analysis of data of mean length at age; it will be a more useful model if, subject to the fitting of a minimum number of constants, it can be used to predict (estimate) the mean length at age of haddock, or any other species.
All the models described in this manual have proved to a greater or lesser extent to be useful models in that they have provided useful quantitative descriptions of events in various fisheries. Most have also been successful in making predictions, in the sense used above. A good example of the testing of a model by a successful prediction is the analysis of the Antarctic whale stocks. At the 1963 meeting of the International Whaling Commission there was considerable discussion on the quota, in terms of numbers of whales caught, to be set for the 1963/64 season. The Commission's Committee of Three Scientists had devised a model for the population of Antarctic fin whales, taking into account the probable rates of mortality and recruitment, etc. On the basis of this model the Committee had recommended that in order to rebuild the depleted stocks, not more than 5 000 fin whales should be killed, but that if whaling activities were continued at the 1962/63 rate about 14 000 fin
whales would be caught, equivalent, including catches of other whales, to some 8 500 Blue Whale Units (BWU). Members of the Commission were unwilling to make so large a reduction in the quota from that for the 1962/63 season (15 000 BWU), and therefore agreed on a quota of 10 000 BWU for 1963/64. This gave no effective restriction on whaling activities, and the catches were very close to the predicted values (13 870 fin whales, and a total of 8 429 BWU).
Such close agreement between observed and predicted values was partly a matter of luck, that is, certain assumptions made in constructing the model were quite closely fulfilled. In particular the model assumed that some factors influencing the catch, such as the weather and the skill of the gunners were, in the 1963/64 season, close to the average of previous seasons. These assumptions were nearly fulfilled, but a slight difference in weather or in the skill of a few gunners could have increased the difference between observed and predicted catches to perhaps three or four hundred animals. The closeness of the agreement did not prove that the model is correct, or that a slightly different model might not give a rather closer fit, but does prove that the model used can predict within useful limits the results of one pattern of whaling activity. Presumably the model could also predict the results of other patterns of activity, and in particular the result of a severe
restriction in catches for a period long enough to allow the stocks to rebuild. Therefore the model serves as a usable basis for managing the whale resources.
As in the whale example, most models include simplifying assumptions about the factors which are not of immediate interest (e.g. weather), usually stated, when stated explicitly, in the form "assuming the conditions are constant." This should not be taken to mean that the validity of the model depends on the constancy of these conditions, and that the model should not be used if conditions vary. Rather it means that for the purposes for which the model has been constructed, the variations caused by these conditions are not of primary interest, and will be ignored.
This manual is mainly concerned with studying the effect of fishing on the stocks and on the catches; it is, therefore, essentially concerned with the long-term effects. Also when predicting the catch from a given pattern of fishing the important question is often not the absolute amount of catch but the catch relative to that which would have been taken with some other pattern of fishing. Many fluctuations and variations are therefore irrelevant to the purposes of this manual. For instance, very often the average catch per trawl haul is taken as a measure of the abundance of the stock; the actual catch taken in one haul will depend on a large number of factors, e.g. the size of the trawler, the skill of the skipper, the precise ground, the season, the weather and the time of day, some of which may have a considerably greater influence on the catch of that particular haul than the overall abundance of the stock. Fish population dynamics is not however concerned with studying
or predicting the catch of one haul, but the average catch over a period, say a year. Most of these factors will have average annual values which are effectively constant from year to year, and thus can be ignored; only if these annual values vary, and particularly if they show a trend (e.g. an increase in the average size of trawler) may they have to be studied in detail.
When comparing the catches from two different patterns of fishing, e.g. trawling with large or small meshes in the cod-end, even year-to-year fluctuations can often be ignored. For instance, variations in recruitment may make big differences to the catch in any one year, but will not in general affect the conclusion that say with the present amount of fishing, the use of meshes of 120 mm in the cod-end will give sustained catches 5 percent larger than those taken when meshes of 110 mm are used.
Any model will eventually have to be replaced or modified, possibly merely by adding a little complexity to take into account further factors (e.g. weather conditions in the whale example above) to attain rather greater precision, or perhaps being replaced by a different model. In any case, the process of construction of a model, testing it, and modifying or replacing it is an essential part of the study and eventual understanding of the dynamics of fish populations, or indeed any subject of scientific study. The process of model construction is the complement of the collection of data, and in fact it is only by constructing and using models that it is possible to decide what data should be collected.
The basic model used in nearly the whole of this manual is one in which the stock considered is taken as being self contained, and the various factors causing the stock to change are considered separately. These factors are as follows:
Recruitment (see section 7) Growth of individuals (see section 3)
Deaths due to fishing; these will be determined by the fishing effort (see sections 4 and 5.3)
Deaths due to other causes (see section 5)
The changes with age in these factors and in the total weight of a year-class are illustrated in Figure 1.1. This shows the growth in weight of the individual; the decrease in the numbers of individuals (the full line shows the decrease in the absence of fishing, the broken line the decrease if fishing occurs after some age, t[c]); and the total weight of the stock. The last has a maximum at some intermediate age, the "critical" age of Ricker.
In the early sections each of these factors are considered separately, and the models are developed to describe each in quantitative terms. In the final sections the factors are combined to provide a quantitative model for the changes in total weight of the stock, and in catch, for various patterns of fishery. The modifications to the model which are necessary to take into account interactions between the various factors, e.g. that increased fishing will reduce the stock and therefore may affect the recruitment, are discussed briefly in section 11.

2.1.1 Introduction
In the analysis of a fishery and in stock assessment one is mainly interested in changes. They can be changes in the number of a stock with time, changes in weight of a fish with age, changes in yield with changes in the fishing effort, etc.
Changes with time are measured as rates, i.e. the change in the magnitude of the quantity (weight, etc.) considered divided by the period of time during which it occurred. Even if the time interval is not explicitly specified, unit time (e.g. one year) is usually to be inferred and thus the change is implicitly a rate.
Theoretical models have the advantage of permitting the analysis of the influence of some factors by studying the mathematical properties of the models. For mathematical simplicity in these models and elsewhere instantaneous rates are often used.
Instantaneous rates can be taken as the limit of the mean rates when the period of time, D t, tends to zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to the concept of the derivative.
The hypotheses to be made on the relationships between instantaneous rates and the variables can be expressed in the form of differential equations. The differential and integral calculus are important mathematical tools in the analysis of the dynamics of population and other systems. Some of these hypotheses lead to the exponential, logarithmic and power functions.
For the above-mentioned reasons a quick review of powers, exponential and log functions, as well as of differential and integral calculus, is important. Granville, Smith and Longley's Elements of the differential and integral calculus deals extensively with such matters.
2.1.2 Functions
Let x and y denote two variables. If to each value of x corresponds a value of y then we can say that y is a function of x or symbolically y =f (x). Graphically, if we plot the values of x on the abscissa (horizontal) axis and the corresponding values of y on the ordinate (vertical) axis, the curve joining the points, P (x, y), with abscissa x and ordinate y, is a graphical representation of the function y = f (x):
FIGURE 2.1.
Perhaps the simplest and one of the most used functions is the linear function y = a + bx where a and b are constants. Its graphical representation is a straight line with the intercept on the axis of y equal to a and the slope equal to b:
FIGURE 2.2.
When a = 0 then y = bx, which represents a straight line passing through the origin. This relationship states that y and x are directly proportional (Figure 2.3.1). For the special case b = 1, the equation y = x is the bisector of the positive quadrant (Figure 2.3.2).
FIGURE 2.3.1.
FIGURE 2.3.2.
The figure below shows the position of the straight line for different values of b
FIGURE 2.4.
Another way of writing the linear function is:
y - y[0] = b (x - x[0]) where (x[0], y[0]) is one point of the line.
This form is especially useful when we know two points of the line and we wish to formulate the equation. Thus, if one point is (x[0], y[0]) and the other is (x[1], y[1]) the line will pass through both if b satisfies the equation y[1] - y[0] = b (x[1] - x[0]), that is, b = (y[1] - y[0])/ (x[1] - x[0]). The equation can then be written immediately.
In a linear function the mean absolute rate of change of y with x is constant and equal to the slope. Thus the instantaneous absolute rate is also constant and its value is the slope b.
For any other function the mean absolute rate between two values x[0] and x[1], is the slope of the straight line passing through the points (x[0], y[0]) and (x[1], y[1])
FIGURE 2.5.
Another very useful function is the parabola, also called the second degree polynomial, y = a + bx + cx^2
FIGURE 2.6.
The equation can sometimes be written in the form: y = A (x - x[0]) (x - x[1]) where x[0] and x[1] are the intercepts on the x-axis and the sign of the constant A determines whether it is concave upward or downward.
FIGURE 2.7.1.
FIGURE 2.7.2.
FIGURE 2.7.3.
The exponential function y = a^x where a is a positive constant has the graphical representation shown in Figures 2.8.1 and 2.8.2.
FIGURE 2.8.1.
FIGURE 2.8.2.
An exponential function commonly used for its mathematical convenience is the one with a equal to the mathematical constant e.
Some curves have an asymptote, i.e. a straight line to which the curve approaches closer and closer as x becomes extremely large (or extremely small); more precisely they are tangents to the curve when x = ¥ (or - ¥). For example: y = ax with a < 1 (see Figure 2.8.1) has the asymptote y = 0; the curves y = 1 - e^-2x and y = 1 - e^-2x both have the asymptote y = 1, the second one approaching this asymptote rather more quickly.
FIGURE 2.9.
It is always possible to transform a mathematical function into a straight line relation by a suitable transformation of variables. This is often useful when fitting a theoretical, and possibly complicated curve to observed data; the fitting of a straight line, either graphically by eye, or by regression techniques is relatively simple. Fitting more complex curves, e.g. the exponential, is more difficult, either by eye or by calculation. It should be noted that the least square regression (or other fitted curve) which uses the arithmetic means of the transformed variables will probably not coincide with the arithmetic mean of the original variables, e.g. using the transformation w = log x, the arithmetic mean of the w's is the geometric mean of the x's.
As we will see later, the curve relating the number of fish of a year-class alive at time t can be expressed as N[t] = N[0]e^-Zt and can be transformed into the straight line y = a + bt, where a = log[e]N[0] and b = - Z, using the logarithmic transformation y = log[e]N.

FIGURE 2.10.2.
2.1.3 Powers and logarithms
When the base is positive the power is positive, but when the base is negative the power is positive if the exponent is even and negative if the exponent is odd.
It is useful to consider the value of a power when the exponent n increases without limit.
If the base a is greater than 1 then a^n also increases without limit.
If the base a is equal to 1 then a^n is equal to 1 for all values of n.
If the base a is smaller than 1 (and positive) then a^n tends to 0.
Some useful rules for multiplying or dividing powers are:
- Powers with the same base
- Powers with the same exponent
To raise a power to an exponent, the base is raised to the product of the exponents:
(a^n)^m = a^nm
The function y = a^n can be considered in two ways depending on whether the base a, or the exponent n is considered as the variable of interest. In the form y = x^n (i.e. the base is the variable) it is called a power function; in the form y = a^x (i.e. the exponent is the variable) it is called an exponential function.
The inverse function of a power is a root and the inverse function of an exponential is a logarithmic function. Thus if y = a^x then x = log[a]y, or x is the logarithm of y to the base a.
When the base is the constant e, the logarithms are called natural or Napierian (or hyperbolic).
From the definition above one can see that the properties of the powers will imply corresponding properties of the logarithms, e.g.
log[a][ ](A · B) = log[a] A + log[a] B corresponds to the property a^x · a^y = a^x+y
log[a] (A^m) = m log[a] A corresponds to the property (a^x)^y == a^xy
Special relations can also be obtained, such as log[a] 1 = 0 and log[a] a = 1. The relation between the logs of a number on two different bases, a and b, is:
log[a] N = log[b] N · log[a] b
The bases most used for logs are the base 10 and the base e (e » 2.72), the former because 10 is the basis of the numerical system currently used and the latter because this results in the most simple form of several mathematical relationships. From the above relation the logarithm of a number to the base e can be obtained from the logarithm of the number on base 10 multiplied by log[e] 10 ~ 2.303. This is a useful expression if a table of natural logs is not available. One of the advantages of using the base 10 is that any number can be expressed as the product of a power of 10 and a number between 1 and 10, e.g. 283.5 = 10^2 × 2.835; 0.0053 = 10^-3 × 5.3. In this way the decimal log of any number will be the sum of the decimal log of a number between 1 and 10 (mantissa) plus the decimal log of a power of 10, that is, its exponent (characteristic).
From the above examples this would give log[10] 283.5 = 2 + log[10] 2.835 and log[10] 0.0053 = -3 + log[10] 5.3. The logarithms to base 10 of the numbers between 1 and 10 are given by tables.
Tables of natural logarithms are usually available over a wider range (perhaps from 0.1 to 100) but natural logarithms can be obtained by a similar method for any range from tables of the natural logarithms from 1 to 10. For instance,
log[e] 283.5 = 2 log[e] 10 + log[e] 2.835 = 2 × 2.303 + 1.042 = 5.648 and
log[e] 0.0053 = - 3 log[e] 10 + log[e] 5.3 = - 3 × 2.303 + 1.667 = - 5.242
2.1.4 Derivatives
As already stated, the concept of derivative is equivalent to the absolute instantaneous rate and this is the limit of the absolute mean rate during an interval when the length of the interval tends to zero.
FIGURE 2.11.1.
FIGURE 2.11.2.
Thus derivative, absolute instantaneous rate and slope of the tangent are equivalent concepts expressed from different viewpoints. Using this definition, we can calculate the derivative of a function. For instance, to determine the derivative of y = 3x^2 we can start by calculating the increment of y for a given increment of x. We obtain the value of the function at the point x + D x and subtract from the value of the function at the point x:
at x
y = 3^x^2
at x + D x
y + D y = 3 (x + D x)^2 = 6xD x + 3D x^2
then D y = 6xD x + 3D x^2
Derivatives can be arrived at easily if we obtain, in that way. some rules, e.g.
Derivative of a constant, c, is zero:
Derivative of a variable x with respect to itself is:
Derivative of the product of a constant c and a function u (x) is the product of the constant and the derivative of the function:
Derivative of a sum of two functions, u (x) and v (x), is the sum of their derivatives:
Derivative of a product of two functions, u (x) and v (x), is given by
Derivative of a power of a function u (x) is given by
Derivative of the quotient of two functions, u (x) and v (x), is given by
We can also obtain from further analysis the derivative of special functions often used in fisheries studies, such as
(e^x)' = e^x
(e^u)' = e^uu'
It is interesting to note that the derivative of the function e^x is e^x itself; it is this property of the exponential of base e which makes it so important on theoretical grounds.
The derivative of the function y = e^ax is y' = e^axa = ay; this means that the derivative, or the instantaneous rate, of y is proportional to y, a property very useful in many situations (e.g. studies of growth, mortality, etc.).
As an example of how we could apply these rules let us calculate the derivative of y = (3 + e^2^x) (1 - x^2).
Applying the rule for a product we can write
To calculate the derivative of the first factor we can apply the rule concerning the sum of two functions, then (3 + e^2^x)' = (3)' + (e^2^x)'. We thus see that (3)'= 0 and (e^2^x)' = e^2^x (2 x)' = e^2x · 2 and thus (3 + e^2^x)'= 2e^2^x. Calculating the derivative of the other factor: (1 - x^2)' = (1)' - (x^2)' = 0 - 2x = - 2x. Finally y' = 2e^2^x (1 - x^2) - 2x (3 + e^2^x).
The derivative of a function of x is, in general, another function of x. This function may also be differentiated to give another function of x. This last is called the second derivative of the original function. It is usually represented by the symbols y¢ ¢ or d^2y/dx^2 and could be interpreted as the absolute rate of the absolute rate, which in physics is called acceleration. Third, fourth, etc. derivatives can also be defined.
An application of the first derivative is the analysis of the change of a function and of the second derivative the analysis of the rate at which this change is itself changing. For the points where y' is positive, y is increasing, and where y' is negative, y is decreasing. If y' = 0, y is a stationary point. When y¢ ¢ is positive the slope of the curve is increasing and the graph of y is concave upward; when y¢ ¢ is negative the slope of the curve is decreasing and the curve is concave downward. If y¢ ¢ = 0, y is an inflection point (unless y' was also 0). From the sign of y¢ ¢ we can decide if the stationary points are maxima or minima.
FIGURE 2.12.
2.1.5 Integrals
In the last section we saw how, given a function, we could obtain its derivative. The reverse problem would be to obtain the function knowing its derivative. This operation is called integration and the function so obtained is called the integral. For instance, what is the integral of 3x^2? We have seen that the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2, thus an integral of 3x^2 could be x^3. But so also is x^3 + 4 or generally x^3 + C where C is any constant, since the derivative of a constant is zero. This means that the integration of a function does not produce a simple function but a family of functions defined by the additive, arbitrary constant C.
The rules of integration can easily be obtained from the rules of differentiation, as they are inverse operations. Thus
Useful expressions are
A technique very useful for integration is the change of variable. For instance to integrate e^4^x^-3 we can put v = 4x - 3 and dv == (4x - 3)' dx or dv = 4 dx. Then
If one knows a value of the integrated function it is possible to determine the corresponding value for the constant C. In general terms we can say that if y = F (x) + C is the integral of a function, and knowing that (x[0], y[0]) is a point of the integral curve then y[0] = F (x[0]) + C and C = y[0] - F (x[0]); thus y - y[0] = F (x) - F (x[0]) gives the curve which satisfies the conditions of the problem.
We have seen the integration as the inverse operation of differentiation. There is however another concept of integral. This concept can be easily understood through the calculus of areas, which is one of the most important applications of integrals. Let us, for instance, calculate the area under the curve y =f (x), the axis of abscisses and the ordinates at x = a and x = b.
FIGURE 2.13.
To calculate the definite integral we calculate as before the indefinite integral and subtract its value for x = b and for x = a, this is:
As an example let us calculate the area under the function y = 3x^2 + 5 between x = 2 and x = X.
(Note that when calculating geometrical areas the values of the function and of its integral must be taken as positive.)
Another very important application of integrals is in solving differential equations. A differential equation is an equation with derivatives or differentials, for instance, y' = 4 x - 1 or dy = (5 + 2x) dx.
Now each member can be integrated separately:
The same result could be presented in a slightly different way by, instead of the constant C, using arbitrary point (x[0], y[0]), thus
and
This last expression can be very useful when one is interested in pointing out some special point of the function.
2.2 Statistics
Fish population studies involve the measurement and analysis of many quantities - e.g. age compositions, and growth rates - few of which can be measured exactly, either because of their inherent variability or the difficulty of measurement. Statistics must therefore be used to some extent, if only in such a simple form as taking the mean of a set of values. Basic statistical methods are the same whatever the subject in which they are being applied, and are described in many textbooks. These notes will therefore only deal very briefly with the basic methods. Some applications, e.g. correlation and regression analysis will be dealt with later as they occur. In this section most attention will be paid to the problem of sampling fish populations. (Statistics is dealt with in more detail in another manual in this series, in which both the basic methods and special applications to fisheries are described.)
In statistics we are concerned not so much with any individual value, e.g. the size of any one particular fish on the fish market, but with the frequency with which the various values (e.g. size of fish) occur. Such frequency distributions may be represented graphically, either as histograms or frequency polygons. Much of the frequency distributions can be described by two quantities; the average value (or the position of the curve) and the spread. The most common measures for the average are the arithmetic mean (or simply mean), the median (or half way value) and the mode (or most frequent). Of these the mean has most advantages. The common measure of dispersion is the variance, which is the average of the square of the deviation from the mean; the square root of the variance is the standard deviation. Further discussions of these measures, together with methods of calculation etc. may be found in most textbooks, e.g. Yule and Kendall (1950), chapters 4, 5 and 6.
Tests of significance are another group of statistical tools of great use in fishery research, as in most other fields. While the explanation of the arithmetical steps involved in any particular test will be left to the appropriate section of the textbooks, e.g. Yule and Kendall (1950), chapter 21, it is worth emphasizing here the underlying basis of tests of significance. That is, we assume some null hypothesis, and on this basis calculate the probability of the observed values occurring. If this probability is sufficiently small (usually one in twenty, or one in a hundred) we reject the null hypothesis. For instance, using the t-test for the difference in the means of two samples, the null hypothesis is that the two samples come from the same population. If the probability of a value of t equal to or greater than that observed occurring is say 0.01, this means that if the two samples had come from the same population, an unlikely event (a one in a hundred chance) has taken
place and we therefore believe that the two samples did not come from the same population, i.e. they are statistically different. Such a test does not give any information on the probability of the two samples coming from different populations, or on the practical significance of the difference. For instance, two small and variable samples may differ by an amount which is not statistically significant, but which if real would be most important. Conversely, for two large and homogeneous samples a difference may be large enough to be statistically significant, but yet so small as to be negligible in practice.
2.3 Sampling

2.3.2 Sampling the landings
2.3.3 Sampling the population
(For further details see FAO. Manual of sampling and statistical methods for fisheries biology, by J.A. Gulland. Part 1. Sampling methods. Rome, 1966.)
2.3.1 General
Most of the quantities involved in fish population work cannot be obtained or measured throughout the whole population; e.g. it is virtually impossible to measure all fish caught, even less all the fish in the sea. A section, or sample, of the whole population is therefore examined for the attributes concerned, e.g. percentage of mature fish, or average size. On the assumption that this sample is representative of the whole population, an estimate may be made of the true value in the population. If the sampling system used is a good one, then the estimate obtained will differ little from the true value. The merits or otherwise of a sampling system can therefore be measured by two quantities relating to the estimates obtained (those measures refer not to any individual estimate, but to the set of estimates which might be obtained by repeated samples); firstly, the variance, which as defined above for any statistical distribution, is the measure of the scatter of the estimates
about their mean value; secondly, the bias, which is the extent to which the mean value of the set of possible estimates differs from the true value. (The term bias is also used for the processes leading to this difference.)
Because when a bias exists, it exists in all samples, tending to make the estimates constantly greater (or less) than the true value, it cannot be detected as a difference between repeated samples; thus in general bias is very difficult to detect, and hence eliminate, in subsequent analysis. A large variance, in contrast, appears at once in the differences between samples. Large bias is therefore even less desirable than large variance, in that it may cause what appear to be reliable and consistent data to give results that are consistent only in the extent to which they are wrong.
The basic feature of any good sampling system is a " random" sample. The aim of a random sample should be to ensure that all members of the collection of objects being sampled have the same chance of occurring in the sample. In practice this condition may be relaxed and the sampling be nonrandom so long as there is no relation between the chance of occurring in the sample, and the value of the attribute being measured. For instance, the first fish unloaded from a trawler onto the fish market is usually one of the last caught and will be placed near the edge of the array of fish and therefore have a better chance of appearing in the sample. If we are only concerned with sampling for the size of fish, this may not matter as there is little relation between size of fish and time of capture, but the sample would be a very bad one if we were concerned with the condition or freshness of the fish. The main damage done by nonrandom sampling is this introduction of bias (e.g. that
the sample taken above will be biased toward having too many fresh fish) though nonrandom sampling has other disadvantages, e.g. that many of the calculations used for estimating variance etc. are only valid for random samples. The first concern in taking a sample is therefore to ensure that no form of selection can occur that might cause a bias. Such selection may be very obvious and direct, e.g. the tendency to take the bigger fish from a pile, leaving the smaller until last, but may be much less obvious; e.g. in the East Anglian herring season it would seem convenient to take samples of herring from the first drifters arriving each morning. These tend to be from the nearer grounds, which in turn tend to have slightly different size and age of fish. Thus a nonrandomness in time of sampling may cause a bias in the estimate of average size or age of fish landed.
The practical difficulties in taking a truly random sample from a large and heterogeneous collection of objects are considerable. These difficulties may be overcome by dividing up the whole collection into smaller and more compact sections, within which a random sample may be taken fairly readily. Two such methods of sampling are stratified and two-stage sampling. In stratified sampling the whole collection of objects is divided into several sections, or strata, each of which is then sampled and analysed separately, e.g. landings at different ports may be taken as strata. This method is particularly useful in reducing bias and variance when there is a marked difference between Strata.
2.3.2 Sampling the landings
The chief sampling problem in fish population studies occurs when estimating indices of abundance of the different ages and sizes of fish, and particularly in sampling the commercial catches for size and age composition. Before starting to consider the sampling procedure, the objective of the sampling must be defined, both in extent and the attribute being examined, e.g. length of plaice landed by United Kingdom trawlers from the North sea. Following a stratified sampling scheme the complete population, which will be rather heterogeneous, may then be divided into fairly uniform strata. For United Kingdom demersal landings it was found suitable to treat landings at each port and in each month separately, but for the more variable herring landings, landings in three-day periods were chosen. The first step in the actual sampling procedure is to ensure that the sample taken is not biased. Once the catch of a vessel is sold it may be divided among a number of merchants each of
whom is almost certain to prefer a certain size or quality of fish; therefore any sample from the purchases of one merchant is almost certain to be biased. Sampling of commercial catches must therefore be taken before the catch is divided; in the United Kingdom this means sampling in the early morning while the catch is laid out on the fish market before being auctioned.
The choice of fish to measure is conveniently done in two stages; first a sample of one or more ships from the whole fleet landing during the period, and then measuring a sample of fish from the chosen ship or ships. The choice of ships to sample is usually straightforward and minor departures from nonrandom samples are not very likely to be harmful, but may introduce bias when time of landing or position on the market (which are likely to influence their chance of being sampled) are themselves influenced by the fishing ground, and hence related to the composition of the catch. This difficulty may be overcome by further stratification, sampling and analysing the catches from each area separately.
When taking a sample of fish from a ship's catch an important source of bias is the tendency of most people to take first the largest fish from a pile and to leave the smallest to last. This is especially noticeable when sampling fish on deck, e.g. a haul of a research vessel. At sea this bias can only be overcome by handling all the catch, or at least a predetermined part (e.g. one corner), clearing all the fish right down to deck level. On the market most fish are laid out in boxes (often with the larger fish of the box on top), and bias will be avoided by sampling one or more complete boxes. If there is no definite sorting into two or more categories, systematic differences between boxes are unlikely and a convenient but nonrandom method of sampling, e.g. taking boxes from one edge of the landing, is justifiable. Important in working up the results of such a sampling system are the raising factors, i.e. ratios of weight sampled to total weight landed, both over the whole
landings and within a sampled ship. The procedure is as follows; supposing we are interested in the total number landed of a certain size (or age, maturity, etc.) of fish
Let m = number of ships from which samples were taken and for any particular one of these, say the ith,
W[i] = weight landed
w[i] == weight sampled
n[i] = number of fish of required size in sample
Also if W = total weight landed
and w = weight landed by sampled ships
Frequently fish are sorted into several size categories which may or may not be the same from one ship to the next; then obviously a sample must be taken from each category of the ship examined. The figure for the ship as a whole is then given by raising each category individually by the appropriate raising factor. Thus, supposing there are two categories, using the notation above, and using one or two dashes to distinguish the different categories, we have
and number of fish of given size on the ith sampled ship is
Then the total number landed may be estimated directly as
Alternatively, and rather better, the sorting by categories can be used as stratification through all landings, and raising factors for each category calculated and applied. Then the estimate of the numbers landed is
Where
This second estimate will be more precise (have less variance), as it utilizes the information on the division of all landings between the categories. It can be applied so long as the sorting is constant even if not very accurate, i.e. the number and definition of the categories is constant, even if the dividing line between them is variable.
In population studies we are interested in several characteristics of the fish, e.g. length, weight, age, maturity, most of which are closely related. Some, e.g. lengths, are very easy to determine both quickly and accurately even under the somewhat adverse conditions at sea or on the fish market. Other characteristics, e.g. age, which are considerably more tedious to determine are then most easily determined by sampling directly for length only, and using relatively small age samples to establish an age-length key for converting length composition to age composition. That is, the length sampling gives the number of fish in each length group, and the age samples give the proportion of each age within each length group. The number at each age is then readily given; algebraically if
N[i] = number of fish in ith length group
P[ij] = proportion of fish of age j in ith length group
where
n[i] = number of length i examined for age
n[ij] = number of length i examined which were age j
then
N[i]P[ij] = total number of fish of length i and age j
and
S N[i]P[ij] = total number of fish of age j.
It should be noted that these calculations involve no assumptions concerning the pattern of growth, though the advantages of the method in form of increased accuracy (decreased variance and risk of bias) are greatest when the growth is fast and uniform.
2.3.3 Sampling the population
Data on the composition of the catch are important in themselves, particularly when comparing and combining the effects of two dissimilar fisheries exploiting the same stock; or in making assessments of the immediate effects of, say, a mesh change. In addition, the catch, whether of the commercial fleet or of a research vessel, may also be considered as a sample of the stock. The usual sampling methods are directly applicable, e.g. stratified sampling by dividing the region into fairly uniform subareas, but special problems arise in obtaining unbiased estimates of the abundance and the composition of the stock. The first is a matter of relating stock density to catch per unit effort, and the second of selection in the widest sense, i.e. including any factor making one size (or condition) of fish more likely than another to be caught and retained by the gear, with mesh selection included as a special case. These latter problems will be discussed more fully in the appropriate
later sections.

3.3 Exercises
3.1 Growth by length and weight
For population analysis it is desirable to express the growth of fish in a mathematical expression. The basic requirement is an expression which will give the size (in terms of length or weight) at any given age which agrees with the observed data of size at age, and which is in a mathematical form which can be incorporated reasonably easily in expressions for yield. Strictly, most population analysis is concerned more directly with growth rate, i.e. increase in weight or length per unit time, rather than with the size at various ages, because many problems in fishery assessment are essentially a matter of comparing weight gained by growth against that lost by natural mortality. Sometimes, for instance when considering the effect of an increase in size of first capture, it is particularly important to know the rate of growth over a comparatively short part of the total life span - that is, to know how long it will take a fish to grow from the original size of first capture
to the new. There are therefore good reasons for preferring, other things being equal, a method of fitting equations to growth rate data, rather than simply size at age.
Other desirable features of a growth equation are that the computational work involved in fitting it to observed data should be small, that the number of constants used should be few, that as far as possible these constants should have some biological meaning, and that if extrapolated to ages beyond those used in fitting the equation, the equation should not lead to unreasonable results.
There exists a considerable and growing literature on growth equations, which covers a wide range of possible equations, none of which seems to be entirely satisfactory in all situations. In fact it is most unlikely that a simple formula would always be able to describe the growth of even a single fish through most of its life, in which there could be greatly different conditions of food supply, reproductive strain, etc. These notes do not attempt to give a complete survey of growth equations, but will be mainly concerned with one particular equation, that ascribed to von Bertalanffy (1938), which satisfies the two most important criteria - it fits most of the observed data of fish growth, and can be incorporated readily into stock assessment models.
If the length of a fish, crustacean, or lamellibranch is plotted against age, the result is usually a curve of which the slope continuously de- creases with increasing age, and which approaches an upper asymptote parallel to the X-axis (see Figure 3.1.1). Curves of weight at age also approach an upper asymptote, but usually form an asymmetrical sigmoid, the inflexion occurring at a weight of about one third of the asymptotic weight (see Figure 3.1.2).
FIGURE 3.1.1. - Curve of growth by length.
FIGURE 3.1.2. - Curve of growth by weight.
If the rate of growth in length is plotted against length, the result is often well fitted by a straight line, cutting the X-axis at a point L[¥ ]beyond which the fish will not grow. This is of course the asymptote of the plot of length on age. If the rate of growth in length is linearly related to length, then in mathematical terms
where L[¥ ]is the value of l for which the rate of growth is zero. This equation is in the general form of a straight line relation, y = ax + b, with a = - K, b = K L[¥ ]. To integrate this differential equation, we write it in the form
and therefore - log (L[¥ ]- l) = Kt + constant
or L[¥ ]- l = Kt + constant
or l = L[¥ ]- constant × e^-Kt
Putting t[0] as the theoretical age at which l = 0 we can obtain the value of the constant from the relation
then
Equation (3.1) is identical with that deduced by von Bertalanffy (1938) on physiological grounds. He considered that growth in weight was the resultant of the difference between anabolic and katabolic factors, taken as proportional to surface area and weight respectively
or, putting w µ l^3, s µ l^2
For data at equal time intervals of length T, from equation (3.2)
l[t+T] - l[T] = (L[¥ ]- l[t])(1 - e^-KT) ............. (3.3)
The plot of increment l[t+T] - l[T], against initial length, l[t], therefore gives a line, slope - (1 - e^-KT), and an intercept, on the X-axis, of L[¥ ](see Figure 3.2.1). The important special curve is T = 1 year, when the slope = - (1 - e^-K). An alternative form of equation (3.3) is
l[t+T] - l[T] = L[¥ ](1 - e^-KT) + l[t]e^-KT ..............(3.4)
which, for T = 1, is the well-known Ford-Walford plot, of l[t+i] against l[t], which gives a straight line, slope e^-K, and an intercept on the 45° line, where l[t] = l[t+][1], of L[¥ ](see Figure 3.2.2). This plot is essentially the same as the plot of increment (l[t+1] - l[t]) against initial length. The points will seem to fit the Ford-Walford line better, but because the intersection of the regression line and the 45° line is very oblique, L[¥ ]is in fact estimated with equal precision by the two plots, and if the fitting is done graphically rather than by calculating regression lines, e.g. by least squares, greater errors in drawing are likely to be introduced in the plot of l[t+1] against l[t].
FIGURE 3.2.1. - Estimation of growth constants. Plot of length increment against initial length.
FIGURE 3.2.2. - Plot of length against length one year earlier (Ford-Walford plot).
L[¥ ]and K can be determined directly from the lines fitted to these plots either by regression analysis, or by eye; then t[0] can be estimated from equation (3.2) for any particular observation of length at age. For this, equation (3.2) is best rewritten as
or
While an estimate of t[0] can be thus obtained for each age for which the mean length is known, these estimates will not be equally good. Those from old fish will be highly variable, because a small difference in l[t] makes a big difference to the estimate of t[0] when l[t] is nearly equal to L[¥ ], while the mean length of the youngest fish may be biased because only the bigger fish of these ages appear in the catches. The best estimate of t[0] would appear to be the mean of the estimates of t[0] obtained from the younger, but fully recruited, age groups.
Data on length at annual intervals can be obtained and tabulated in various ways. Probably the most straightforward is the analysis of the growth of a single fish - the length at the end of each year of life being obtained from measurements along an axis of a scale, otolith or other hard structure. Alternatively, the growth of a single year-class can be followed over a period of years - i.e. for the 1956 year-class the increment in the fifth year of life is the difference between the mean length of five-year-old fish at the end of 1961 and four-year-old fish at the end of 1960. Both these methods are concerned with the growth of a group of fish during their life, the growth during each year of life providing one point in the plot. Thus the growth increments refer to different calendar years; for example for the 1956 year-class the increment in the third year of life is put on in 1959, possibly under conditions very different to those in 1961, the fifth year of life. Growth
in a particular year can be studied by taking the growth of different year-classes - e.g. data of growth in 1960 are given by the growth of the 1956 year-class in its fifth year of life, of the 1957 year-class in its fourth year of life - each year-class provides one point in the plot. This is a particularly useful method for studying the effect of the environment - food, temperature, density, etc. on growth. Finally, growth can be estimated from a single year's data, e.g. from data in 1960 the increment in the fifth year of life can be estimated from the difference in lengths of the 1955 and 1956 year-classes, the fourth year's increment from the difference between the 1956 and 1957 year-classes, etc. These differences do not, in fact, correspond to the growth of any particular fish or group of fish, and the method should be used only when other methods cannot. An improvement is to take the average size at each age over a number of years, but in this case it is usually
possible, and more satisfactory, to analyse the growth of the individual year-classes or in each calendar year.
The weight of a fish is usually closely proportional to the cube of its length, so that from equation (3.2)
where W[¥ ]is the asymptotic weight corresponding to the asymptotic length L[¥ ].
When growth data are given in terms of weight, fitting of growth curves is most easily done by using the cube-root of the weight as an index of length, fitting this to the equations of growth in length as above, and finally cubing to return to weight.
A more general growth equation has been given by Richards (1959); with a slight change from his notation this is
and for m = 0, the monomolecular equation
w[t] = W[¥ ](1 - ae^-kt)
and it can be shown that in the limit as m ® 1, the equation becomes the Gompertz log w[t] = log W[¥ ](1 - ae^-Kt). This curve satisfies a relation similar to that of equation (3.1), only in terms of log length rather than length, i.e.
3.2 Conversion of length to age
The expressions above give the weight or length of a fish in terms of its age. Sometimes, the inverse procedure is required, i.e. it is desired to know the age of fish of a given length, e.g. selection data are normally in terms of length, but for incorporation in yield equations need to be expressed in terms of age.
If the seasonal growth pattern is very marked, and all fish of a particular age are nearly the same length, the actual mean age of fish of a given length may be quite different from the mean age determined from the average annual growth curve, particularly at the beginning and end of the season of rapid growth. If this is the case, the conversion of length to age is best made empirically from the observed age-length curve. Also, particularly if there is much individual variation in growth, the curve of mean length at a given age will be different from the curve of mean age at a given length (just as generally the regression line of y on x is different from the regression line of x on y). Usually, however, it is sufficient to convert length to age from a growth equation fitted to all the observed data of mean length at age, e.g. the von Bertalanffy equation
To obtain t in terms of l we divide both sides by L[¥ ], and subtract from unity, giving
Taking natural logs of both sides gives
and therefore
The span of age t[2] - t[1] between two lengths l[1], l[2] is therefore
3.3 Exercises
1. The von Bertalanffy growth equation contains three parameters (L[¥ ], K and t[0]), which can therefore be estimated from three observations of length at age. From equation (3.2) write down the lengths at times t - 1, t, t + 1, and the increments in length between t - 1 and t and between t and t + 1. Hence determine an estimate for K from the ratio of these increments; by substituting this estimate for K in equation (3.2), or otherwise, find an estimate for L[¥ ], in terms of l[t] and the increments.

4.5 Distribution of fishing
4.6 Several gears
4.7 Exercises
4.1 Introduction
These two quantities may be conveniently treated together. Both provide indices related to important quantities - the fishing mortality and the density of the exploited stock. If the total catch is known (as it generally is), then if either effort or catch per unit effort is known the other can be calculated at once. Though catch per unit effort is usually a derived quantity obtained from the independent values of catch and effort, these data need not relate to an entire fishery and in practice the catch per unit is often obtained from data from some part of a whole fishery, and the total effort is estimated from it.
A distinction must be made between the use of effort data to study the stocks of fish, as described in this manual, and the use of data on the amount of fishing to study the input of the fishery in economic terms. Over a short period both may be measured by the same set of figures, say days at sea, but if there are technical improvements in the fishery then the statistics of the amount of fishing should be adjusted in different ways. For instance, suppose the introduction of sonar equipment doubles the fishing power, and hence on the average doubles the catch per day of a purse-seiner. Then to the biologist the effort exerted per day fishing has doubled, and the statistics of days fishing should be adjusted accordingly; to the economist the input is increased only slightly, to allow for the cost of the sonar equipment.
Though the catch per unit effort will rarely be exactly proportional to the stock density, it is often essential to have some measure of the stock, and the catch per unit will nearly always be the best available - better than for example, total catch. As research into the fishery develops, requiring better indices of stock magnitude so, in general will the measure of catch per effort become better, being refined by taking into account the spatial distribution of fishing, differences in the fishing power of vessels, etc.
In some situations a satisfactory measure of stock density (and hence an index of catch per unit effort) can be obtained quite independently of catch and effort data. This index can then be used, by dividing into the figure of the total catch, to provide an index of total effort. For instance, recent developments in surveying techniques using sonar and echo-sounding suggest that for some pelagic fisheries, in which normal catch and effort data are often difficult to interpret, the most reliable index of density will be derived from echo- or sonar-survey data, expressed say, as so much trace per mile steamed. The corresponding index of effort is then the catch divided by the index of density, i.e. tons caught per unit trace.
4.2 The mathematical formulation
The relations between catch, effort and stock density are clear for the operations of a single unit on a uniform density of fish, e.g. a trawl which may be considered as taking at each haul a fixed proportion of the fish present. Then the catch per operation is proportional to the stock density, and the number of operations is proportional to the mortality caused.
Mathematically, if the catch of one operation is proportional to the stock density
D C = q · D f · N/A ....................(4.1)
where D C = catch of one operation
q = constant
D f = fishing effort exerted by unit operation
N = mean stock abundance
A = area inhabited by the stock
The catch, in numbers, is equal to the number of deaths due to fishing, which, in the following section, will be shown to be written conveniently in terms of instantaneous rates
where F == fishing mortality coefficient
or, in terms of short intervals
D C = - (D N) fishing = FN D t
Therefore,
q D f · N/A = FN D f................... (4.2)
and
i.e., the fishing mortality coefficient is proportional to the fishing intensity, where the fishing intensity is defined as the fishing effort per unit area, per unit time.
This may be written
and if q and A are constant, adding up over a period length t
where f is the total fishing effort during the period or
F = q
F = q · ^f/At ....................... (4.3)
== q × fishing intensity
In practice A, the area inhabited by the stock will be constant, and over a fixed time period, say one year, we can write
F = q' f .........................(4.4)
where q' = constant, and this is the form in which the relation between fishing mortality and fishing effort is usually expressed.
The basic equation (4.1) for the single operation can be written in terms of catch per unit effort
or, again assuming q and A are constant, averaging over a period
These calculations, which express for all the operations during some period the fishing effort as an index of mortality or the catch per unit effort as an index of density, require that all the operations are expressed in standard units, i.e. that the constant q in equation (4.1) should be the same for all operations. A simple form of operation is a day at sea of a single boat, so that a simple measure of effort is the number of days at sea, and of catch per unit effort, the catch per day at sea. In attempting to improve this simple measure, we are concerned with how, during an average day at sea a greater or lesser proportion of the stock can be caught. As usual, small short-term fluctuations are generally irrelevant for the purposes of this manual, the important factors being those causing long-term trends.
The catch per day at sea of a ship can be increased for a given stock density:
(a) Because during actual fishing time more fish are caught (the fishing power of the ship is increased).
(b) Because more actual fishing time is spent per day; in addition, since the distribution of a stock is never completely uniform, but there are local concentrations of higher density than the average, another possibility is
(c) Because the ship operates in local areas of greater density.
Standardization of fishing effort data therefore depends on determining whether there are appreciable variations (especially trends) in effective fishing time, fishing power, or distribution of the fleet, and if so making the necessary standardization of the appropriate component of the total fishing effort. The precise method of standardization is best determined after the changes, or likely changes have been identified. For instance, for trawlers it is well known that the fishing power increases with both size (tonnage) and horsepower. If the composition of a trawler fleet does not change, even though there are both large and small vessels, then there is no immediate need to standardize. But if there are changes, and the average sizes, or power of the ships increase, then some standardization must be done. If the change is a matter of new ships being built which are both bigger and more powerful, then the standardization might be in terms either of tonnage, or horsepower
(or possibly some other index of size or power) whichever is most convenient. If the changes are a matter of putting bigger engines into existing vessels, then standardization must be in terms of horsepower (or other index of engine size).
4.3 Fishing time
Standardization of fishing time may be approached by subtracting from the basic data of days at sea the periods which are not directly occupied with catching or locating fish. These include:
(a) Time lost through bad weather.
(b) Time steaming to and from the fishing grounds.
(c) Time during which the gear is being prepared for fishing, but is not actually in operation.
(d) Time spent handling the catch, after it has been caught.
The proportions that these elements of the nonproductive time form of the total time at sea will vary for various reasons. Bad weather may be expected to fluctuate randomly, and may often be ignored, but bigger or better designed vessels may be able to fish in worse conditions and therefore lose less time.
Steaming time will be reduced by the use of faster vessels, but may increase as the nearer grounds are depleted, and the ships have to go further afield (in this case catch per day on the grounds might provide the better index of fish density on the grounds fished, but catch per day at sea a better index of general stock abundance).
Changes in the time lost handling the gear or the catch may be important, especially when correlated with stock abundance. At high levels of stock much time may be lost handling the catch, or in making only short trawl hauls (with proportionately much less time with the gear on the bottom), so that changes in the catch per day on the grounds (or day fishing) will tend to underestimate changes in the stock density.
The productive time will include:
(a) Time on the fishing grounds, searching for fish, and
(b) Time when the gear is in operation, catching fish.
The relative importance of these two aspects of fishing time will depend on the type of gear. At one extreme is whaling, where the gear (harpoon) is only in operation for a very short time, and the important measure is the time spent searching for whales. At the other extreme, bottom trawlers spend little time searching and the important measure is the time for which the gear is on the bottom, catching fish. For some gear, e.g. purse-seines, it may not be clear which measure, fishing time or searching time, or combination of both, should be used, and for these gears it may be best to take as the basic unit of fishing time the time on the grounds (expressed as days or hours). Such statistics should then be supplemented by detailed log-book records (possibly for only a sample of the fleet) on how the total time on the grounds is spent - searching, preparing the gear, actual catching, handling the catch - with the expectation that later analysis and a fuller understanding of
how the fishery operates may help to derive a better index of fishing time.
For some gear, e.g. long-lines, gill-nets, which, like trawls, catch more or less continuously, the efficiency of operations changes with changing duration of the operation. Thus a long-line set for twelve hours may catch more than one set for six hours, but not twice as much. This effect may be considered as a change in fishing power, or in effective fishing time, but the relevant information is best collected in terms of fishing time. If the average duration of set is unchanged, the effect may not be important, though in some fisheries the extent of the effect depends on the abundance of the stock; thus an extreme example is a scallop dredge, which may in some fisheries fill up and cease to catch any more after perhaps twenty minutes, even though towing is continued for half an hour or more. Fishing time for such gears is then best collected in a convenient form (say number of sets), and an adjustment made for any change in the average duration of set, or for any effect of
gear saturation.
4.4 Fishing power
The fishing power of a particular gear, i.e. the catch it takes from a given density of fish per unit fishing time (in the units of fishing time appropriate to that gear), can be thought of in two parts
(a) The extent (area or volume of water) over which the influence of the gear extends, and within which fish are liable to be caught (= a say).
(b) The proportion of the fish within this area which are in fact caught (= p say).
Clearly if fish or fishing were randomly distributed, then the proportion of the total stock within the area of influence would be ^a/A, and the catch would be ^pa/A × N. That is, the product p × ^a/A would give a direct measure of the fishing mortality (see section 5.3).
Improvements to fishing techniques can affect either quantity. For instance, for purse-seiners the area of influence can be increased by better searching - faster ships, use of advanced detection equipment etc. - while the proportion of the population in this area that can be taken may be increased by the use of a larger net, or by some of the sonar equipment.
Changes in fishing power are least important in stationary gears, traps, lines, etc., where the basic unit of gear - the single lobster pot, or the baited hook - does not change much, and the fishing power of the individual vessel is increased by carrying more pots, or using more hooks. The effort can therefore be readily expressed in standard terms as number of pots, or number of hooks, etc. multiplied by a suitable measure of fishing time (which will often be one operation, adjusted if necessary to a standard duration of operation).
The fishing power of the more active gears - trawls, purse-seiners, etc. - are more likely to change with improvements in the vessel or gear. For instance the average size of United Kingdom trawlers fishing at Iceland has almost doubled during the past thirty years, and probably also the size of net has increased, though the data on the details of the gear used are not as good as the vessel data. In this fishery, and in some other trawl fisheries analysed in detail, the fishing power has been shown to be closely proportional to the gross tonnage of the trawler or to the horse power of the engine. Tonnage or horse power is therefore a convenient index of fishing power, and fishing effort data may be expressed in standard terms such as ton-hours (i.e. hours fishing times average tonnage of the vessels).
For purse-seiners also large vessels catch more than small vessels, but the catch goes up less than proportionately to tonnage. Thus for the United States tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific correction factors have been used for each size category of vessel to adjust their effort to that of vessels between 100 and 200 tons; these factors ranged from 0.60 for vessels less than 50 tons to 1.37 for vessels over 200 tons.
For this type of gear, it is best, if there have been appreciable changes in the fleet during the period of study, to take one vessel, or group of vessels as standard, and determine from catch records the fishing power of other vessels, or group of vessels, relative to the standard vessel. The fishing effort for the fleet as a whole can then be expressed in standard terms.
4.5 Distribution of fishing
When the fishing power and fishing time have been fully standardized, the resulting catch per unit effort will be proportional to the average density at the positions fished, the average being weighted according to the amount of fishing at each place. This average density will almost certainly be greater than the true average density, because most fishing will be done on the grounds giving good catches. The catch per unit effort will, however, still be a valid index of the density so long as the ratio of the true density to the density weighted by the amount of fishing remains constant. The difference between the true average density and the average density taken over the positions fished may be considered in two parts, corresponding to fishing tactics - getting the best catch on a particular ground - and fishing strategy - making the best choice of grounds taking into account such things as different steaming time to different grounds, the different species composition on
the grounds, and the different prices for different species, etc. On any given fishing ground, which for the North sea trawl fisheries may be thought of as say ten miles across, the distribution of fishing will be determined solely by the fishermen's ability to find the small local concentrations of fish. The density in the unfished parts of the fishing ground will be unknown, but the ratio of the density in the fished areas to the average density will generally be constant, at least over a short period. Over a longer period the introduction of new devices may permit the fishermen to concentrate more effectively on the fish, either directly (echo sounding) or by more accurate navigation (e.g. Decca, radar or echo sounding). These improvements may be most easily considered and analysed as changes in the fishing power of the fishing unit (vessel, plus fishing gear plus other gear). To the first approximation, though, we may write, for any one fishing ground, from equation
where C == catch, f = effort
q, q^1 are constants
D = true average density on that ground
A unit stock will usually be distributed over several fishing grounds and the ratio of total catch to total effort will be equal to the weighted mean of the catches per unit effort in the various grounds, weighted by the effort on each ground, i.e.
where C, f are the total catch and effort, and C[i], f[i] the catch and effort in a particular fishing ground.
Since the distribution of fishing is likely to vary from year to year due to changes in the relative abundance of different stocks, etc., these weighting factors will vary, and the ratio of the total catch per unit effort to stock abundance will also vary (unless the density of fish on all grounds is the same).
However, from equation (4.6) we can for any fishing ground, i, whose area is A[i] say, express the number of fish as
If the whole range of the stock can be subdivided into regions, within each of which equation (4.6) can be applied, then by adding, the total number in the stock is
If q[i] is constant = q for all grounds, then
where
A == S A[i]
i.e. the density is the weighted mean of the catches per unit effort in each subregion, the weighting factors being the areas of the regions. If all the areas are of equal size, this reduces to
The effective total effort (that is, the measure of effort which will remain proportional to the fishing mortality regardless of changes in the distribution of fish and fishing) can be derived from equation (4.7) by dividing into the total catch, i.e.
These formulae also allow density indices to be obtained for any particular subgroup of the population, e.g. an age group. If the density index for the entire population is given by total catch divided by total effort, then the index for a given age group is found by dividing the number landed of that age group (see section on sampling) by the total effort. Otherwise the index is obtained by raising the number of each age in a unit weight by the weight caught per unit effort. If there are marked differences in composition between different regions of the stock then the density indices will have to be obtained for each region separately, and the index for the whole stock obtained by weighting up by the areas of each region. The size of these regions should be small enough to ensure uniform composition within them, but in general should be larger than the separate grounds, which, as discussed earlier, are used in giving the overall density index.
The analysis of catch and effort data by small areas is particularly valuable when more than one species is being exploited, each species living in slightly different, but perhaps overlapping, parts of the whole fishing region. The proportion of a given species in the catch will therefore, depend as much on where the catch was made, as on the abundance of that species. Within a sufficiently small subarea, however, the proportion of a given species in the catch will be more nearly constant, and unaffected by the precise fishing position.
Another method of analysing fishing effort data on mixed species is possible when any one landing can be allocated according to the species which was the main objective of that trip - for example German trawlers fishing at west Greenland land during the year roughly equal quantities of cod and redfish, any one landing however usually consists predominantly of cod or of redfish. The stock density of cod will then be estimated from the catch per unit effort of those trawlers fishing specifically for cod, and the density of redfish from the catches of those fishing for redfish. (Another method is discussed by Ketchen in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, 1964 b.)
4.6 Several gears
When more than one group of vessels is exploiting a unit stock - e.g. otter trawlers and longliners, or vessels from several countries - it will usually be difficult or impossible to express the effort statistics from all vessels in the same units, and thus to obtain directly a figure for total effort. One single fleet (A) may therefore be taken as standard, and its catch per unit effort taken as the best index of density, and total effort estimated as
Total effort =
If reasonable effort statistics are available from more than one fleet it is best first to calculate catch per unit effort figures for each fleet separately, and then compare the year-to-year changes in the indices of abundance thus obtained. If each separate index follows much the same trend, then this is some confirmation that each is a fair measure of the abundance (the degree of confirmation increases with the diversity of the fleets concerned, e.g. it is more encouraging if data from trawlers and long-liners agree, than if two trawl fleets agree). Conversely, if there is a discrepancy between two sets of catch per unit effort figures, then one, and possibly both, is not a good measure of abundance. Before using either set of data the methods of obtaining them must be examined to see where the discrepancy might arise (e.g. one fleet has included an increasing number of new and powerful vessels, not taken account of in the effort statistics used). If two or more fleets
give consistent indices of catch per unit effort, then a single pooled index of catch per unit effort (and hence of total effort) can be conveniently obtained by expressing the index for each fleet as a percentage of some standard year, or period of years.

5.6 Exercises
5.1 Introduction
When studying mortalities we are concerned with rates of change, and it is generally most convenient to deal with instantaneous rates of change (see section 1); that is, the rate at which the numbers in the population are decreasing can be written as
where Z is defined as the instantaneous total mortality coefficient. From this equation the number N[t] alive at any time will be given by (see section 2.4.1, exercise No. 18).
N[t] = N[0]e-^Zt
where N[0] = number alive at time = 0.
Often we are concerned with considering separately two causes of removal from the population - natural deaths (disease, predation, etc.) and fish caught; then we can write
where M = natural mortality coefficient
where F = fishing mortality coefficient
then in a very short time interval dt, the deaths due to fishing will be equal to FNdt, natural deaths MNdt, and total deaths ZNdt, therefore
F + M = Z
i.e. instantaneous mortality coefficients are additive.
5.2 Estimation of total mortality
or
This has the obvious special case where t = one year. The same formulae also hold when the true abundances are not known, but indices of them, e.g. catches per unit effort, are available, i.e. number n[0], n[1] proportional to N[0], N[1] then
Often abundances, or indices of abundance, will not be known at any particular exact time, but only as averages over finite periods of time, e.g. a year. In terms of the abundance at the beginning of the period, N, and the total mortality coefficient, Z, the average abundance during the period, duration T, may be denoted by N; the numbers alive at time t are Ne^-Zt so that
If we denote by appropriate suffixes the values of numbers and mortalities during periods 0 and 1, of duration T, starting a year apart we have
Taking the ratio of the average abundances, we have
If Z[0] = Z[1] = Z, then equation (5.2) reduces to
i.e. the ratio of the mean abundance can be used in the same manner as the ratio of instantaneous abundances in equation (5.1).
The formulae above will usually be applied to the abundances of individual year-classes and enable estimates to be made of the mortalities between any pair of successive years and for any fully recruited year-class. These estimates are likely to be quite numerous, and the question then arises as to how the "best" combined estimate of mortality can be obtained. A single combined estimate is only valid if there are no systematic differences in mortality, either with age or time, over the period considered; these may be most easily detected from an array such as Table 5.1, either by inspection of the means of rows and columns, or more rigorously by a statistical test, such as the analysis of variance.
The entries in such a table should always be in the form of instantaneous coefficients, not percentage mortalities, as it is easy to show that the latter are biased, being underestimated by an average amount depending on the variance of the data, and that this bias may be quite appreciable when taking the mean of several estimates. This bias is due to the numerator in equation (5.1) being not known exactly; the overestimate of the survival when the numerator is too low is greater than the underestimate when the numerator is, to the same extent, too high. A similar bias may be seen in comparing the mean of the reciprocals of a set of numbers, which is not the same as the reciprocal of their mean.

Age
Year
Mean
Mean
If there are no appreciable systematic differences between years or ages, then the entries in Table 5.1 can be considered as separate estimates of the same true mortality, and the combined estimate with least variance will be given by taking the weighted mean, with weights inversely proportional to the variances of the individual estimates. These variances will generally be unknown and though obviously the variance for the very old and scarce age groups will be high, the present evidence (on limited data for plaice, herring and haddock) suggests that the variance is about constant for all the well-represented age groups (from four to eleven years for the North sea plaice). Thus, if the data for the older groups are combined (e.g. the last column of Table 5.1), all the variances will be nearly equal, and the appropriate overall estimate will be the simple mean of all the individual estimates. The mean estimate for the mortality between any one pair of age groups in all years
may be determined in the same way, i.e. taking the simple mean of the estimates of Z for each pair of years, or taking the weighted mean, giving greater weight to those years for which the variance of Z is likely to be small (e.g. years in which more samples were taken). Another common method for estimating the mortality between successive years is to take the decrease in the total numbers of all fully exploited year-classes, the ratio of four years and older to five years and older. This is effectively weighting the estimates in Table 5.1 by the numbers of fish at each age.
The effect of using poor figures for effort and catch per unit effort, such that the latter does not bear a constant ratio to the true abundance, may be deduced from equation (5.1). Suppose the relation between catch per unit effort and abundance in the two years is given, with the obvious notation, by
Then
and
then
Thus the estimated mortalities will include an extra term, equal to the logarithm of the change in q (the "availability" or "catchability coefficient"). A change in q will show, in an array such as Table 5.1, as a year-to-year change in mortality unconnected with changes in fishing or other causes of mortality.
Changes in availability are particularly likely to cause serious errors when there is any trend in the values of q. This may be unlikely when using annual figures, but it is often tempting to use the decline in catch per unit effort (either of a single age group or of the stock as a whole) during part of the year to provide an estimate of mortality. Nearly all fisheries show more or less pronounced seasonal changes in catch per unit effort, but while in some fisheries the fluctuations in catches per unit effort may follow precisely the fluctuations in abundance - the increases being due to recruitment and growth, and the decreases due solely to mortality - very often the major causes of the fluctuations are "availability" changes, with the fish being particularly vulnerable to capture at certain seasons, e.g. when concentrated for spawning (similar fluctuations over a 24-hour cycle may often be observed, when there is no question that the decrease during, say, daylight, is
due to the stock abundance really being lower).
As a general rule, therefore, short-term changes in catch per unit effort should not be used in estimating mortalities. Normally mortalities will be estimated from mean annual values, or from periods twelve months apart. Special techniques may be necessary to estimate indices of abundance and hence mortalities, for highly seasonal fisheries where the precise timing of the peak of the season may be different in different years.
Catch per unit effort, or even percentage age data, can be used as indices of abundance directly in the equation, for the coefficient q, related to availability, in the top and bottom of the ratio, relates to the same period, and therefore cancels out, namely
Equations (5.3) and (5.5) are very similar, both containing a term additional to the true mortality. Ratios of catch per unit effort of the same year-class, i.e. equation (5.3), are best to use when year-class strength is variable, or when "availability" changes are small and effort is readily measured. Equation (5.5) is better when measurement of effort is difficult, or year-class variation is small, and also when data are available only for isolated years. A disadvantage of equation (5.5) is that it does not measure the contemporary situation - the additional mortality undergone by the older of two adjacent age groups is that which it underwent during its first year in the fishery and later mortalities have been applied to both year-classes equally. Thus if fish recruit to the fishery at three years old, the ratio of six- to seven-year-old fish in the 1965 catches provides a measure of the mortality in 1961 (the year before the fish, now six years old, recruited to the
fishery).
Estimates of total mortality over a period can also be obtained by semigraphical methods. If Z (the total mortality) is constant we can give the numbers of a year-class at any time, t, after it is subject to the full mortality, as
N[t ]=N[0]e^-Zt
where
N[0] = numbers at time t = 0
therefore log[e]N[t] = log[e] N[0] - Zt.
If now log[e]N[t] is plotted against t, it will give a straight line of slope - Z. This plot can be made either for the catch per unit of a single year-class at different times, in which case deviations (other than sampling variance) will be caused by changes in "availability," or for numbers of different year-classes at the same time - the well-known "catch-curve." (A detailed analysis of such curves, including the interpretation of nonlinear catch-curves is given by Ricker, 1958.) Deviations will be caused in the catch-curve by inequalities in original year-class strength, but the value of the "availability" in the year of sampling will alter only the position of the curve, and not its slope, or the scatter of the points. This graphical method can also (and probably most easily) be used by plotting N[t] against t on semilogarithmic paper. This should give a straight line, from which the mortality is best estimated as follows. Note where the line has some convenient value
FIGURE 5.1. - Estimation of Z. Plot of logarithm of abundance of a year-class against age.
All the above methods, when applied to age composition of catches, are subject to bias when the different ages are not equally vulnerable to the gear used. If the vulnerabilities of successive ages, t, t + 1 are [t]q, [t+][1]q, the catches, or catches per unit effort, are given by
In practice this type of bias may be difficult to detect, unless there are abrupt changes with age, when the apparent mortality will also change with age, though the possibility of its existence should never be neglected. Because such differential vulnerability by age implies that fishing mortality is different for each age, the forms of the age distribution of the stock and of the age distribution of the catch may both be quite different from the simple constant mortality form (see Jones, 1964). Sometimes, e.g. when decreased vulnerability is balanced by decreased mortality, the age distribution of the catches may be very similar to that obtained with constant mortality.
Total mortality can also be estimated from the "virtual population." The virtual population of a certain year-class on say its eighth birthday is the total number of fish of that year-class caught after their eighth birthday.
The mortality during the ninth year of life is then obtained as the logarithm of the ratio of the virtual populations at nine and at eight years old. The method is probably most useful for long-lived fish, of which fishing takes a major share, but for which " availability" varies and is difficult to measure (see Fry, 1957; Bishop, 1959; Garrod, 1967).
When the age composition is not known, estimates, and sometimes quite good estimates, of total mortality can be obtained from length data. The relative number of fish in two different size groups will depend on (a) the time taken to grow from one size to the other, (b) the mortality rate during that period, and (c) the time taken to grow through each size group, i.e. the proportion each size group is of a complete year-class. These factors have one particularly simple case if there is a range of sizes over which the growth is linear, or approximately so. Then if the numbers in each size group are plotted on a logarithmic scale, as for a catch-curve, the plot should yield a straight line, whose slope is proportional to the total mortality coefficient. Further, if the growth rate is known, the absolute value of the mortality can be determined. The curve of growth in weight is generally more closely linear over a wider range of important sizes than is growth in length.
where K, L[¥ ]are the constants in the von Bertalanffy equation.
5.3 Fishing mortality
There are numerous methods for estimating the fishing mortality, none of which is entirely satisfactory, and in practice it is advisable to obtain estimates from as many independent methods as possible. The main methods are outlined here, dealing first with the more direct ones.
(a) Direct census. If the total stock is known, the fishing mortality can be calculated at once from the catch. The total numbers may be obtained by a complete or sample count, e.g. salmon passing upstream, or whales seen in a known area; usually, the only practicable method for marine fishes is the census of adult females by counting (by a suitable plankton survey) the number of eggs produced. The total numbers are then estimated from the proportion of adult females in the catch and their fecundity. An advantage is that it is rather easier than with most other methods to attach statistical confidence limits to the estimates, though these may be wide (see English, 1964).
This method is, of course, confined to gear for which the area covered can be readily estimated, e.g. for a trawl haul the area covered would appear to be the distance between the doors times the distance covered. There are two important sources of error, acting in opposite directions. First, since some of the fish in the area covered by the gear may escape, the method may over-estimate the mortality. Secondly, as mentioned in the section on effort, the density of fish in the fished area will be greater than the average density, leading to an underestimate of the fishing mortality. The method therefore cannot give an exact estimate of fishing mortality, but may sometimes be useful to give an indication of its order of magnitude. In particular, it is often useful in showing whether fishing is likely to be having a significant effect. The method may also be used where the area covered by fish can be determined from an echo survey. (For uses of echo sounders, etc. in measuring
abundance, and hence fishing mortality, see International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, 1964b, Symposium on the Measurement of the Abundance of Fish Stocks, especially papers by Cushing and Federov, and FAO, Report of ACMRR Working Party on Direct and Speedier Estimation of Fish Abundance, 1967.)
(c) Marking. Marking experiments are, of course, one of the best known methods of estimating the fishing mortality. If the population of marked fish is in all ways the same as the total stock, the fishing and total mortalities are readily determined from the number of marked fish returned. The methods are discussed in the next section.
(d) Changes in total mortality. If the amount of fishing changes, thus changing the fishing mortality, this will result in a change in total mortality. Thus if observed changes in the latter can be related quantitatively to known changes in fishing effort, the value of the fishing mortality coefficient at any given level of effort can be deduced. Mathematically, we have for a period of duration, T,
ZT = (F + M) T = qf + M,
where f is the total effort during the period.
If T = 1, then, using the data of effort during one year
Z = F + M = qf + M .................. (5.6)
If a series of pairs of values of f (fishing effort) and Z (total mortality coefficient) are known, equation (5.6) gives a linear relation between them. For two such pairs this gives two simultaneous equations which can be solved for q and M. For more than two pairs the plot of Z against f should yield a straight line, slope q, and intercept on the y-axis M (see Figure 5.2).
FIGURE 5.2. - Estimation of F and M. Plot of mortality coefficient against fishing effort.
The solution for q and M can be obtained by the normal regression techniques of statistics, for equation (5.6) is in the standard form for a linear regression
y = a + bx
where y = total mortality coefficient: x = fishing effort.
The correlation coefficient, the significance level of the regression, and the confidence limits of M and q can be calculated by the standard techniques.
(Paloheimo, 1961).
This method, though most obviously used for effort varying with time, i.e. from year to year, can also be applied when the fishing effort varies with age, supposing that a selective gear is in commercial use, but that true density indices of each age group can be obtained, e.g. by special research vessel sampling.
When the estimates of mortality between successive pairs of years are highly variable, because of sampling errors or other causes (e.g. changes in "availability") rather than real changes in mortality, an average mortality coefficient over several years can be obtained by following the fortunes of a single year-class throughout its life in the exploited phase. If its density index is plotted on a logarithmic scale this should yield a straight line, slope equal to the mortality coefficient, and this last can be plotted against the average fishing effort in the corresponding period. Though this method gains in reducing the scatter, this is at the cost of losing information on the effect of year-to-year changes, though not of long-term trends, in fishing effort. Also, since the data for adjacent year classes come to a large extent from the same years, the points are not fully independent, and the exact tests of significance and confidence levels, outlined above, also cannot be
applied.
5.4 Natural mortality and growth characters
An idea of the value of the natural mortality rate can be gauged from the growth pattern of the species concerned. A fish which approaches its ultimate length quickly - i.e. has a high value of K - is likely to have a high natural mortality, whereas a fish that grows slowly (a low K) is likely also to have a low M. The relation between M and K appears to differ from one group of fish to another - thus for clupeoids M is generally between one and two times K; for gadiforms M is generally between two and three times K. Like the swept area method for estimating fishing mortality this is not a precise method, but is often most useful in the early stages of studying a fishery in judging whether natural (or fishing) mortality is likely to be the dominant element in the total mortality (Beverton and Holt, 1959).
5.5 Special graphical methods
Graphical methods can also be used to estimate mortality rates from some other special situations where algebraic methods would be difficult. Regier (1962) has described some such situations where census data giving the stock in absolute numbers at different times are available and also statistics of total catch, either during a very short season (perhaps only a few days, so that fishing mortality is extremely high) or during a season covering only a part of the period between the two census dates.
FIGURE 5.3. - Graphical method for determining mortality rate.
Consider first a very short fishing season, during which 300 fish are caught in, say, two days. At some time, t[0], before the season say 1 000 fish were present, and at some time t[2] after the season say 300 fish were present. Using semilogarithmic paper, as in Figure 5.3, the population sizes at the two census dates are given by points A[0], A[2]. If the mortality rates had been constant the population at the time of the fishing season, t[1], would have been A[1]. In fact the real changes in the population would be described by the line A[0]BCA[2] in the figure where BC represents the catch of 300 fish, and the two parallel lines A[0]B, CA[2] the decrease due to natural mortality. As the two triangles A[0]BA[1], A[1]CA[2] are similar the ratio of the lengths BA[1]: A[1]C (as measured by a ruler on the semilogarithmic paper) will be equal to the ratio of the periods (t[2] - t[0]): (t[2] - t[1]). As a first approximation take some position of C and the position B at a value
More generally, fishing takes place over a period - the open season - during which the fishing mortality can be taken as constant. Censuses are made at two times outside the fishing season, so that the time between the two censuses includes two periods before and after the open season during which only natural mortality is occurring. As a first approximation the known catch, C, may be assumed all to be taken at the midpoint of the season and, using the method described above, a first estimate of natural mortality, M[1], can be obtained. Using this value of M the deaths outside the fishing season can be calculated and hence, by subtraction, the total deaths N during the season, and the total mortality ZT (where T = duration of season) estimated.
Then F may be estimated from
5.6 Exercises
1. (a) A certain mortality causes 25 percent of the population to die each year; what percentage of the initial population is left after 2 years; 6 months; 3 years? What is the corresponding instantaneous mortality coefficient? (N.B. find the coefficient first.) Repeat for mortalities causing 10 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent mortalities per year.
(b) Two causes of mortality, acting independently, cause mortality coefficients of 0.2 and 0.3; what is the resulting total mortality coefficient? Repeat with coefficients of 0.7 and 0.1; 1.0 and 0.3.
(c) Two causes of mortality act independently on a population; alone they would cause respectively 20 percent and 30 percent of the population to die within a year. Do 50 percent of the population die within a year? If not, what is the percentage that does die (N.B. convert to instantaneous mortality coefficients)? Repeat for pairs of mortalities causing 70 percent and 30 percent; 80 percent and 70 percent mortalities.

If so, what are the values of a, b, c, d? (Estimate these from the slope and intercept of the straight-line relation). If the y's are indices of the density of a certain year-class of fish at yearly intervals, do the data fit constant mortality coefficients? If so, what are the fractions surviving each year, and what are the instantaneous mortality coefficients?
2. A research vessel in five one-hour trawl hauls caught the following numbers of fish at each age
I, 30; II, 450; III, 120; IV, 70; V, 25; VI +, 15
A year later, the catches in twelve one-hour hauls were
I, 60; II, 960; III, 480; IV, 120; V, 72; VI +, 42
Assuming for the purposes of this example that, with the mesh size in use, the catch per hour gives a valid index of density for two-year-old fish and older, estimate the total mortality coefficient during the year. If the only data available were those for the first of these years, give an estimate of the average total mortality during the previous few years. (In practice 5 or 12 hauls would generally be quite insufficient to provide a valid index of density.)
3. A group of fish is subject in two successive years to total mortality coefficients of 0.85 and 0.80. If the number present at the beginning of the first year is 1 000 what is the average number present in each of the two years? What is the total mortality coefficient estimated from these two averages?
4. A plankton survey showed that 2 × 10^11 eggs were laid during a spawning season. Fecundity studies showed that the average mature female laid 10^5 eggs. Market studies showed that 3 000 000 fish were landed during the year following, and of these 40 percent were adult females (i.e. had spawned at least once). What percentage of the spawning females was caught during the year? If the total mortality coefficient was 1.2, what were the fishing and natural mortality coefficients?

6. The table below gives the age composition of cod in terms of numbers landed per 100 ton-hours fishing by United Kingdom trawlers, in the Barents sea, and the total fishing effort in each year.

Year
Tabulate the total mortality coefficient for each pair of years for each age. Examine the data and decide from what age the fish are fully represented in the catches. What evidence is there that the age at full recruitment is different in the pre- and post-war periods? Hence obtain a single estimate for the mortality between successive pairs of years (take the ratio 7 and older; 8 and older). By relating this mortality graphically and by calculation of the regression line to the average fishing effort in the two years, estimate the natural mortality and the fishing mortality in 1958. What are the confidence limits to the natural mortality? (Note that the estimate of M obtained will, as usual, include any net migration from the fished area.)

6.1 Data for mortality rates and population size
Tagging of fish can be used in studying growth, and movements and migration. This section, however, is concerned only with the use of tagging data to determine the mortality rates of the population, and the size of the population. (Growth is referred to in section 3.) The simplest assumption is that the tagged fish are subject to constant fishing and natural mortality rates which are the same as in the natural untagged population, and these can be estimated separately, because, unlike the natural population, the initial number in the tagged population is known precisely.
That is, if N[0] fish are tagged at a certain moment, the number N[t] alive after time t is given by
The rate at which these are caught is equal to the fishing mortality coefficient times the number alive and is therefore given by
where n = number of tagged fish recaptured.
The total number of returns from t = 0, the time of tagging up to time T is therefore obtained by integrating, i.e.
If the returns are grouped in time intervals of length T, the number n[r] caught during the rth interval between times rT, (r + 1) T is therefore
(Note: The first interval after tagging is r = 0.)
The number caught in successive intervals can therefore be used, knowing N[0], to give estimates of F and M. In particular,
so that if log n[r], is plotted against r, the result is a straight line, slope - (F + M) T. (An alternative and rather more convenient form of this equation is given in equation [6.9].) Using this value of (F + M), F can be estimated from the numbers returned in any interval, using equation (6.2), or from the intercept of the y-axis, which from equation (6.3) is
Alternatively, the total number of returns up to time t is
Unfortunately the assumptions made on this simple example are not often fulfilled. The types of errors which may arise can be placed in definite groups, according to their effect on the various estimates.
(a) Errors which affect the estimate of the rate of fishing (F), but not the estimate of total mortality (Ricker's type A, Beverton and Holt's type 1):
(i) death of fish immediately after tagging;
(ii) incomplete reporting of tags recaptured by fishermen (provided the proportion not reported stays constant; a variable reporting rate would also affect the estimate of total mortality).
(b) Errors which affect the estimate of the total mortality, but not that of fishing (Ricker's type B, Beverton and Holt's type 2):
(i) loss of tags from fish which occurs at a steady instantaneous rate throughout the experiment;
(ii) additional mortality of tagged fish, also occurring throughout the experiment;
(iii) emigration of tagged fish.
© Errors affecting estimates of both fishing and total mortality:
(i) tagged and untagged fish not equally vulnerable to fishing, e.g. the additional likelihood of fish tagged with Petersen disks to be retained by a net;
(ii) tagged fish not uniformly mixed with the untagged population.
Type (a) errors will lead to an underestimate of the true fishing mortality, which in itself may often be useful. They can often be detected and possibly measured by suitable observations. Thus in suitable conditions tagged fish can be kept in tanks or cages and their mortality for the period after tagging can be directly observed. Less directly the percentage returns of fish which when tagged were in different conditions - lively or not so lively, damaged or apparently undamaged, etc., or captured by different methods - can be compared. If there is any mortality due to the shock of capture and tagging then it will presumably be lower for lively fish, and higher for bruised or damaged fish (loss of scales often appears to be particularly critical). Absence of such difference can be taken as an indication, though not proof, of little or no such mortality.
Nonreporting of tags can often be detected by comparing the number of tags returned per unit quantity of fish caught by various groups of vessels fishing in the tagging area - individual boats, different countries, etc. It may be directly measured by feeding known numbers of tagged fish into the catches; this is general practice with mechanical methods of recovery (e.g. magnets at fish meal factories), but can, particularly with the co-operation of a few fishermen, be used for normal external tags returned by fishermen or shore workers.
Type (b) losses can be considered as an additional cause of mortality, i.e. loss of individuals from the population of tagged fish, so that equation (6.1) should be written as
where X includes all causes of reduction of tagged fish other than fishing - loss of tags and emigration as well as natural mortality. Equation (6.4) and the corresponding form of equation (6.2)
will be the usual form for analysis of tagging data, so that in fact only the fishing mortality of the natural population will be estimated from tagging. Natural mortality will be given by subtraction from the total mortality, Z, estimated from age composition, etc.
Some quantitative estimate of type (b) losses can sometimes be obtained, for instance losses of tags (but not mortality of tagged fish) can be estimated by attaching two tags to each fish and noting the proportion of fish returned with both tags, and with only one tag, and the change in this proportion with time.
Differential vulnerability to fishing of tagged fish can usually be eliminated by suitable design of tags. Fish carrying button-type tags are likely to be particularly vulnerable to certain types of gear - e.g. set nets - and if possible such tags should not be employed where this type of gear is used, but if they have to be used, or in order to interpret past data, the extent of the extra fishing mortality can be gauged by comparing the rate of return of fish with different types of tags.
6.2 Varying distribution in space
A distribution of tagged fish different from that of untagged fish is likely to present one of the major problems. If mixing is relatively quick, returns during some initial period, 0 to t', during which the tagged fish are mixing with the untagged population, may be omitted in the computations. The analysis is then carried on from time t', with a reduced initial number of tags, using equation (6.1) in the form
This mixing may be effectively speeded up by a suitable pattern of tagging. The aim is to have the ratio of tagged to untagged fish the same throughout the population. This might for instance be achieved by making an evenly spaced grid of trawl stations covering the whole area, and tagging all, or a constant proportion of, the fish caught at each station. This is possible in a small area but not easy to do in, say, the North sea.
In a large area such as the North sea it may not be possible to ensure effective mixing of tagged and untagged fish, or at least by the time the mixing has occurred most of the returns have taken place, and to ignore returns occurring before mixing was effectively complete would mean discarding most of the available data. However, if good information is available on the geographical distribution of the fishing effort, and on the positions of the capture of the returned tags, useful estimates of the fishing mortality on the untagged population can be made. The logical steps are:
(a) Estimate the fishing mortality, F, on the tagged population.
(b) From the distribution of fishing effort and of the tagged fish estimate the fishing intensity, f, on the tagged population.
(c) Hence estimate q, in the relation F = qf.
(d) Estimate the fishing intensity on the whole population.
(e) Hence, assuming that q for tagged and untagged fish is the same, estimate the fishing mortality on the whole population.
It should be noted that, especially in the first steps, it is not necessary to consider fishing by all vessels, or in all areas, provided the same section of the total is used in computing fishing mortality (from returns of tags) and fishing intensity (from data on fishing effort). For instance, in the North sea some of the most extensive detailed data on fishing effort is of fishing by United Kingdom deep-sea trawlers; it therefore may be convenient to compute the fishing mortality and intensity only from the data of United Kingdom trawlers, and ignore returns of tags, and fishing activity by United Kingdom seiners and inshore vessels, and by vessels of other countries.
Consider a small area around the position of tagging in which mixing of tagged and untagged fish takes place quickly. For a certain time interval, i, let
f[i] = fishing intensity (effort per unit area per unit time)
n[i] = number of tagged fish returned.
Then
While the following assumptions may not be completely justified, to a first approximation the fishing intensity within the small area chosen around the release point may be taken as constant, and the movement out of this area defined by a constant exponential coefficient, D, and therefore the number of tagged fish in the area after time t, N[t], will be given by
or
Thus, so long as (F + X + D)T is small, i.e. the numbers do not change very greatly during one interval, to a close approximation the term in the brackets will be equal to unity
where again the last term may be neglected if the change in numbers during the interval is small, i.e. if the logarithm of numbers recaptured during each interval is plotted against the midpoint of the interval, then the plot should be a straight line, slope - (F + M) T, and intercept on the y-axis log FN[0]T.
Equation (6.7) can be extended to cover data from more than one small area around the release point. Denoting values for particular areas by prefixes
and therefore
so that the analysis can be carried out as before, using the sum of the tags returned per unit fishing intensity in each small area. The analysis can be carried out only when sufficient effort data are available; if tags are returned from a mixed fleet, some of which provide adequate effort data and some of which do not, then in all the analysis only data from the fleet or fleets providing complete data both of effort and tags returned should be used. Tagged fish caught by the other fleet are considered as other losses. Data from the other fleet are brought into the considerations only at the end, when computing the fishing mortality on the population as a whole.

SECTION 7. RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION
7.1 Trawl selection
7.2 Recruitment
7.3 Size limits
7.4 Gill-net selection
7.5 Exercises
Not all sizes or ages of fish undergo the same fishing mortality: small fishes may escape through the meshes of a net, or not be in the main fished area. It is useful to distinguish the part due purely to behaviour (in the widest sense) of the fish themselves - recruitment - and that due to the properties of the gear selection.
7.1 Trawl selection
Selection is simplest in the bag-type of gear - trawls, seines, etc. For these gears it is usual to assume that the size composition of the fish entering the mouth of the net is the same as that in the immediate vicinity of the gear. The selectivity of such gears therefore becomes a question of escape, through the meshes, of fish which have entered the net. For many species there is evidence to show that most of this escape occurs through the cod-end. Selectivity can therefore be determined directly if the numbers of each size of fish entering the net can be estimated, either by attaching a small-meshed cover over the cod-end or other parts, or from the size-composition of the catches of nets of much smaller meshes fished at the same time and place. Whichever method is used, the results can be expressed as the proportion of fish at each length entering the net which are retained in the cod-end. When these proportions are plotted against length, the selection curve of the net
for the species concerned is obtained. A typical example is shown in Figure 7.1.
FIGURE 7.1. - Simple selection curve. Determination of mean selection length.
A selection curve may extend over a range of length of fish of perhaps 10 cm or more, which means that as young fish begin to grow into the selection range they at first suffer only a low fishing mortality. As they grow larger, their chance of escaping from the net (having entered it) gets less, until, eventually, they are too large to escape at all; only then are they exposed to the full fishing mortality rate - whatever that may be. Although it is possible to introduce this progressive change of fishing mortality coefficient over the selection range into yield assessments, it is usually sufficient to represent the selection process by a single mean selection length l[c], and assume that all fish of length less than l[c] are released, and that all those greater than l[c] are retained by the gear, and experience the full fishing mortality.
The important quantity is therefore
t[c]
= mean selection age
= mean age of entry to the catch, or mean age at first capture
In Figure 7.1 the mean selection length l[c] is the length which makes the two shaded areas A and A' equal. If the selection curve is symmetrical, or nearly so, this will be the length at the midpoint of the curve, i.e. the 50 percent length, at which half the fish entering the net escape and half are retained. If the curve is not symmetrical, l[c] can be calculated by equating the two areas between the selection curve and the y-axis, and between the line l = l[c], and the y-axis. Suppose the lengths are classified, the ith class being of size h[i] and limited by the lengths l[i], and l[i+1]; the corresponding ordinate to the ith class is y[i] where i = 0, 1, 2, ... n.
Then the area to the left of the selection curve is equal to the area of the rectangle of height 1 and base l[n+][1] minus the area under the selection curve. This last area can be approximated by the sum of the rectangle areas for each length-class, i.e., S h[i]·y[i]. The total area to the left of the selection curve is therefore l[n+][1] - S h[i]·y[i], which, as the total height of the curve is 1, will equal l[c]. If h[i] is constant and equal to 1 cm, l[c] = l[n+][1] - S y[i].
For trawls, the mean selection length l[c] is generally proportional to the mesh size, m, i.e.
l[c] == b · m
where b is the selection factor
This expression enables the mean selection factor for any mesh size to be estimated from the results of experiments with a small number of different mesh sizes. The selection factor also does not vary much for fish of roughly the same shape. There is some variation in selection factor with the condition of the fish, and also with the material and construction of the meshes; light flexible materials (e.g. nylon) give higher selection factors than thicker materials (e.g. manila).
Besides the mean selection length (50 percent point) selection curves also differ in their sharpness - whether selection occurs over a small or wide range of sizes. This is usually measured by the selection range - the difference between the lengths at which 25 percent and 75 percent of the fish are retained by the gear.
7.2 Recruitment
Recruitment is the process in which young fish enter the exploited area and become liable to contact with the fishing gear. This may involve an actual movement, as in the North sea plaice, which moves, when relatively old (about three to four years), from the shallow nursery area along the coast into the main fishing grounds. Recruitment may involve only a change in habit, such as in the North sea haddock, where young and old occur in the same areas, with the very young fish being pelagic, and recruiting to the exploited phase when they take up a demersal habitat in the autumn of their first year of life. Mathematically, the important quantity is t[r] = mean age at recruitment.
Recruitment is, by its nature, much less easy to express in quantitative terms than mesh selection. As the main interest is in the combined effect of recruitment and selection - i.e. the pattern of entry into the catch - the recruitment pattern is very important when it is above, or overlaps, the range of gear selection, but not when it is complete before gear selection starts. If therefore all fish have been recruited at a size below the selection range of any likely mesh size, then the precise pattern of recruitment may be ignored, and it can be taken arbitrarily as occurring at some convenient length or age below the selection range (see Figure 7.1). Where important, the general form of the recruitment curve may be determined by a proper knowledge of the biology of the species, and possibly estimated with greater accuracy by surveys, with research vessels, of the young fish both on and off the main fishing grounds. Failing this an estimate may be obtained by comparing the
size composition of actual catches of commercial vessels with the known selectivity of the gear in use. Normally the recruitment will occur over a range of sizes and may be described by the same type of curve as the selection curve of Figure 7.1.
If selection and recruitment are occurring over the same range, as in Figure 7.2, then the effective selection, i.e. the proportion P[l] of the full fishing mortality to which the fish of a given size in the stock are exposed will be given by the equation
P[l] = r[l] × S[l]........................................... (7.1)
where
r[l] == proportion recruited, i.e. ordinate of recruitment curve,
S[l] = proportion of those entering the net which are retained, i.e. the ordinate of the selection curve.
FIGURE 7.2. - Combination of a selection curve and recruitment. Recruitment over a spread of lengths.
Thus the resultant selection curve, which expresses the effective entry of fish to the catch, is obtained as the product of the recruitment and mesh selection curves, and from it the resultant mean selection length can be determined as before by equating the two areas A, A'.
Sometimes, as in cases where the recruits migrate into a fishing area, recruitment, in terms of length, can be quite sharp, approaching in the extreme case knife-edge selection at a threshold length l[r], as in Figure 7.3. Fish below length l[r], suffer no fishing mortality at all, since they are not within the range of the gear. But on reaching length l[r], they are at once exposed to a high fishing mortality (as drawn in Figure 7.3 more than half of the full fishing mortality). The resultant selection curve in this case therefore starts at length l[r], and rises vertically to the selection curve of the gear; thereafter it is identical with the selection curve itself. Again, however, the mean selection length l[c] can be calculated from this resultant curve, in this case l[c] is such that the two areas A and A' of Figure 7.3 are equal.
FIGURE 7.3. - Knife-edge recruitment.
7.3 Size limits
If a minimum legal size limit, l[s] say, is set within or above the selection range of the gear in use, the entry to the landed catch can be represented by a curve which starts at l[s], and rises vertically until the true selection curve is reached (see Figure 7.4). The mean selection length l[c] is calculated in a similar way and is such as to equalize the areas A and A' of Figure 7.4.
FIGURE 7.4. - Effect of size limit (l[s]) on the effective selection curve.
Undersized fish will also be taken, and since they cannot be landed they must be rejected at sea. The effect of this capture and rejection on the yield from the stock depends on how many of the rejected fish survive. If all survive, the situation is the same as if the recruitment curve to the landed catch were the true selection curve.
If on the other hand, some or all undersized fish die after rejection, each year-class is subjected to a certain fishing mortality before it reaches length l[s], as represented by the lower part of the selection curve in Figure 7.4. The resultant fishing mortality coefficient which takes account of the capture and rejection of undersized fish is obtained by calculating the mean of that part of the selection curve which is below the size limit. Calling this mean length l[p], then it is such as to equalize the areas B and B' of Figure 7.4. In other words, it is assumed that fish are not caught at all until they reach length l[p], and are then subjected to the constant fraction a of the full fishing mortality rate until they reach size l[s] (a is the ordinate at length l[s], see Figure 7.4). If growth from length l[p] to length l[s] occupies a period t[s] - t[p] (see below) and the fraction q of rejected fish die, then the year-class is reduced by the factor
as a result of capture and rejection of undersized fish before it enters the marketable size range. In this expression F is the full fishing coefficient to which fish are exposed when they have grown beyond the selection range of the gear.
7.4 Gill-net selection
The selectivity of gill-nets is such that the proportion of fish retained is a maximum at some optimum size, and falls off for fish bigger or smaller than this optimum. If the size distribution of the fish in the fishing area can be determined directly by using some gear which is nearly unselective, or where selectivity is known, e.g. a trawl, then the selectivity of the gill-net may be determined at once. That is, if the numbers of a given size, l, of fish caught per unit fishing time by gill-nets and the presumed nonselective gear are [G]C[l], [T]C[l] respectively, the fishing mortality exerted by the gill-net on fish of length/will be proportional to
When a nonselective gear cannot easily be used, then the selective properties are best estimated by using a range of gill-nets of several different sizes. For any particular size of fish the distribution of catches by different mesh sizes will be analogous to the distribution of catches by a particular mesh size of different sizes of fish, having a maximum at some optimum mesh size, and falling off at each side. From the data of catches by different nets (adjusted if necessary to allow for different total fishing time by different mesh sizes) such distributions can be obtained for each size of fish. These can be combined by expressing both variables in standard terms - mesh size as the ratio of its perimeter to the girth of the given size of fish, or as a ratio of its size to the most efficient mesh size for that size of fish, and numbers of fish caught as a ratio of the numbers caught with the mesh used and with the most efficient mesh (see McCombie and Fry, 1960; Gulland
and Harding, 1961).
If it is assumed that each mesh has the same optimum fishing power, i.e. causes the same fishing mortality on the size of fish for which it is most efficient, then the combined data can be used at once to give not only the relative efficiencies of different nets on a given size of fish, but for a net of a given mesh size, the relative efficiencies on different sizes of fish, i.e. its selectivity.
The selectivity may also be estimated by comparing catches of only two mesh sizes, provided some assumption is made concerning the form of the selection curve. This is often close to normal, and if it is assumed in fact to be normal, then putting
C[l] = catch of fish of length l per unit fishing time
where
N[l] = number of fish of length l liable to capture by the gear
p[m] = fishing power of net of mesh size m
l[m] = length of fish for which the mesh size m is most efficient
S[m] = standard deviation of the mesh selection curve
If two meshes, A and B, are fished on the same population, then, in the obvious notation
or, taking logarithms to base e,
and, if it is further assumed that the standard derivation of the selection curve is constant, i.e. S[A] = S[B] = S, this reduces to
The right-hand side is linear in l, that is, can be expressed in the standard form a + bl, where
Thus if the log of ratio of the catches per unit time of nets of different size are plotted against length the result is a straight line, from which can be estimated
From this l[A], l[B] and S^2 cannot be estimated separately, and hence the selection curves determined, without some extra assumptions; however it is reasonable to assume (as in the previous section for a range of mesh sizes) that the fishing powers of the two nets are equal, and also that the optimum length is proportional to mesh size (usually in practice equivalent to a fish whose girth is slightly greater than, say 1.1 times, the perimeter of the mesh).
and hence the selection curves can be determined.
Other assumptions can be made about the shape of the selection curve; in particular it might be assumed as above that the curve is normal, but that the standard deviation is proportional to the mesh size. This model often fits the observed data better than the model based on constant standard deviation (see Regier and Robson [1966] for a full review of gill-net selectivity).
When the selection curve of the gill-net has been determined, subsequent population analysis is simpler if the curve can be represented by a more simple form, analogous to the knife-edge approximation to the trawl selection. Two selection lengths are needed, 4, the length at which the fish enter the selection range, and l[d], at which they grow out of it. That is, the fishing with a gill-net with the selection curve of Figure 7.5 has the same effect as a constant mortality between lengths l[c] and l[d], where the pairs of shaded areas A and A', and B and B' are equal.

Draw the selection curves for plaice and whiting from these data and determine the mean selection lengths (l[c]). Note that the number entering the net is for (a) (alternate hauls) equal to the catch in the small-meshed net, but for (b) is the sum of the fish retained in the cod-end, and those which went through the meshes, i.e. in the cover.
Calculate selection factors.

Calculate the resultant selection curve with a mesh of 112 mm (using the result from Exercise 1) and hence the value of 4.
If instead of the above recruitment curve, recruitment was found to be effectively "knife-edge" at 26 cm, what would be the value of l[c] with a 112-mm mesh?

5. Nine sizes of gill-net were used for catching salmon in the Frazer river in 1947 and 1948. The numbers of fish of sizes caught by each mesh (adjusted for different fishing times) were as follows (data adapted from Peterson, 1954)
Fork length
Mesh sizes

(a) Graphical method. By plotting for each size group separately the numbers caught against mesh size, estimate the numbers of each size of fish which would be caught by the most efficient mesh for that size of fish. Hence express the catch of any mesh as a percentage of the potential catch by the most efficient mesh, i.e. the selectivity of that mesh size for that size of fish.
Combine these selection curves for all meshes by expressing the mesh size as a proportion of the most effective mesh for the length group in question. Hence obtain a single combined selection curve of a gill-net on salmon.
(V) Analytic method. Calculate the logarithm of the ratio of catches of fish of a given size taken by pairs of adjacent mesh sizes. Assuming the selection curve for each mesh is normal and of constant variance, and that the mean selection length of any mesh is proportional to the mesh size, calculate the selection curve for each mesh.

SECTION 8. GENERAL PROBLEMS OF ASSESSMENT
8.1 The need for stock assessment
8.2 The concepts of sustainable yield and potential yield
8.3 The unit stock
8.1 The need for stock assessment
The previous section deals with problems of estimating the important parameters (growth, mortality, etc.) of fish populations which are of scientific interest, but not of direct interest to others concerned with fish stocks (members of the industry, administrators, etc.). It is, for instance, of no direct relevance to the practical problems of the industry that the present fishing mortality coefficient has a value of, e.g. 0.50. This section of the manual is concerned with the use of these estimates of the parameters to determine the total catch, and how the catch and the catch per unit effort (catch per boat, or catch of the individual fisherman) varies with changes in the pattern of fishing. These results are of direct practical interest - for instance, analysis showing that any increase in fishing above the present level (giving a fishing mortality of 0.50) would give no sustained increase in total catch is of vital importance for plans of possible expansion of fishing.
The problems of stock assessment occur at all stages of the development of a fishery, with the need for accuracy and precision increasing as the fishery develops. In an undeveloped fishery all that is generally required is a rough measure, say to within a factor of two or three, of the magnitude of the resource and the potential yield from it and also a measure of the decrease in catch per unit effort likely to be caused by future increases in fishing effort. These estimates may be used as bases for determining the possibilities of expansion. Later, better estimates will be required to determine when the fishery is approaching the level beyond which further expansion of fishing will give little increase in total catch, so that further expansion can be discouraged, or some form of regulation considered. Finally, in a very intense fishery, very accurate estimates may be necessary to ensure proper regulation, e.g. in setting precise catch quotas, etc.
At each stage, the scientist may be called upon to come to conclusions and give advice on the basis of data which might be considered inadequate for scientific conclusions. However, it is often essential that advice should be given, with explicit statements of its reliability where necessary, especially when a fishery is developing rapidly. For instance, in such a fishery a further expansion of say 30 percent may be actively considered. Scientific advice is required on whether the stock is fully exploited, so that such an increase would give no increase in yield, or, at the other extreme, is very lightly exploited, so that the 30 percent increase in fishing would produce very nearly the full 30 percent increase in total catch, or somewhere between. In the absence of advice, the development might take place in the expectation that the increase in fishing will produce a proportional increase in catch, so that the action taken is effectively the same as if the scientific advice
were that the resource was very lightly exploited. If, therefore, there is scientific evidence that the degree of exploitation of the stock is appreciable, this must be stated even if there is no certainty whether the increase in catch from a 30 percent increase in fishing is 5 percent, 10 percent, or 20 percent.
8.2 The concepts of sustainable yield and potential yield
In many discussions of fishery management problems, the terms "sustainable yield" and "maximum sustainable yield" are used. These are particularly, but not exclusively, used in relation to the simple population models, such as those of Schaefer (see section 10.2). These terms can often be useful in explaining the results of population analysis to administration; thus a catch equal to the sustainable yield will, on the assumptions of the simple model, leave the situation as it is. The attainment of the maximum sustainable yield is, at least apparently, a reasonable and definable objective of management, so that if the stock abundance is less than that corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield, it should be allowed to increase, i.e. less than the sustainable yield should be taken. Conversely, if the abundance is above this level, more than the sustainable yield should, on this criterion, be taken. Though a detailed discussion of the objectives of fishery management is
outside the scope of this manual, it is very doubtful if the attainment of the maximum sustainable yield from any one stock of fish should be the objective of management except in exceptional circumstances. When there is a value of fishing effort which will in the long run give an average catch greater than the average catch from any other level of effort, i.e. there is a maximum in the yield/effort curve, then over some range of effort near this maximum the curve will be rather flat. Within this range a reduction of fishing effort from that giving the maximum catch will result in a decrease in catch that is much less than proportional to the reduction in effort. For economic reasons it will usually be more desirable to fish at this lower level of effort than at that giving precisely the maximum catch. Even when the objective is to harvest as much food as possible, this is most likely to be done by diverting effort to some other less heavily exploited stock.
The term sustainable yield also can be misleading, as it rather implies a degree of constancy in the situation - other than changes due to fishing - which often do not exist. In a fluctuating fishery, e.g. one with big changes in year-class strength, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to adjust the amount caught to maintain the stock abundance at the end of the year the same as at the beginning, and when possible the catch taken would fluctuate very widely.
A more useful concept is that of the potential yield. This is the greatest average annual yield that can be taken over a period or under average environmental, non-fishery-induced, conditions, with any pattern of fishing. The actual average yield over a period will be generally less than the potential because it is impossible or undesirable (e.g. due to high costs) to employ the pattern of fishing giving precisely the potential yield. In any one year the yield may be greater or less than the potential yield, depending on such factors as year-class strength, etc.
8.3 The unit stock
Before population theory can be applied to a particular situation it is necessary to determine to what extent the fish population and the fishery based on it can be treated as a unit system. There is no simple objective definition of what constitutes a unit stock, or a unit fishery, and the definition may be made purely on practical grounds. A group of fish can be treated as a unit stock if the results of assessments and other population studies in which it is treated as a unit stock do not diverge significantly from the real situation. This means, on one hand, that happenings external to the unit stock, e.g. fishing in other areas, do not have a significant effect, and on the other hand, that there are no subgroups within the unit stock with significantly different population characteristics.
One corollary of this definition is that, as the precision of the population studies increases, the choice of unit stock may also have to change. A group of fish may have sufficiently uniform characteristics to be treated as a single stock when these characteristics are known only roughly, but may have to be treated as two or more unit stocks, perhaps with certain mixing rates, each with different characteristics, as these characteristics become measured with greater precision.
A unit stock, as used here, does not necessarily correspond to a biological, or genetic, unit. Thus, if two species in an area have the same growth pattern and mortality rates and are fished on the same grounds by the same gears, then, at least in the early stages of analysis when data are scarce, it may be permissible to treat them as a single unit stock. Conversely, male and female plaice in the North sea differ so much in growth, and in fishing and natural mortality rates, that for detailed analysis they should be treated as different stocks, i.e. yield curves, etc. should be calculated for the male and female populations separately, and the results for the plaice population as a whole obtained by addition.
While most of this course is concerned with the simple situation of a unit stock, or unit fishery, it is worth enumerating here some of the situations which cannot be treated as a unit stock or unit fishery.
(a) Distinct fish stocks which intermingle for some part of the year, and are fished while mixed together. Even if the separation of fish between the stocks at the end of the mixing period is perfect, the fishing mortality of the two stocks has an element in common, and neither can be treated as a unit unless the mixed catch can be separated into the elements from each stock (? Bank and Downs herring in the North sea, ? Southern bight and German bight plaice).
(b) Distinct stocks, fished separately, but with a significant amount of interchange between them (e.g. Iceland and Greenland cod).
© A species inhabiting a large area with no obvious dividing features, so that any two groups of fish in adjacent areas mix freely together, but the mixing is slow enough for the fish at opposite ends of the area to be effectively independent (? many coastal species,? North sea whiting).
A determination of what can be treated as a unit stock will be made from a wide range of information, e.g.
(a) Distribution of the species. This will give an upper limit to the extent of the unit stock, while the presence of more or less effective barriers, e.g. a deep water channel for a strictly demersal species, may suggest subdivisions which could behave as unit stocks.
(b) Spawning areas. A single compact spawning area suggests that the population is a biological unit at least so far as reproduction is concerned. Two or more distinct spawning areas suggest distinct spawning groups, though these may well mix as in types (a) and (b) above.
(c) Catch and effort data. Common features in records of catch and effort data for adjacent fisheries over a period may indicate that they are acting on the same stock and are parts of the same unit fishery.
(d) Age-composition data. Comparisons of the relative strength of year-classes in different areas may indicate the extent to which the fish in different areas are recruiting from the same source. Mortality rates, especially when combined with effort data, can be compared as in ©.
(e) Tagging. This may not always give reliable results (incomplete returns from some areas, etc.), but under favourable conditions it is a valuable technique, being especially valuable as giving a mixing rate (when mixing takes place) which can be expressed in quantitative terms.
(f) Morphological or physiological characteristics. Genetic differences are good evidence of groups of fish being independent stocks, but the converse is not true. Characters which may be environmentally determined (e.g. vertebral counts) are less satisfactory, since differences can exist among groups of fish which are mixing but not mixing completely.

SECTION 9. THE SIMPLE YIELD CURVE
9.1 Derivation of the equation for yield
9.2 Other forms of the yield equation
9.3 Exercises
9.1 Derivation of the equation for yield
Previous sections have been concerned with methods of collecting the basic data, and analysing them so as to obtain estimates of the basic population parameters - growth, mortality, age at recruitment, etc. This and later sections will be concerned with using these estimates to explain and understand the past history of the fishery, and to predict its future; in particular to predict the effect of changes in the pattern of fishing due to any proposed conservation or regulatory measure.
The simplest calculations are for a stock in which the various parameters are constant. For such a stock, the calculations are best made in terms of the yield of a single year-class of fish throughout its life, which will be, in the steady state, the same as the yield in one year from all year-classes present in the fishery. The whole life span can be divided into relatively short periods; for each period the number of fish alive, the number caught, the number dying of natural (nonfishery) causes, and the number surviving to the beginning of the next period can be calculated, and the yield, in weight, can be calculated as the product of the numbers caught and their average weight. This process can be done purely arithmetically, but for accuracy the periods chosen should be short, and therefore numerous, and the calculations are bound to be laborious. It is much easier to express the yield in an algebraic form, which has the great advantage of showing explicitly the influence
of the various parameters on the yield.
We will define the terms as follows:
N[t] = number of fish alive at age t
R == number of recruits, i.e. the number of fish alive at age t[r],
R' = number of fish alive at the age t[c] at which they are first retained by the gear in use
M = instantaneous natural mortality coefficient
F = instantaneous fishing mortality coefficient;
then for t[c] < t <t[c]
i.e., the instantaneous rate at which fish are dying of natural causes is equal to the product of the natural mortality coefficient times the number of fish.
and
and for t > t[c], when both fishing and natural mortalities are operating
and
or
The numbers of fish caught in the time interval (t, t + dt) will be F · N[t]dt, so that the total numbers caught, C, will be given by dividing up the total time between t[c] (the age at first capture) and t[L] (the maximum age attained) into short intervals, and adding the contributions from each interval.
Mathematically this is expressed by the integral (see section 2)
or, integrating
Thus, fishing takes a share of the total numbers reaching the age of first capture equal to the ratio of fishing mortality to total mortality.
In the same way the weight caught in the time interval t, t + dt, is given by
dY[t ]=FN[t]W[t]dt
where W[t] is the average weight of a fish of age t.
The total weight caught will therefore be given by
For this to be easily integrated, the expression for the weight has to be in a suitable form; of the growth equations discussed earlier, that of von Bertalanffy is one of the most convenient. That is, we can write
Or, writing the right hand side as a summation,
where
U[0]= 1, U[1] = - 3, U[2]= 3, U[3] = - 1
Then
or, writing t - t[0] = (t- t[c]) - (t[c] - t[0]) and rearranging the terms
on integrating this becomes
Again this expression may be simplified if t[L] is sufficiently large for the last term to be neglected. The yield is given by
or, substituting for R'
Besides the total yield, some other quantities are important. Thus the yield is F times the average biomass of fish in the exploited phase, B', and therefore
Similarly, the average number in the exploited phase is, from equation (9.2'), dividing the catch in numbers by F
The average weight of the individual fish in the exploited phase is therefore
Because the recruitment is unknown and often variable, the yields etc. are normally calculated as yield etc. per recruit.
The steps in calculating the yield directly from equation (9.5) have been set out in the attached work sheets. The first, A, shows a layout for calculating yield for a range of values of fishing mortality, F, selectivity (t[c]) being constant. The entries in the box at the top left will be completed from the knowledge of the various parameters in the stock, either using the best estimates available, or, if the knowledge is not so precise, a range of values for natural mortality etc.; a separate sheet is used for each set of possible values. The entries in the top middle deal with the calculations which are the same for all values of F. Below are four pairs of columns, (B) and (C), corresponding to the four terms in the summation of equation (9.5). (For convenience most of the entries, columns etc. have been labelled with letters; when referred to in later column headings they are enclosed in brackets, to avoid confusion with the letters used for mortality coefficients etc.
In the second row of each column is shown the formula which will normally be used in computing the entry in that column, the third row shows what the entry represents in terms of the various parameters.)
The other work sheets, B.1 and B.2, are used for calculating the yield for varying selectivities. The first is used to calculate t[c] and related quantities from the selectivity, which will normally be defined by the size at first capture l[c]. The yield for the range of selectivities and any particular fishing mortality can then be calculated as on sheet B.2, which is nearly the same as work sheet A.
9.2 Other forms of the yield equation
It is possible to reduce the calculations and also to take into account a length-weight relationship other than the cubic, by expressing the yield Y in another form using the incomplete Beta function.
This function, which is usually denoted by B[x] (p, q) is defined by the integral
where p, q are positive constants and the upper limit of integration, x, is between 0 and 1. For x = 1 the expression is the complete Beta function B (p, q).
To obtain the yield in terms of the Beta function we have, from equation (9.3), for t[L] = ¥
where
which noting that t - t[c] = (t- t[0]) - (t[0] - t[c]) can be written as
or if W[¥ ]is proportional to l^b
Using the transformation
and calculating the limits of integration, for the new variable,
t = ¥ becomes y = 0
The yield in weight, Y, then becomes
Expressing the integral as an incomplete Beta function this becomes
or if b = 3
Tables of the incomplete Beta function are available (Jones, 1957; Wilimovsky and Wicklung, 1963). Tables of g (1 - c)^g have been given by Holt (1957). Thus the yield can be expressed as the product of a constant and two quantities obtainable from the tables.
It should be noted that
i.e. it is the proportion of the total growth in length which is made up before the fish enters the exploited phase. Despite the apparent complexity of the expression for the yield, it is determined by only a few quantities: the proportion of the growth completed when the fish is recruited, and the relative magnitudes of the fishing mortality, the natural mortality, and the growth parameter K.
which may be shown to be equal to g (1 - c)^-^g B[1][-c] (m + g, 4).
Other forms for the yield can be obtained by substituting different formulae for the weight in equation (9.3). In particular, over any moderately short period of time, say to, growth in weight may be treated as exponential;
where w[1] is the weight at time t[1].
The growth coefficient g[1] will change according to the interval chosen, generally decreasing with increasing age. Substituting, the yield in weight during the period t[1] - t[2] is
The total yield may then be obtained by summing over the whole life span, using a sufficient number of intervals. By expressing growth in this form, it may be seen that the size (or age) at which the total mass of a year-class is at its maximum is the size at which g is equal to the natural mortality coefficient M (the "critical size" of Ricker). The greatest yield is then obtained by taking all the year-classes as soon as they reach this size. Where the assumptions of the simple yield equation are not fulfilled (e.g. different growth pattern, parameters not constant, etc.), there is always the possibility to apply the method mentioned in the second paragraph of this section of expressing the yield as the sum of the yields in a large number of small time intervals, within which changes in the size of the individuals and the number of individuals in the stock can be ignored. That is, we approximate to the integral of equation (9.3) by the expression
where the time interval t[c] to t[L]. has been divided into k short intervals, and
F[i] = fishing mortality in the ith period
N[i] = numbers present at the beginning of the ith period
W[i] = average weight of individuals during the ith period
and D t[i] = duration of the ith period.
F[i] may be taken as constant = F, or some empirical values can be used if there is evidence that fishing mortality varies with age. Similarly, W[i] can be determined from a suitable growth curve, or again empirical data can be used to take into account factors such as seasonal variations on growth, etc.
N[i] can be determined from the usual formula
or from the equations
N[1]=R'
N[i+1] = N[i] - (F[i] + M) N[i]D t[i]
The expression of the yield in this form is likely to be particularly useful in any fishery where the assumptions of the simple yield curve are not very closely fulfilled; for instance, very seasonal fisheries, or fisheries such as those with gill-nets, where the fishing mortality may vary with age. Detailed computer studies have been made for the Pacific salmon fisheries where there are complex regulations involving several gears, and a large number of stocks mixing to a greater or lesser extent.

Approximate parameter values for North sea plaice, with a 75-mm mesh, are as follows:
M = 0.1

W[¥ ]== 2 860 g
K = 0.095
t[0] = - 0.8 year
t[r] = 3.7 years
t[c] = 3.7 years
(Note that North sea plaice do not move into the main fishing grounds until they are three to four years old so that the size at first capture is independent of mesh size for meshes up to about 100 mm.)

10.1 Catch and effort statistics
10.2 Schaefer's model
10.3 Changes in selectivity
10.4 Interacting fisheries
10.5 Exercises
The simple yield equation described in the earlier sections depends for its calculation on fairly complete knowledge of the various parameters (growth, mortality, etc.), and with this information it is possible to estimate the steady yield for any combination of fishing mortality and age at first capture. However, even if, as very often happens, information is far from complete, it is possible to answer certain specific questions, e.g. would a moderate increase in size of first capture increase or decrease the steady yield?
10.1 Catch and effort statistics
This relation is best expressed graphically by plotting cpe against/; the best fit is usually not a straight line, but a curve concave upward, for instance the curves for plaice or cod at Iceland (Gulland, 1961b). From this curve, giving the steady state relation between cpe and effort, the corresponding relation between catch and effort can be determined at once by multiplication.
This approach is very close to the constant parameter model of the complete yield curve, in which density-dependent effects are ignored, as most of these take effect over longer periods of time. For instance, in the example above, if recruitment is affected, the present stock is the offspring of the stock on the average six to seven years earlier, which in turn was determined by the fishing over the previous three years or more.
The major advantage of this method is that it requires easily obtainable data; total catch is usually known, and effort or cpe data are usually among the earliest semiscientific data to be collected. If there are errors in the effort data (the most likely being uncorrected trends, such as increased efficiency) these will affect both x and y values in the plotting, and tend to displace the points along lines of the form y = a/x. The displacement is in a similar direction as the general form of the expected regression, so that it appears that errors in effort measurement will not distort the estimate of the relation between cpe and effort, but may make the statistical significance of the fit greater than it really is. If the series of data is long enough the effect of changes other than simply of total effort may be studied. Thus if there has been a change in fishing practice, e.g. an increase of mesh size, in the middle of the series, then, if this has had a significant
effect on the stock, two different regressions of cpe on effort for the periods before and after the change could be determined.
10.2 Schaefer's model
Another method of analysis depending chiefly on catch and effort data is that of Schaefer, 1954, 1957. The population biomass, B, is considered as a single entity, which would, if fishing were not present, increase at a rate determined by its size, i.e.
where f (B) is some function of B, being zero when B = 0, and when B is at its maximum B[M], and f (B) will have a maximum at some intermediate value of B.
Therefore, when fishing is present
Clearly the population will remain constant if Y = f (B), so that at any population size there will be a certain equilibrium catch, and this will be a maximum when f (B) is a maximum.
The form of f (B) may be determined from data on catch and effort, provided there is also some information (e.g. on tagging) from which catch per unit effort figures can be converted into absolute terms, i.e. if the coefficient q (k[2] in Schaefer's notation) is known. Thus if the values of catch per unit effort are known at the beginning and end of a year
f (B)=aB (B[M] - B)
These advantages are, however, mainly superficial. The analytic model can be modified to take into account the complexities of any natural population whereas the Schaefer model is very difficult to modify. Also the natural rate of increase of a population is not determined uniquely and solely by the population biomass at one time. The recruitment is determined (apart from environmental factors) by the adult stock some time in the past, often several years. The increase in population biomass due to growth either absolutely or as a percentage of the present biomass depends as much if not more on the age structure of the population than on its total biomass. To take these effects into account the use of some form of analytic model is required.
10.3 Changes in selectivity
The simplest and perhaps the most important question concerning the effect of a possible change in selectivity is whether the change will result in an increase or decrease in the average catch. This can be done, following Alien (1953), by comparing the weight of the individual fish of the size it is proposed to release, with the probability of their being caught again later and their average weight when caught. That is, if
W[c] = weight of individual fish at the mean selection length
Some more detailed effects of changes in selectivity can be also determined from a knowledge of the size composition of the landings (see Gulland, 1961a, 1964a). Thus, immediately following a change in gear there will be no change in the stock, and the numbers of any given size, l, of fish landed by the new gear (e.g. increased mesh size) will be given by
where
[i]N[1] = numbers landed by old gear
[l]N[k] = numbers landed by new gear
[l]r[1] ^= proportion retained by old gear
[l]r[3] = proportion retained by new gear.
If also [l]W = average weight of fish of length l then the total weight W[1], caught with the old gear, is given by
W[1] = S [l]W[l]N[i][ ]................... (10.2)
and weight caught with the new gear, W[k], is
W[k] = S [l]W[l]N[k ]................... (10.3)
Also the total numbers landed by the old gear, N[1], and retained by the new gear, N[k], can be written
N[1] = S [l] N[1], and N[k] = S [l][ ]N[k].
(If the average weights [l]W and the relevant numbers are arranged as parallel columns these calculations of sums of products are simple to carry out on most calculating machines.) The actual immediate change in landings can be expressed as a proportion L of the initial landings, where
When an increase in mean selection length takes place the fish released by the new gear, but which could have been caught by the old gear, will grow, and after a time reach the size at which they will be retained by the new gear, and the catches will increase.
The number, N[R], of fish released, which would previously have been landed, will be equal to N[1] - N[k]. If quantities of small fish are caught and discarded at sea, and not landed, the total numbers released will be greater than the reduction in the landings, and may be calculated as
Thus the long-term landings, W[2], will be given by
W[2] = W[1] (1 - L)(1 + Q) ................ (10.6)
This level of landings may not be reached until several years after the change in selectivity. It will only be complete after a period, equal to the life span of the fish in the fishery, has elapsed since the change in selectivity, although it will be close to this value at a rather earlier date. The catches in the interim period can be estimated as follows. In order to estimate the landings at time t', suppose that fish of the size released will have grown to a certain length l'. Then, at a time t' after the change in mesh size, the fish larger than l' will have been fished by the old mesh when they were of a size in the selection range, so that the stock and catches of these fish will be nearly unaffected by the change, and the weight caught of fish length l > l' would be [l]W[l]N[R]. Fish smaller than length l' would have been under the influence of the new mesh during their life in the exploited phase so the stock and catches of these sizes could be the same as in the
long-term equilibrium state with the new mesh, and the weight caught of fish length l < l' would be (1 + Q) [l]W[l]N[R]. The total weight caught will be W', given by
i.e.
The method can be extended to stocks fished with more than one gear, some of which may not change their selectivities. Here equations (10.1) and (10.3) are applied separately to each fleet to find the immediate effects. The factor Q will be the same for all, and is given from the extension of equation (10.5) in the form
where the summation of N[k] includes the fish caught by all gears (omitting any fish, caught by gears whose selectivity does not change, smaller than the new selection length), but the summation of NR will, of course, only include gears whose selectivity changes. The calculations necessary to assess the results of a mesh change when two gears, possibly catching different sizes of fish, are operating are set out in the work sheet on p. 127.
10.4 Interacting fisheries
The above methods may also be used to study the interaction of different fisheries, particularly of a fishery (A) principally for one species (e.g. herring) which incidentally catches young fish of another species (e.g. haddock), which, when older, is itself the principal object of some other fishery (B).
The steps are again
(a) Calculate the number of fish caught by fleet (A), or the extra number being caught compared with what would have been caught supposing fleet (A) was complying with some desired regulation (= N).
(b) Calculate the reduced numbers of these which will survive until the age of first capture of fleet (B) (= N^1).

10.5 Exercises
1. The table below gives the catch per unit effort (catch, in tons, per 1 000 ton-hours' fishing by United Kingdom trawlers) and the total catch, in thousands of tons, of cod and haddock, at Iceland.
Image
(a) Calculate the total fishing effort, in United Kingdom units, on cod and on haddock each year.
(b) If the average duration of life in the fishery is two years for haddock and three for cod, relate the stock abundance to the past fishing effort. Is there any suggestion that either of these relations has changed? In particular, examine the haddock curve for the years since 1950, when a larger mesh was introduced and trawling was banned in certain areas, including some nursery areas.
2. The table below gives data on catches and catch per unit effort of blue whales in the Antarctic. Taking alternative values of the population size corresponding to a catch per unit effort of 1.00 as 20 000 and 30 000 whales, calculate the change in population size each year, and hence the sustainable yield each year. Plot this against population size in that year, and that five years earlier (assuming blue whales recruit to the exploited stock at five years of age). How may the catch data for the years 1939-46 be used? What is the maximum sustainable yield, and at what population size is it taken?

(b) If the present mesh was 90 mm, what would be the reduction in catch (as a percentage) immediately following an increase to 120 mm?
(c) If it takes an average of six months for the fish released to grow to the size of first capture of the 120-mm mesh, what would be the long-term effect of an increase of mesh to mm, assuming that there is no other fishery, and that the natural mortality of fish in the selection size is 0.2, and E (= F/F + M) = 0.5?
(d) What would be the long-term effects on both fleets (as percentages, and actual weights) if there was also a line fishery operating, taking an average annual catch of five million fish weighing 6 000 tons, and E =0.77 Assume all line-caught fish are larger than the selection size of the 120-mm mesh.
(e) What would be the effects if the trawlers discarded 30 percent of the catch (by numbers), and these fish were all small enough to escape through a 120-mm mesh? (Let T == one year, say.)
4. The average annual catch of haddock by trawlers fishing for herring in 1954-56 was as follows:
Size

24-27 cm

The fishery for haddock lands on an average 70 000 tons per year of fish whose average weight is 330 g.
If the herring trawlers were to use a mesh of the minimum size for demersal fishing, what would be the effect on the haddock catches assuming:
(a) The legal mesh releases all haddock less than 24 cm.
(b) In the haddock fishery some 100 million fish over 24 cm are caught, but are rejected as being below the marketable size of 27 cm.
(c) The fish below 24 cm which would be released by a larger mesh take an average of six months to grow to 24 cm, during which time they would suffer a natural mortality of 0.2.
(d) E = F/ (F+ M) =0.8 (where F includes all forms of fishing).

SECTION 11. CHANGES IN THE PARAMETERS
11.1 Density-dependent effects
11.2 Exercises
In the previous section all the parameters (growth, mortality, etc.) have been assumed to be constant, except for the explicit changes in the fishing mortality or the age at first capture. In fact changes in all are possible, and some, e.g. the annual recruitment, can vary very widely. These changes may be the result, directly or indirectly, of changes in the abundance of stock (and hence possibly influenced by fishing), or be independent of the stock, and the result of changes in the environment - amount of food, etc. The latter can be divided, according to the effect produced, into two types of change. First there are those that alter the shape of the yield curves, so that the results of, for example, an increase of mesh size may be quantitatively different, and secondly those that only affect the height of the yield curve, and which therefore for many purposes can be neglected.
The best example of the second is the big variation that can occur, independent of changes in adult spawning stock, in the strength of successive year-classes of many fish, e.g. in haddock, herring, etc. Calculations omitting data on year-class change may suggest that an increase of mean size from the present (say 100 mm to 110 mm) may increase the steady yield by say 5 percent. From this it need not be true that, if the mesh were increased, the yield in some particular future year would be exactly 5 percent greater than the present, because the year-classes then being fished may be of different strength. What is true (if the calculations are correct) is that the yield would be 5 percent above what it would have been if the old, 100-mm, mesh had been in use. For many practical questions (e.g. is a change from 100 to 110 mm advisable?) the differences due to change in recruitment are not of significance. For this reason, and because, as may be seen in the previous sections,
that is the form in which the expression for the yield is often obtained, many assessments are stated in the form of yield per recruit. An exception is when the amount of fishing depends critically on the strength of the year-classes in the fishery, there being little or no fishing when year-classes are weak. A good example is the haddock fishery on Saint Pierre bank, where there was a big fishery on the outstanding 1949 year-class between 1953 and 1957, with little before or since.
Growth changes can have an effect on the shape of the yield curve, particularly that relating yield to size at first capture. In a heavily fished stock the maximum yield may be obtained with a size at first capture, l[c], not far below the maximum size, L[¥ ], but if there is a change in growth with a new and smaller L[¥ ], not many fish may survive to l[c] and the yield with that value of l[c] may be small.
11.1 Density-dependent effects
While some changes in the environment may mean that the shape of the yield curves in the future will be different from those under the present conditions, density-dependent effects can mean that the real yield curve is different from that calculated on the assumption of constant parameters. If the stock increases, e.g. following a reduction in fishing, the likely effects are that natural mortality will increase, and the growth decrease, but that the recruitment will increase. These effects act in opposite directions, the first two reducing the yield at high stock levels (i.e. at low fishing intensities, or with a large mesh size), but the last increasing the yield under these conditions of fishing. In a heavily fished stock, where reduced fishing or increased mesh size would be expected to increase the yield, density-dependent mortality and growth have a damping effect, tending to make the yield curve flat, but the recruitment effect will exaggerate the changes.
Density-dependent recruitment is therefore rather the more critical effect.
If a relation can be established between any particular parameter and stock abundance, then it is possible to incorporate this into the simple yield equation. Usually it is not possible to produce an explicit mathematical expression for the stock or yield when a parameter changes with stock density, but estimates of stock and yield may be obtained for any given conditions of fishing effort, etc. by successive approximations. For instance, if natural mortality is proportional to stock abundance, then to calculate the yield and stock at say twice the present fishing, we can take a first estimate of a halved stock, and therefore halved M; using this value of M in the equations will give a better estimate of stock, hence of M, which in turn can be used to provide better estimates.
In fact it is often impossible to determine the density effects on the various parameters, especially of natural mortality, and it is probably best to take certain likely relations and see how these affect the shape of the yield curve (see Beverton and Holt, 1957, section 18).
In studying the effect on recruitment two quantities may be related to stock size - the recruitment, i.e. the absolute number of young fish produced from a given stock, and the survival, i.e. the numbers of young per million eggs. If, as is sometimes assumed, recruitment is constant, at least over the range of probable stock sizes, use of both relations may therefore show whether a nonsignificant (in the statistical sense) relation between stock and recruitment is caused by a real and significant (in the biological and practical sense) change in recruitment with stock size which is obscured by variation in the data, or whether the average recruitment is really constant. The second alternative should be detectable by a relation between survival and recruitment.
11.2 Exercises
1. The spawning stock of North sea plaice may be estimated as the catch by weight per 100 hours' fishing by United Kingdom trawlers, and the recruitment as the catch in numbers per hours of four-year-old fish four years later. Available data for the past years are given below (from Beverton, 1962).

SECTION 12. FINAL EXERCISES
(Note: This set of exercises has been constructed to illustrate how the calculations in all the previous sections may be combined to provide assessments and practical advice in the management of a fishery.)
The following data were obtained from the trawl fishery for chafer fish in the Round sea.
The data have been grouped into three periods, on the basis of the different levels of the fishing effort in three periods.
1. Catches. The catches are given in thousand tons, numbers in millions, effort in thousand hours' fishing.
Year
Catch
Effort
Thousand Ions
Millions
Thousand hours
Period 1
Period 2
19S4
Period 3
By plotting the data on total catch and catch per effort, against the appropriate effort, can you obtain a preliminary conclusion on the state of the fishing and the expected effect of a change in effort?
2. The age compositions, obtained from age-length keys based on otolith age readings, and the annual length compositions, are (in percentages):
Age
Year
Percentage
(a) Estimate the total mortality coefficient (Z) for each of the three periods. Determine the coefficient of natural mortality (M), using these values of Z and the average effort in each of the three periods.
(b) Estimate also the coefficient of fishing mortality F.
3. The relation between age and length in the chafer fish is the following:
l[1] = 10 cm; l[2] = 22 cm; l[3] = 33 cm; l[4] = 38 cm; l[5] = 45 cm; l[6] = 48 cm; l[7] =50 cm; l[8] =52 cm.
Fit a von Bertalanffy curve to these observations, and estimate the growth parameters. W= 0.01 l^3
4. Selectivity experiments with a covered cod-end and mesh size-of 100 mm gave the following results:
Length
Number of fish
In cod-end
In cover
cm
Determine the mean selection length, and the selection factor. Note that the lengths were recorded to the cm below.
5. In recent years (i.e. in the third period under consideration) the mesh size used in the fishery for chafer fish was 100 mm. Make use of the yield tables for the following questions:
(a) Is it possible to obtain a greater catch using this mesh size and increasing the fishing effort?
(b) What effort would give the maximum yield for this mesh size, and what is the yield at this level of effort?
(c) What would be the effect on the yield of an increase in the mesh size from 100 to 110 mm, keeping the effort at the level of the third period?
(d) What mesh size would give the maximum yield for this effort, and what would be this yield?

Special reports of commissions, etc.
Much of the stock assessment work now being carried out is being done on behalf of the numerous international commissions responsible for the management of specific stocks, either in a particular area, or of a particular species, or group of species. The scientific result of this work is often only available in the form of reports to the commissions, etc., and does not appear, or appears rather late, in the form of published papers in the usual scientific journals. Reports in which the results of important assessment work appear include:
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA. Report of the Liaison Committee to North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. In International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Cooperative Research Reports, Series B. (Series A includes the reports of working groups on specific subjects)
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES. Reports of the Research and Statistics Committee and of the Assessment Sub-Committee. In International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries. Redbooks.
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION. Report of the Scientific Committee. In International Whaling Commission. Annual reports. (Especially 14th report, containing the report of the Special Committee of Three Scientists)
INTERNATIONAL NORTH PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION. Annual reports. Also Bulletins, especially those concerned with exploitation and management in relation to the abstention principle - No. 4 (herring). No. 7 (halibut). No. 9 (Canadian salmon). No. 10 (U.S. salmon).
INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION. Annual reports. Detailed scientific reports in Bulletins
Several of these bodies also publish journals and other series not directly concerned with stock assessment, though they may contain relevant papers. These are listed under Papers.

Review and Improvement of Data Related to Wood-products Project GCP/INT/679/EC.
Appendix 1 Appendix 2 Appendix 3 Appendix 4 Appendix 5.
Background (A) The EC-FAO Partnership Programme (1998-2000) Strengthening data collection and analysis is critical for improving forest policy formulation and planning at national and sub-national levels. However, this aspect has not been given much attention in most countries, undermining the adoption of sustainable forest management practices. The EC-FAO Partnership Programme (1998-2000) on "Data Collection and Analysis for Sustainable Forest Management in ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Countries - linking National and International Efforts" aims to strengthen national capabilities related to forestry information and statistics. An important starting point for this is to review and validate existing data and to improve the data collection process and methodologies. This present study focuses specifically on aspects of wood-products, such as production, consumption and trade of roundwood, industrial roundwood, sawlogs, veneer logs, pulpwood, wood-chips, sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and paperboard, etc. Apart from improving the quality of basic data, this study is expected to strengthen the technical capacity and expertise of the Directorate of Forestry, Namibia, in forestry data collection and analysis to produce information on the forestry sector. Participation in this effort and networking with other national focal points and experts dealing with wood-products statistics is expected to benefit the government of the Republic of Namibia through sharing of methodologies and information and facilitating learning from each other's experience. (B) Forestry Development in Namibia Namibia's forest resources constitute an important national heritage, which provides both economic th and environmental benefits. Forestry development in Namibia started at the beginning of the 20 century when the role of woody vegetation in environmental protection was recognised by the German colonial government. However, the forest resource suffered a great deal under the South African mandate period when the deliberate policy of uncontrolled cutting was encouraged, especially in the communal areas of the North and North East of the country. Indeed no meaningful development activity was initiated in the sector during South African occupation. Colonial policy of forest exploitation, especially in the communal areas, and commercial areas of Tsumeb and Grootfontein that started in the 1930s continued unabated until Namibia attained independence in 1990. Lack of technical capacity to administer forest concessions worsened the situation of uncontrolled forest exploitation. Meanwhile, poor forestry administration constrained the initiation of any meaningful forestry development activities. In the early 1970s and late 1980s, the country's liberation struggle prevented the implementation of forestry development activities in large areas of Northern Namibia, which needed attention and still carries the bulk of the forest resources. For many years forestry development was managed from a small section under the Ministry of Agriculture. Independent Namibia created, in 1990, a Directorate of Forestry, to highlight the importance of forestry to national development and to carry out programmes that are aimed at.
implementing the national forest policy. Presently, the Directorate of Forestry is still in its early developmental stages. The Directorate produced the first Forestry Strategic plan for Namibia in 1996. In addition, in August 1997 the Directorate started carrying out the Namibia-Finland Forestry Programme to implement the Strategic Plan. The strategic Plan is based on ecological, environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic considerations and it considers production, protection and participation as the three important issues of forestry development in Namibia. New Forest legislation was completed in 1997 and is awaiting approval by parliament. The national forest policy of Namibia has been reviewed and is awaiting approval. The main challenges being faced by the Directorate are manpower development, infrastructure development and improvement of data and information for the planning and management of forest resources. Several forestry staff are in colleges and universities to obtain Forestry Diplomas and BSc Degrees. The infra-structural development is almost complete. Forestry data collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination are in progress and need further support and strengthening to institutionalise the process. A process to develop Criteria and Indicators aimed at monitoring sustainable forest management in Namibia is also on going. A few criteria and indicators have now been selected for actual testing in the field. C) Status of wood products data Availability of statistics on production, consumption and trade of wood products in Namibia is scanty and to a certain extent non-existent. The key relevant authorities such as Ministry of Trade and Industry, Customs and Excise and National Planning Commission (Central Statistics Bureau), although collect wood products data, do not have information on wood products in a form that can be readily and easily disseminated to the public. It seems that so far there is no deliberate plan or efforts to regularly analyse this data and provide the information in a format ready for the user. Therefore, in Namibia there is a great and urgent need to establish a comprehensive database on production, consumption and trade of wood products. Obviously, this is a long-term exercise, which should be continued beyond this review, with the assistance of aid organisations. The Directorate of Forestry has started to keep track of wood products trade data through the recently established Forestry Permit System. However, this system now needs to be expanded to include additional data on wood products such as production, consumption and trade of roundwood, industrial roundwood, sawlogs, veneer logs, pulpwood, wood-chips, sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and paperboard, etc. Only in this way will information on wood products trade be at the fingertips of the Directorate and thereby become easily disseminated to the public.
Namibia's woody resources play a significant role in the country's economy. The majority of the rural populations derive their livelihood from the forest resources. On the other hand, a limited forestry industry also obtains its raw material from these resources. Below is a brief description of the quantitative state of Namibia's forests and the various wood products derived from them.
Forest resources The main vegetation types available as a source for wood products and of economic interest to forestry development in Namibia are Savannahs and Woodlands. Beginning in 1996 up to date the Directorate of Forestry is carrying out forest inventories in these areas to quantify the woody resources mainly for strategic planning. Tables 1 and 2 show summary statistics for various sampled areas within the Savannah and Woodland vegetation, from Forest Inventory reports that are available at the Directorate of Forestry, Savannah vegetation occupy approximately 64 % (about 53 million ha) of the nation's land area. They vary tremendously, from desert shrubs in the Western and Southern parts of the country which support large livestock and game populations, to Mopane trees in the North and Northwest. Mopane is also found in East Caprivi region. In 1997 an area of 8 212 447 ha, in the Woody Savannah and Woodland and Camelthorn Savannah vegetation zone, was inventoried covering eastern and southern parts of Tsumkwe district, northern parts of Otjinene district and eastern parts of Okakarara districts. Forty-one (41) species were enumerated. The dominant height is about 16.5 m. There is about 101 stems/ha and the 3 mean tree volume including branches for all species is 4.2 m /ha. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 3.2 tons/ha (see Table 1). Timber species such as P. Angolensis and B. Plurijuga are not found in these areas. Woodlands occupy approximately 20 % (about 16 million ha) of the nation's land area. They vary from savannah trees and woodlands in the North-Central Caving Region, Capri strip in the Northeast and Waterberg Plateau in the South, and riverine woodlands that constitute important dry season grazing, watershed protection; to large trees in the Erongo mountains. Riverine woodlands are rich in plant and animal biological diversity. From a forestry point of view, woodlands dominated by Pterocarpus angolensis, Baikiaea plurijuga and Burkea africana are the most valuable. A Pterocarpus-Burkea dominated woodland covering an area of 607 949 ha was inventoried in 1996 in West Tsumkwe district (Tables 1 and 2). The estimated area of woodland where P. angolensis or B. africana is the first or second dominant species is 316 860 ha or 52.1% of the area. Fifty-three (53) species were recorded. The dominant height is about 22.3 m. There is about 99 stems/ha and the average tree volume including 3 branches for all species is 17.8 m /ha. There are about 18 P. angolensis and 458 B. africana seedlings per hectare. Most of the P. angolensis seedlings are less than 1.5 m high. The mean saw 3 log volume of P. angolensis trees is 0.31 m /ha or an equivalent average of 1 tree per ha. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 12.5 tons/ha. A Baikiaea-Pterocarpus-Burkea dominated woodland was inventoried in Kavango Region in 1997. The total area inventoried is 17 815 ha. More than 80% of the area was dominated by Baikiaea-Pterocarpus. Twenty-three (23) species were recorded. The dominant height is about 13.2 m. There is about 114 stems/ha and the mean tree volume including branches for all species is 38.
m /ha. The mean saw log volume of P. angolensis trees is 0.65 m /ha and B. Plurijuga 0.28 m /ha or an equivalent average of 1 tree per ha for both species. The average dry biomass including branches for all species is 20.6 tons/ha (See Tables 1 and 2).

Riverine Woodlands are important dry season grazing areas and support a variety of plants and animals, including the human populations that directly depend on them. The ecological value of the ephemeral rivers such as Kuiseb, Huab and Swakop in draining and giving life to the Namib Desert is one of the most outstanding features of Namibia. The agricultural value of the Kunene, Kavango, Kwando, Chobe and the Zambezi rivers in the northern regions and the Orange River in the south are also crucial. Forest inventories still need to be carried out also in the Riverine Woodlands.
Wood products The Savannah and Woodland natural forest resources are being exploited for: commercial timber production for domestic and export markets; fuelwood (firewood and charcoal) for selected domestic and export markets; raw material (mopane roots) for export markets in ornamental wood; raw material for domestic wood carving industry; and wood mainly for domestic fencing and construction in rural communities. Prices charged for harvesting forest products are shown in Appendix.
The Directorate of Forestry estimates the current total economic value of forest resources exploitation to be N$ 1058.2 million per annum. A breakdown of this estimate into various common uses of forest resources is given in Table.
The main wood-products produced, consumed and traded in Namibia are sawn timber, firewood, charcoal, mopane roots, wood for carvings (curios) and poles for fencing and construction. Other wood products such as wood based panels, transmission poles, paper and paperboard etc are imported into the country. However, data on local production, consumption and trade, including trends during the last 5 years are not readily available. Available import/export data are shown in Tables 7a, 7b, 8, 9a and 9b. Sawn timber: The forestry industry is not very strong in Namibia. One of the major constraints in the development of a viable forestry industry is the inadequate forest resources and an environment not conducive to large industrial plantations. Most of the timber produced locally from Namibian sawmills is mainly used for furniture 3 production. Between 1993-95 about 4 410 m of sawntimber were produced. Klaeboe and Omwami 1997 reported that softwoods imports, mainly from South Africa, in 1996 3 were estimated at 25 000 m valued at N$ 25 million. However, it is unknown whether this is roundwood or sawnwood. On the other hand data from Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Tables 7a and 7b, show that about 31000 m3of soft sawnwood valued at N$47 million were imported between 1995-99. For the same period 4800 m3 of sawn hardwood valued at N$14.7 million was imported.
Charcoal: Namibia's charcoal industry is one of the well-organised in Africa. Most of the commercial charcoal is made from bush encroachment species such as Acacia mellifera. A process has started to certify that the charcoal production conforms to environmental and sustainable management standards. This charcoal production is not associated with deforestation, but to remove unwanted bush on beef production farms. In 1997/98 13 537 tons and 433 tons of charcoal (DoF 1997/98 Annual Report) were exported to South Africa and Europe respectively. The size of the domestic market for charcoal is unknown. An estimate, probably, on the high side, is that this market is about 1000 tons annually with a retail value of N$1.5 million. The export sales in 1996 is estimated at 6 000 tons to Europe and South Africa (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). According to CBS 12000 tons were exported in 1997 while between 1997-999 a total of 25700 tons were exported (Tables 7b). Firewood: Firewood is traded both in the formal and informal markets. However, data on the quantities and value of the firewood traded is not readily available. The total firewood consumption in Namibia in 1996 was estimated at 672 331 tons valued at N$ 103 899 000 (See Table 4). It is estimated that the total firewood consumption in Namibia will be 1 071 500 tons in the year 2006. 3 Between 1997-99 over 1 500 m (See Table 9b) were exported. Mopane roots: Mopane roots, harvested from Colophospermum mopane, are used as ornaments in fish aquaria and for decorative purposes. It is estimated that about 900 tons of mopane roots are harvested annually. The estimated quantity and value of mopane roots exported in 1996 is 625 000 Kg valued at N$ 1 242 000 (Table 5). In 1997/98 four hundred and thirty six (436), tons of Mopane roots were exported to South Africa, 29 tons to United States and 152 tons to Europe. Other exported roots, including mopane roots, are shown in Table.
According to the Directorate of forestry's forest permit system, 15000 tons of mopane roots were exported between 1997-1999. Carvings (curios): In Kavango and Caprivi Regions, local organisations are involved in making curios for sale to tourists. Individuals obtain licences from the Directorate of forestry to cut trees or collect dead material for such activities. No data is readily available on the number or volume of trees used for curio production, the value (N$) and quantity of curios produced and traded. It is estimated that the carvers use a total of 440 tons of wood annually. About 38 tons in 1997and 2 tons in 1998 of ornamentals (including curios) were exported (Table 8). Poles for construction and fencing: The amount of poles for construction and fencing mainly in northern Namibia was estimated at 4 602 000 cubic meters in 1996, corresponding to about 3.3 million tons (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). It takes about 9.5 years to replace used poles. It is 3 estimated that by the year 2006 the consumption of poles will decrease to about 4 395 000 m or 3.15 million tons due to use of substitutes for poles. Poles for transmission: Namibia needs transmission poles for its electrical grid and telecommunications system. Since the country does not have plantations to supply the poles, they are imported. Between 1993-95 a total of about 15 000 poles were imported.
Imports and exports Since Namibia does not have wood industries such as pulp and paper, particleboard etc., these wood.
products are imported. Among the main wood products imported are; Chipwood, Fibre board, Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particle board, Plywood, Printed Matter, Pulp (Chemical, Mechanical, Semi Chemical), Roundwood, Sawnwood (Hard and Soft), Sleepers, Veneer sheets, Wafer board, Woodwool, and Wrapping and Packaging. Wood products worth a total of N$1.93 billion (CIF) were imported into the country between 19953 1999 (Table 7a). A total of 35700 tons of assorted wood products and about 99000 m of Chipwood, fuelwood, roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers were imported (Table 7b). Wood products worth N$314.3 million were exported (Table 9a). Among the locally produced wood products, charcoal is Namibia's main wood product export. Over 25700 tons valued at N$23.6 million were exported between 1997-99 (Tables 9a and 9b). Most of the other wood products exported seem to be re-exports or goods in transit through the country.
Current Status of National Forestry Statistics related to Wood-products.
Type of information presently collected at local and national level related to woodproducts In case of the Forest Permit System the following information is collected: Firewood, in Tons; Charcoal, in Tons; Mopane Roots, in Tons; Ornamentals (including Curios), in Tons and no. of pieces, Poles, in Tons and no. of pieces; Timber, in m3 and Tons. Other information collected includes number of timber logs produced, and volume of sawn timber. The National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of statistics), Customs and Excise collect import/export data on various wood products including paper and paper board, plywood, sawntimber, fibreboard, particle board etc. The main wood products categories recorded are: Chipwood, Fibre board, Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particle board, Plywood, Printed Matter, Pulp (Chemical, Mechanical, Semi Chemical), Roundwood, Sawnwood (Hard and Soft), Sleepers, Veneer sheets, Wafer board, Woodwool, and Wrapping and Packaging.

Existing methodologies for data collection Direct measurement. For example, the number of logs cut in the field for concessions and from individual permit holders are recorded on forms. Data recorded on forest permits, e.g. transport, harvest and export permits. The permits are issued by Directorate of Forestry officials Measurement of sawn timber produced from sawmills. Count of furniture produced. Border checkpoints for Customs and Excise. Here various wood products imported and exported are recorded on customs forms. Ad hoc wood consumption surveys. Existing methods for data compilation, validation and dissemination.
Presently, there are no obvious routine mechanisms for data compilation, validation and dissemination. The Directorate of Forestry disseminates information through its annual reports (Table 8).
Ministries, departments, agencies, organisations, NGO's and other national institutions involved in collection, analysis and dissemination of data related to wood-products. The following are the main institutions involved in collection, analysis and dissemination of data related to wood-products:  Ministry of Environment and Tourism (Directorate of Forestry). Data on forest permit issues is collected and disseminated through the directorate's annual reports.  Ministry of Trade and Industry (Import/Export Permits). They have a list of companies dealing.
in wood products trade in Namibia. Ministry of Finance (Customs and Excise). They record import/export data. National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of Statistics). They have a database of import/export data obtained from Customs and Excise. The most important wood-products produced, consumed and traded.
Although the contribution of the forestry sector to GDP has not yet been adequately assessed, wood products play a significant role in the Namibian economy. The Directorate of Forestry estimates the current total economic value of forest resources exploitation to be N$1058.2 million per annum. A breakdown of this estimate into various common uses of forest resources is given in Table.

Source: Namibia Forestry Strategic Plan 1996 The main wood-products produced, consumed and traded in Namibia are sawn timber, firewood, charcoal, mopane roots, wood for carvings (curios) and poles for fencing and construction. Sawn timber: The forestry industry is not very strong in Namibia. One of the major constraints in the development of a viable forestry industry is the inadequate forest resources. Forest resources are mainly found in the north east of the country, in Kavango and Caprivi Regions. The most sought after and over exploited commercial species, Pterocarpus angolensis, does not regenerate very well. Most of the timber produced from Namibian sawmills is mainly used for furniture production.
Between 1993-95 about 4 410 m of sawntimber were produced. Softwoods imports, mainly from South Africa, in 1996 were estimated at 25 000 m valued at N$ 25 million (Kleabo and Omwami 1997). However, it unknown whether this is round or sawnwood or both. The CBS data (Table 7a and 7b) show that between 1995-99 about 31100 m3 soft sawnwood were imported. During the same period over 4800 m3 sawn hardwood were imported. Furniture/Joinery: There are several wood working shops involved in furniture making. The main local species used is Pterocarpus angolensis. Some of the timber is imported. Data on quantities and value (N$) of furniture/joinery products is not readily available. Charcoal: Namibia's charcoal industry is one of the well-organised in Africa. Most of the commercial charcoal is made from bush encroachment species such as Acacia mellifera. A process has started to certify the charcoal. It is not associated with deforestation, but to remove unwanted bush on beef production farms. In 1997/98 13 537 tons and 433 tons of charcoal were exported to South Africa and Europe respectively. The size of the domestic market for charcoal is unknown. An estimate, probably, on the high side, is that this market is about 1000 tons annually with a retail value of N$1.5 million. The charcoal export in 1996 is estimated at 6 000 tons, to Europe and South Africa. The Directorate of Forestry permits system shows that over 61000 tons of charcoal was exported between 1997-99 (Table 8). Data from the CBS (Table 9b) shows that about 25700 tons were exported between 1997-99. Firewood: Firewood is traded both in the formal and informal markets. However, data on the quantities and value of the firewood traded is not readily available. Table 4 shows the total firewood consumption in Namibia in 1996. About 670000 tons (or 924000 m3) worth N$104 million of firewood were consumed. Over 1300 m3 valued at N$2.7 million were imported between 1995-99 (Tables 7a and 7b).

It is estimated that the total firewood consumption in Namibia will be 1 071 500 tons in the year 2006. Mopane roots: Mopane roots, harvested from Colophospermum mopane, are used as ornaments in fish aquaria and for decorative purposes. In 1997/98 four hundred and thirty six (436) tons of Mopane roots were exported to South Africa, 29 tons to United States and 152 tons to Europe. It is estimated that about 900 tons of mopane roots are harvested annually. Table 5 shows the estimated quantity and value of mopane roots in 1996.

The Directorate of Forestry permit system indicates that 1500 tons of mopane roots were exported between 1997-99. This is approximately 500 tons annually. It must be borne in mind that the data capture for the permit system is still on going. Some of the data on the datasheets has not yet been entered into the computer. Carvings (curios): In Kavango and Caprivi Regions, local organisations are involved in making curios for sale to tourists. Individuals obtain licences from the Directorate of forestry to cut trees or collect dead material for such activities. No data is readily available on the number or volume of trees used for curio production, neither the value (N$) and tonnes of curios produced and traded. It is estimated that the carvers use a total of 440 tons of wood annually (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997). Poles for construction and fencing: Table 6 shows the amount of poles for construction and fencing mainly in northern Namibia. Table 6: Standing volume of wood in homesteads 1996 (Klaeboe and Omwami 1997).

4.6 million cubic meters corresponds to about 3.3 million tons. It takes about 9.5 years to replace used poles. These figures are estimates of old and new wood currently in use in the homesteads. The annual consumption, which represents wood for new homes and replacements, is certainly much lower. It is estimated that by the year 2006 the consumption of poles, or poles in use in 3 homesteads, will decrease to about 4 395 000 m or 3.15 million tons due to use of substitutes for poles. Annual import/export figures of wood and wood products: Various private companies are engaged in the import/export trade of wood products. The Directorate of Forestry does not keep wood products import/export records. It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance (Customs & Excise) to keep such records. The Customs and Excise captures the data and sends it to the National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of Statistics). Tables 7a, 7b, 9a, and 9b and summarised from this data. The imported items were grouped into the following major wood products categories: Charcoal, Chipwood, Fibre board, Fuelwood, Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particle board, Plywood, Printed Matter, Pulp (Chemical, Mechanical, Semi Chemical), Roundwood, Sawdust, Sawnwood, Sawnwood (Hard and Soft), Sleepers, Veneer sheets, Wafer board, Woodwool, and Wrapping and Packaging.
Imports Data on imports and exports were obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). It is interesting to note that Namibia is an active importer of wood products. The available import data is for the years 1995 to 1999. For 1999, the data is for the period January to June only. Table 7a shows the value, CIF N$, of imports. Wood products valued at N$1.9 billion (CIF) were imported between 1995-99. The major imports are paper and paperboard, printed matter, fibreboard, Chipwood, sawnwood and roundwood. Roundwood and sawnwood are important for the construction industry, which cannot meet consumption from local resources. Table 7a: Imports of wood products 1995-1999 value in CIF N$.

(Data source: Planning Commission Secretariat) The consumption trends of a few selected imported products (Table 8) used in the construction industry, such as fibreboard, plywood, and sawnwood, are briefly analysed below. The 1999 figures are for Jan-Jun only. The Projected 1999 figures mentioned in the following descriptions are projections based on the reported Jan-Jun 1999 data, which were multiplied by 2.05.
Fibreboard: starting with 1412 tons in 1995 the quantity increased by 123.6% to 3157 metric tons in 1996. From 1996 to 1997 the amount decreased by -55.7% to 1397 tons. From 1997 to 1998 the quantity decreased by -0.8% to 1386 tons. The projected 1999 figure is 1367 tons. There seems to be a declining fibreboard consumption trend. Plywood: Consumption increased by 411.3% from 88 tons in 1995 to 450 tons in 1996. From 1996 to 1997 the amount increased by 127.3% from 450 tons to 1023 tons. In addition, from1997 to 1998 the quantity increased by 127.6% to 2329 tons. There seems to be an increasing consumption trend in plywood between 1995 and 1998. The projected 1999 figure is 600 tons. Sawnwood: Sawnwood is used by the construction and furniture industry. Hard sawnwood 3 3 decreased by -48.4percentage from 1232 m in1995 to 636 m in 1996. From 1996, it increased 3 3 by 7% to 683 m . From 1997, the amount increased by 182.8% to 1929 m . The projected 1999 3 consumption is 701 m . There seems to be an up-and-down trend in hard sawnwood consumption. On the other hand Soft sawnwood increased by 17.3% from 3307 m in 1995 to 3880 m in 1996. 3 From 1996, the amount increased by 5.8% to 4106 m in 1997. Moreover, from 1997 the amount 3 3 increased by 70% to 6984 m in 1998. The projected 1999 consumption is 8725 m . There is a steady increasing trend in the consumption of soft sawnwood.

kilograms. A conversion factor of 1 m of wood = 0.725 Tons was used to derive the cubic meters. 3 m Exports The Directorate of Forestry maintains records of export permits issued to exporters of wood products. A computerised Forest Permit System was established in December 1999 at the Directorate of Forestry Head Office to capture data from forest permits on wood products traded. This is a significant step towards the directorate's efforts to improve forestry data collection and reporting. A similar step will need to be taken by other institutions involved in forestry data collection so that their data can be fed into the Directorate of Forestry Forest Permit data base. In this way, a much more realistic and reliable picture of trade in wood products in Namibia would emerge. Table 8 shows wood products exports obtained from permit issues at the Directorate of Forestry. On the other hand Tables 9a and 9b show exports based on the data from Central Bureau of Statistics.

(Data source: Planning Commission Secretariat) Wood products worth N$314.3 million were exported between 1997-99. Namibia is exports a significant amount of charcoal. 25700 tons valued at N$23.6 million were exported between 199799. Most of the other wood products seem to be re-exports of imported wood products, that is goods in transit through Namibia to other countries. Appendices 2 to 5 show wood products imports and exports by country, imported from, and exported to. The neighbouring Republic of South Africa is the major trading partner.

(Data source: Planning Commission Secretariat) 2.6 The most important wood-industries presently active in the country.
Appendix 1 shows the companies engaged in wood products trade in Namibia. The main wood industries in the forestry sector are Amalgamated Commercial holdings (AMCOM) and Development Brigade Corporation (DBC). AMCOM produces indigenous sawntimber for use in its furniture factory. DBC produces indigenous sawntimber for sale to other companies. Production and consumption figures for these companies were not readily accessible.

Evaluation of the data collected and the methodology used.
Evaluation and assessment of the reliability of the currently available information on wood-products Overall, the available limited data provides an indication of the state of the wood products consumption and trade in Namibia. The little data available is certainly better than no data at all. It is not easy to give figures on the accuracy of the data. However, when looking at these data the following points must be borne in mind: (1) Some of these data are based on surveys which may not be representative. For example, some of the data on firewood is based on a survey carried out in June 1996 mainly in the northern regions of the country. The town surveyed were Windhoek, Ondangwa, Oshakati, Ongwediva and Rundu. The southern regions were not included in the survey. The data are therefore not representative of the country. The data from the Directorate of Forestry Permit system and other official statistics may not reflect the true quantities exported or imported. An exporter's permit, for example, indicates the quantity the exporter is allowed to export, but since, for example, the firewood or charcoal weight is not verified by the relevant authorities either at the point of loading or at the border exit, the reported figures may be under- or over- statements from the actual figures. Presently this error is unknown. There seems to be some inconsistencies in the Import/Export data from Customs and Excise. E.g., increase in sawnwood imports from 85,445 Kg in 1997 to 500,190,735 Kg in 1998. This can be due to some mistyping errors when entering data from the Customs forms, e.g. 5,190,735 typed as 500,190,735. There might be double reporting of data. People obtaining export permits at forestry may have reported the same quantities to Customs and Excise. There is an apparent inconsistency that Namibia exports wood products. There is confusion between export and import data in that the same wood product categories imported are exactly the same as those exported. Namibia does not produce most of the wood products reported as exported (Tables 9a and 9b). The CBS expressed reservations regarding the accuracy and reliability of the import/export data. The data needs to be verified for typing errors, coding errors and other errors. (5) The categorisation of items exported/imported into the major categories such as Household and Sanitary, Newsprint, Paper and Paperboard, Particleboard, Wrapping and Packaging etc is source of error. In some cases, there is some doubt as to which category an item should be assigned. There is need to agree on itemisation into categories by all relevant authorities.
Strengths and weaknesses in the existing system of national data collection, analysis and dissemination. There is no existing system of national data collection, analysis and dissemination. However, the following points may be considered as advantages towards the development of a system for statistics on wood products: (1) Various institutions are engaged in trade and utilisation of wood products (See Appendix 1). These companies record their production data, which is not readily accessible to the public. These organisations need to be surveyed periodically. There are several institutions collecting data on wood products in Namibia. They have both the manpower capacity and equipment. The organisations directly involved in forestry data collection are: Ministry of Environment and Tourism (Directorate of Forestry). The Directorate of Forestry is the main institution responsible for forestry development in Namibia. It has the Forest Inventory and Mapping Section, which is involved in carrying out forest inventory. There is also the National Remote Sensing Centre engaged in various projects related to forestry data collection. However, these sections do not collect data on production, consumption and trade of wood products. The Directorate of Forestry has established a Permit System at the Windhoek District Forestry Office to capture data from issues of forest permits. Similar subsystems will be set up shortly at Grootfontein and Ongwediva Forestry Offices to feed into the System at Windhoek. The Directorate of Forestry, through its Forest Permit System has made an initial step towards the improvement of forestry statistics in Namibia. Ministry of Trade and Industry (Import/Export Permits). They have the data on the companies dealing commercially in wood products. Ministry of Finance (Customs and Excise). They record data on imports/exports and forward it to national Planning Commission Secretariat. National Planning Commission Secretariat (Central Bureau of Statistics). One of the duties of the Secretariat is co-ordinating data collection, processing and dissemination. (NDP1 1995/1996-1999/2000). They store the data, from Customs & Excise, on wood products imports and exports with a view to analyse it for national planning purposes.
The main weakness is that there is no existing co-ordinated system of national data collection, analysis and dissemination involving all the above institutions to compile the information into one comprehensive document, say annually, for users. Consequently, at present it is not easy to obtain a publication providing information on wood products consumption, imports/exports, trade etc. in Namibia. In the case of the Directorate of Forestry, most of the data on wood production is recorded in the form of correspondence. Some correspondence has been misfiled making it difficult to access the information.
How data is used and disseminated to other related agencies, to the public, press, etc.
Now there is no single publication on wood products statistics in Namibia. The various organisations engaged in the collection of forestry data do not publish this information. In the case of the Directorate of Forestry, information from the Permit System is incorporated into the annual reports, which are disseminated to various government ministries and other interested organisations. In addition, if any forestry data is to be released to the press this is done through the ministry's Public Relations Office.
Improvements of National Forestry Statistics Process.
The data already collected such as the statistics on the status of standing forest resources and from the forest permit system is being used to make informed predictions or to project future trends based on economic forecasts, population etc. For example, this information has been used in the preparation of the Second National Development Plan (NDPII). National Forestry statistics on wood products have not been systematically and periodically reported in Namibia. Therefore, a process needs to be started to improve the collection and compilation of National Forestry Statistics. Appendix 1 shows the list of companies dealing with wood products in the country. Data on wood products production, consumption and trade must be collected systematically from these institutions. A centralised system of national data collection, analysis and dissemination must be established.
Proposed practical, cost effective, measures for improvement of data collection, data processing and regular dissemination of statistics related to wood-products. The following are some measures that should be considered towards the improvement of data collection, data processing and regular dissemination of statistics related to wood products: (1) Ministry of Trade & Industry, Ministry of Finance (Customs and Excise) and National Planning Commission (Central Statistics Bureau) should have databases for the capture of forestry data. The Directorate of Forestry must become the focal point for regular data processing and regular dissemination of statistics related to wood-products in Namibia. It should design specific forms for recording wood products data from other institutions that are engaged in the collection of wood products data. These relevant ministries/institutions should periodically complete and forward the forms to the Directorate of Forestry. On the other hand, the Directorate of Forestry should obtain copies of the digital data from the above institutions for analysis. In view of item 2 above, there will be need for a full time official in the Directorate of Forestry to follow up this exercise to ensure that the forms are indeed completed and returned to forestry and the data entered into the forestry data base and analysed. The Chamber of Commerce (Companies dealing in wood products) should be consulted and their co-operation sought about the need to systematically and periodically report on.
wood products produced and traded in their companies. This information is beneficial to them because it will eventually show their contribution to the forestry sector, which in turn contributes to the Namibian economy. Send out a questionnaire regularly to the dealers in wood products (Appendix 1). This list needs to be updated. This contact will enable and facilitate the sharing of important technical and trade information with the wood products dealers to create a friendly relationship which is good for data collection. (5) The Directorate of Forestry should produce annually a publication on Wood-Products Statistics in Namibia. This document should provide statistics of the whole forestry sector. How these proposals can be integrated into the existing organisation.
A forest Official should be appointed to periodically liase with other organisations/ministries involved in collection of forestry data. A committee, chaired by Directorate of Forestry, should be set up comprising of officials from relevant organisations so that they can meet regularly to exchange views on forestry data collection, compilation and dissemination. They can also form the editorial board for the publication Wood-Products Statistics in Namibia. An expanded wood products database to capture all other wood products statistics currently not covered by the Forest Permit System should be created at the Directorate of Forestry. The new system must be designed in such a way that it is able to store data from other institutions and is easier to retrieve the information to produce the Wood-Products Statistics in Namibia being a publication in some agreed format. In this way, the information can be quickly disseminated to the public. The designated Forestry official could collect the raw data from the participating relevant institutions and enter it into the forestry wood products database. The Forest Inventory and Mapping Section, the Windhoek District Forestry Office (hosting the Forest permit System) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) are the possible candidates to easily play a role in the data capture, analysis and dissemination of wood products information. The data capture and processing can be handled by the Forest Inventory/Mapping Section and the Windhoek District Forestry Office while production of wood products information in map and other graphic form can be handled by the National Remote Sensing Centre.

FAO's Yearbook on Forest Products.
There is no data reported for Namibia in the FAO's Yearbook on Forest Products on the FE Website. Therefore, it is not possible to review or comment. It is expected that based on this review the next FAO Yearbook on Forest Products will contain some data on Namibia.
Appendix 1: List of wood products manufacturers.
Availability of statistics on production, consumption and trade of wood products in Namibia is scanty and to a certain extent non-existent. Presently, there is no systematic and routine national mechanism in place for collection and regular dissemination of wood products statistics in Namibia. Therefore, there is a need to set up such a system. The Directorate of Forestry has made a start towards improvements in this area through the established Forest Permit System. The Forest Permit System captures data from permits issued by the Directorate of Forestry officials. However, there is need for wider collaboration with and participation of other stakeholders, both private and government institutions, involved in data collection of wood products, in order to develop a complete and reliable picture of wood products production, consumption and trade in the country. There is a need for, and it is therefore recommended to carry out, a comprehensive survey of institutions dealing with wood products in the country to reliably ascertain the quantities and values of wood products traded. It seems that presently, private institutions are reluctant to providing information to individuals. An officially organised survey would yield more results that are useful. The data collected must be analysed and interpreted in a user-friendly manner to enable laymen to easily understand it. The analysis should include information mainly in two parts: trade in locally produced wood products; and trade in imported/exported wood products. The data on locally produced wood products should include their quantities and prices, production capacities and actual production of the various wood products dealers in the country, the different categories of wood products dealers and their estimated contribution to the forestry sector etc. The data on imported/exported wood products must critically analyse products actually produced in Namibia and exported, wood products imported and not locally produced, wood products that are reexported etc. Only in this way will a clear picture of the contribution of the forestry sector to the Namibian economy emerge.

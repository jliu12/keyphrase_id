Summary
Summary
The study looked at women organizations in the Brufut and Gunjur communities with the aim of determining their objectives, the relationship between and problems within the groups, technical assistance needs of the groups, their credit needs and associated problems, their access to equipment, and the utilization of their revenue
Thirteen organizations were studied, 6 from Brufut and 7 from Gunjur - two coastal towns in the Western Division of The Gambia The population of the two towns combined is 18,627 of which women constitute 50 percent
The major conclusions from the study are:
Group Relationship
Generally, the women tend to come together on the basis of a common objective to empower themselves. The strategies applied are the fostering of unity, improving their living standard, and increasing their income.
The bigger organizations tend to have a more complete structure than the smaller ones While the smaller ones have only a President and Vice president, the bigger ones have President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Social Secretary.
The sizes of these organizations range from 20 to 500 members. The most common criterion for membership of these organizations is to be female. Most of the organizations also require a membership fee For eight of the organizations studied, the membership fee ranges from D5.00 to D50. 00. An exceptional membership fee of D100.00 is charged by the Brufut Women Fish Smokers and Driers Kafo (a mandinka word for organization) of 36 women. In some cases, having exemplary character is demanded for membership.
All the year round activities occupy 92 percent of the organizations Of this number 76 percent work as a group and 24 percent as individuals within the framework of an organization.
Written records of activities and decisions are kept by 46 percent of the organizations. Most of these, with sizes from 175 to 500 members, are from Brufut This indicates that bigger organizations with complete structures keep written records of activities and decisions.
Problems encountered
All the organizations covered encounter problems. These range from inadequate implements, lack of capital, to lack of transport. Those with severe implement problem constitute 62 percent, those suffering from a lack of capital, 30 percent, and those with transport shortage, 8 percent.
Finance and Credit
Contributions from members finance 68 percent of the organizations. The rest are financed through trade (petty trading, 8%, and sale of produce, 8%), NGO funds (8%), and membership fees (8%)
All the organizations need credit But none of them had access to credit because it was either not available or the procedures for access are not known. Inability to get access to the credit institutions or agencies was reported by 76 percent of them. If they were to receive credit, 92 percent prefer group loan and 8 percent as individuals. The desired use for the credit has been expressed as increasing production (61%), buying more materials for their activities (23%), solving managerial problems (8%), and meeting production targets (8%)
In order to fill the gap in financing their activities, they engage in traditional fund raising. Traditional methods like drumming and kora (24 string Gambian musical instrument) shows are applied by 54 percent of the organizations The revenue realised is used to buy equipment, materials, and to conduct maintenance
Savings is practiced by some of the organizations. At least 54 percent are involved. Of these 72% save with the International Bank for Commerce and Industry (BICI) and 28% with the traditional scheme ("Osusu") That indicates that either the BICI is more readily accessible to the women or they trust it more than the local scheme The money saved is used as soft loan to members, as contingency funds, and for maintenance work. Apart from the savings, many of the organizations receive financial assistance either in cash or in kind At the time of the study 2 received financial assistance from the EEC, I in kind from the Christian Children's Fund (CCF), and 3 received assistance in kind from the Women's Bureau and the Department of Community Development.
Conclusion
The study indicates that women do organize themselves in various groups to address their needs and aspirations. Each of the organizations has clearly defined objectives. In achieving the objectives they encounter management problems and little or no access to resources.
Recommendations
o A specially designed management training for members of the executives in the various women's organizations is essential to ensure an effective and sustainable structure
o Target small group members for training on simple accounting, record keeping, and business management skills in the local language
o Assist the organization by creating awareness on how to reach the relevant agencies for assistance.
o Fund raising activities should be encouraged to enable groups to finance their activities locally
o Groups should be encouraged to save to ensure sustainability of activities.
o Deep wells should be provided to supply water for all year round activities
o Provide appropriate technology for preservation of fish and garden produce. Train the members on the techniques
o Create marketing outlets, proper storage facilities, and suitable sheds for selling fish to passersby at strategic locations along the roads.
o Adequate and suitable materials relevant to the group's activities should be provided in consultation with the organizations to encourage their participation in their development.
o Create a system to sensitize women's organizations on avenues to secure loans.
o Nutritional education programmes should be directed to groups that are working on improving nutritional standards
o Provide funding to groups and individuals and monitor the utilization for effective management
o Provide improved delivery systems such as good roads for transportation of goods to markets.
o Short term technical assistance should be provided to the organizations.

Summary of Findings for Brufut and Gunjur Women's Organizations
Summary of Findings for Brufut and Gunjur Women's Organizations
The study looked at women organizations in the communities of Brufut and Gunjur with a view to determine their objectives, the relationship between and problems within the groups, technical assistance needs, credit needs and the problems associated with the group credit schemes, access to equipment for their work and utilization of revenue
A total of thirteen organizations were studied, six from Brufut and seven from Gunjur, which are two coastal towns in the Western Division of The Gambia. The population of the two towns is eighteen thousand six hundred and twenty seven. In both communities women constitute fifty percent of the population.
The most important conclusions arising from this study are as follows:
Overall, women tend to come together, based on their common objectives to empower themselves These objectives range from fostering unity, improving their standard of living to increasing their income
In terms of structure, the bigger organisations tend to have a more complete structure than the smaller ones. While the smaller organisations have only a president and Vice president, the bigger organisations have president, Vice president, treasurer and social secretary.
The overall sizes of these organizations under study range from 20 to 500 members A common criteria which emerged from both Brufut and Gunjur communities is that to become a member of the organization you must be a female. In addition to that most of the organisations require a membership fee. Eight out of the thirteen organizations studied require a membership fee ranging from D5. 00 to D50. 00. An exceptional membership fee of D 100 00 is charged by the Brufut Women Fish Smokers and Driers Kafo which has a membership of 36 women. Some of the organizations also have qualitative criteria e.g. 'exemplary character' as an additional requirement for membership.
Ninety two percent (92%) of the organizations are involved in their respective activities all the year round and seventy percent of these organizations work as a group while twenty two percent work individually within the framework of an organisation.
The study shows that more than half (54 percent) of the organisations do not keep any written record of their activities and decisions while forty six percent (46%) do. Most of the organisations that keep written records came mostly from Brufut with sizes ranging from 175 to 500 members. The study thus seem to suggest that organisations with a complete structure tend to keep written records of their activities and decisions.

This study seems to suggest that none of the organizations has access to credit facilities. This is because credit facilities were either not available or the procedures to access them are not known. All the organizations interviewed have expressed the need for credit facilities. The overwhelming number of these organizations prefer this credit be given out to them as a group (92%) whiles (8%) of them prefer the credit individually All the organizations have indicated the willingness to repay the loan if given credit. Sixty-one percent of these organizations need credit to increase production, 15% to buy more materials for their activities, 8% to improve on their managerial problems, 8% to meet their production targets, and 8% to increase the purchase of their materials.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of an organization's structure is to establish a formal system of roles that people can perform so that they may best work together to achieve common objectives. The study has also shown how organization structures and their levels are due to the limitations of the span of management The exact number of people a manager can effectively supervise depends on a number of underlying variables and situations The larger groups do not save collectively and their membership to the organization is loose Entrepreneuring and intrapreneuring seem to be the common objective of groups' cohesiveness. The study has demonstrated the logic of organizing into groups and relationship to group objective as an empowering structure. These organizations also serve as socialising outlets in working groups greatly handicapped by the low literacy rates of these women, and therefore the achievements of these organizations seem quite limited
The study also revealed the fragmentation of similar organizations with the same objectives and activities, but difference in size and scope. The reasons given for the existence of similar organizations working parallel in the same community can be attributed to political and class based factors, which on further probing was considered sensitive. However, the loose organizational structure is a good beginning for emerging rural women organizations as they learn to engage in team-work to achieve their objectives. The study seems to prove that people will work together most effectively if they cooperate and know the part they are to play in any team operation
All the organizations studied have manifested gender sensitivity in terms of women organising themselves to address their common problems despite the problems they encounter in the whole process. This in itself is empowering.
These women organizations in the communities have a clear idea of the major duties or activities they are involved in, understood areas of discretion or authority and what they can do to accomplish goals. Their success emanates from the fact that they are able to organize themselves to address their vulnerabilities.
However to make a role work out effectively, provision should be made for supplying needed information and other tools necessary for performance in that toil
A Programme should be designed to make sure that activities fit together, so that these organizations work smoothly, effectively, and efficiently in groups and as individuals in their respective communities The structure must furnish an environment in which individual performance, both present and future, contributes most effectively to group goals.

3. Focus group discussions
3. Focus group discussions
SUMMARY OF FINDING OF GUNJUR AND BRUFUT WOMEN GROUP DISCUSSIONS
The focus group discussions for Brufut were held in a forum chaired by one of the Lady Presidents of the six women groups in Brufut The Gunjur women focus discussions took place in the compound of the head of one of the seven organisations. This chapter summarises the salient issues which were raised during the group discussions Various speakers at both group discussions raised, basically, the same issues. During the group discussions various speakers deliberated on the aims and objectives of their organisation The most important of all during the group discussions was the highlights on the constraints ranging from administrative bottlenecks to inadequate working capital for groups, as well as lack of co-ordinated mechanism for their groups The summary of the findings from both group discussions is as follows:
Generally, all the organisations lack an appropriate storage facility. The produce of these women organisations are mostly perishable goods, for example, tomatoes, vegetables and fresh fish. The organisations are vulnerable to losses, particularly when they could not sell all the goods taken to the market. Since the storage facility is not available, the goods spoil and this results in huge losses of income to the individuals and the organisations
There is lack of coordination among the organisations. The neighbouring communities, such as Sukuta, Madiana, to name a few, have women organisations engaged in the same activities carried out by the organisations in Brufut and Gunjur. That creates a glut of fish and vegetables to the extend that one is forced to sell at a loss. This could have been avoided if an appropriate coordination exists among the organisations.
The road from Brufut and Gunjur to Greater Banjul Area where the goods are transported to for sale at the market is in a poor state. This coupled with the scarcity of vehicles that ply these roads could delay one for hours on end to look for a vehicle to transport the goods to the market. In the process, most of the perishable goods go bad, thus resulting in huge loss of income to individuals and to the organisations
All the organisations have mentioned the need for one sort of training or the other.
It was very obvious that these groups lack managerial skills in administration, loan management and so on. Organisations in the cottage industry for instance, Tie and Dye, identified the need to be trained in modern technology in order to produce quality and quantity Tie and Dye. All the other organisations have identified management training need to improve the management skill of the organisation's members.
Working Capital for most of the organisations is grossly inadequate. The organisations depended on the meagre resources contributed by the members and the occasional assistance from NGOs and Government Departments. This has resulted in the low level of productivity and low capacity to expand and generate more income.
From the discussions, it can been seen that the major constraints of the organisations have been the lack of management skills, inadequate working capital, and the difficulties encountered during the transportation of their goods to market. These constraints have been echoed by one speaker after another The groups welcomed efforts by Government or NGOs to help alleviate some, if not all, the constraints

4. The Views Of Men About The Women Organisations
4. The Views Of Men About The Women Organisations
The organisations under study are women only organisations This chapter contains the interviews on the views of eight men about the Women organisations chosen at random in the
Gunjur and Brufut communities The men are in the sub-sector in which the organisations studied are engaged but do not belong to any of the women organisations in this study. The interviews focus on the divergent views whether or not these women organisations should include men. My first respondent was Nyakassi Saidy, a retired extension worker who is now in the artisanal fishing industry He is of the view that Women Kaffos or organisations should include men His views were expressed as follows
.. women Kaffos should incorporate men as members This will foster unity among the two sexes in the community Women should no longer uphold the traditional norm or values that men are the driving force among them. Rather, they should see men as Co-partners in development in any multi sex organisation set-up. This, I believe could bring about increased productivity which enhances sustainability - an integral part of modern development.
My second respondent was Malafy Jammeh of Gunjur, a driver closely associated with the fishing industry. This respondent is of the opinion that women organisations should be left as they are and shouldn't include men Malafy has his reasons:
...ours is a tradition where men still dominate women which is yet to be influenced In any organisation where one sex dominate the other the tendency is that dominant sexes productivity is adversely influenced. Women organisations should be left on their own in order to achieve their long desires of independence from social cultural. traditional and economic frustrations
The third respondent was Mr. Faburama Barrow, a tailor also from Gunjur Mr. Barrow is of the opinion that women organisations should include men According to him
... men and women coming together under one umbrella organisation would only result in solidarity Common issues that concern both genders are better discussed in that sort of an organisation This fosters better understanding of strategies to follow to solve problems which enhance the overall organisational objectives. Men and Women working together can only bring about effectiveness and sustainable development effort.
My fifth respondent, Bajamba Bojang, is the community leader of Brufut who also works in the fishing industry. Mr. Bojang thinks that women and men coming together in one organisation could bring development The detail of his comments is given:
...men who are generally more dynamic than their women counterparts could be instrumental to women productivity. The women organisations lack the managerial skills that affects their viability, sustainability and to a larger extend progress. With men joining these organisations, the organisation would be better managed to be able to attract funds from supporting institutions and Government.
The sixth respondent was Mr. Paul Momodou Gassama, driver from Brufut whose second occupation is gardening. He strongly believes that women organisations are not doing badly and therefore the composition should be left as it is. According to him:
... the African woman, particularly the Gambian woman, is very industrious and highly committed to improving the living standards of their families. If men and women should come together in one organisation men will always dominate the women. In this way the women who work harder do not participate effectively in taking the decisions on matters that affect them.
The seventh respondent, Momodou Ceesay, also comes from Brufut He grows and sells groundnuts for a living. He too is of the opinion that women organisations shouldn't include men. His reasons are given below.
... although the women organisations lack the necessary managerial skills and financial support they work extremely hard at both individual and organisational levels in the horticulture and fisheries sectors. The men folks are generally lazy, always appealing for some donor assistance. Women organisations should be left on their own and be suported.
The final respondent was Alagi Manneh, a driver from Brufut. He is closely associated with the fishing industry. He also prefers women organisations to be left as they are. He argued that:
...a multi sex organisation in a traditional society as ours where men dominate
women often results in an undemocratic set-up in the structure of the organisation Key positions within the organisation get occupied by the men relegating women to the background in the decision making process. The existing women organisations should only be strengthened through capacity building in the form of training, financial aid from Government or NGOs, rather than change their composition.
CONCLUSION
The views expressed by the respondents are diverse, but the momentum seems to gather around the fact that women organisations can do better without changing the composition. In a traditional society where men dominate the women, the women organisations should be encouraged to stay as they are in order to exercise independence in decision making on matters that affect women. Government and donor assistance in the capacity building, in the form of training and financial aid, could go a long way into empowering the women by turning the organisations into sustainable and viable organisations

The vision for IDAF phase Ill
The vision for IDAF phase Ill
INTRODUCTION
Development strategy during the 1960 and 1970s was based on the philosophy that developing countries lacked improved technology and capital for speeding up their development. Industrialization was promoted in order to capitalize on the abundant fish resources. However, the anticipated expansion of the economy did not happen and the development approach shifted towards an integrated rural strategy where emphasis is put on the community as a whole to upgrade incomes and the quality of life through technical assistance and the active participation of fisherfolk and the community.
In this context, emphasis was initially placed on the Community Fishery Centre (CFC) concept as a means of promoting artisanal fishery development. But it became apparent that the presence of a complex of facilities and services tailored to meet local needs was no guarantee that the structures/facilities would be used or that development would occur. The active participation of fisherfolk and the mobilization of local and community resources was imperative in order to assure sustainability of initiatives undertaken by development projects and/or the community.
So far and in general terms, the IDAF Programme has worked under the context of abundant or seemingly adequate fishery resources with moderate population pressure. The scenario is however changing (and very fast for that matter) and we would soon face the triple constraints of reduced or depleting fish stocks, degrading environment and increasing population pressure. Like in other sectors, it must be anticipated that just to survive, parts of the population surplus in the fishing communities will enter the artisanal fisheries, which will increase the competition for the resources among the small scale fisherfolk in addition to the prevailing competition between the artisanal and industrial fisheries, with their attendant effect on the environment.
This scenario calls for a continuation of the integrated participatory strategy which remains relevant to the development of artisanal fisheries in West Africa. However, the emphasis needs to be placed on the elements and mechanisms that favour the sustainability of initiatives: responsible fishing, the empowerment processes that ensure the devolution of major resource management and development decisions to the local community, the strengthening of national human and institutional capacities at all levels for a sustainable and equitable fisheries resources management and development, as well as in the follow-up and consolidation of past achievements.
DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
Thus the development objective of the Programme in the present phase Ill which started on I July 1994 is to ensure twenty coastal West African countries a sustainable development and management of their artisanal fisheries for maximum social and economic benefit of their fishing communities in terms of employment, proteins and earnings. This will be done through an integrated and participatory approach in which emphasis will be laid on equity, gender issues, the transfer of technology for development, environment protection, as well as the strengthening of human and institutional capacities.
The immediate objectives are:
1 . To identify and disseminate strategies and mechanisms for sustainable management and development of the artisanal fisheries in fishing communities;
2. To improve the competence of national Fisheries Departments staff in development and management planning of artisanal fisheries;
3. To enhance regional technical competence in the fisheries disciplines, particularly in fishing and fish technology;
4. To improve information and experience exchange related to artisanal fisheries within the region;
5. To promote regional and sub-regional collaboration for the development and management of artisanal fisheries
In this context, IDAF will among other things tackle the following major aspects it's work:
o assisting in the elaboration and implementation of a clear and coherent national development policy for the artisanal fishery sector,
o providing advice on management and allocation of resources between artisanal and industrial fishing fleets, both national and foreign,
o involving users in the design and management of on shore infrastructures,
o monitoring the sector's evolution by the setting up of an economic indicator system for the sector adapted to the financial and human availabilities;
o improving fishing technologies in accordance with the available resources,
o increasing the final product's value by improvement in processing and marketing,
o promoting community development in accordance with the lessons learned from Phase I and II and oriented towards the sustainability of actions undertaken,
o reinforce the Programme's information/communication system.
It is anticipated that by the end of the third phase of the Project, the region will have a nucleus of field oriented experts capable to respond to the challenges of the artisanal fisheries sector and to spur development in their individual countries in keeping with the aspirations and needs of fisherfolk.

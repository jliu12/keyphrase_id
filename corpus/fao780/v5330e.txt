<title>The farming systems approach to development and appropriate technology generation</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
This manual on the farming systems approach to technology development is based on the experiences of the authors over the last two decades. Much of the documentation of these experiences has occurred over the last five years with the production of three sets of documents on the methodology for undertaking the farming systems research approach. These were a!; follows:
* The production of a farming systems research manual for Botswana [Worman, Norman et al, 19901 which was first published under the auspices of the Department of Agricultural Research in the Ministry of Agriculture in Botswana. A slightly revised edition was later printed in 1992 by courtesy of the Food and Agricultural Organisation/Swedish International Development Agency (FAO/SIDA) sponsored Farming Systems Programme headquartered in Gaborone. Botswana.
* A series of lectures given at Mahalapye Rural Training Centre, Botswana, in May 1992 at a Fanning Systems Research In-Service Training Course for Research and Extension Staff in the Ministry of Agriculture
* A series of lectures given as part of a Sustainable Farming Systems Course at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SUAS). Uppsala, Sweden in November 1992, which resulted in a publication [Norman et al, 19941 produced by the FAO/SIDA project with its headquarters in Gaborone, Botswana.
Therefore, although the authors have been responsible for developing the current manual it is important to acknowledge the contributions made by many others in producing materials for the original handbook [Worman, Norman et al, 1990] including S. Bock, A. Caplan, G. Heinrich, C. Koketso, E. Makhwaje, S. Masikara, and N. Persaud. These materials have been used extensively in the current primer. Also, D. Baker deserves credit for quite a few of the ideas developed in the manual.
The authors also wish to express appreciation to the following:
* Dr. Lucas Gakale, Director of Agricultural Research, Ministry of Agriculture, Botswana for supporting the development of the original handbook.
* Mr. Gustav Boklin, SUAS, who coordinated the course in Uppsala and who encouraged the publication of a slightly modified version of the lecture notes, and Dr. Bo Gohl and the Steering Committee of the FAO/SIDA Farming Systems Programme who were responsible for the FAO/SIDA publication.
* Dr. Peter Hildebrand and Dr. John Russell, who kindly made available material from a book they are currently preparing on modified stability (i.e., adaptability) analysis.
* Mr. Lex Roeleveld and colleagues in the Lake Zone FSD team in Tanzania, who specially prepared one of the case studies in the manual relating to their experiences with farmer groups.
The intended audience for the material presented in this document is for those who wish to understand, and harness the power of, the principles of the FSD in the quest for developing relevant improved technologies for farmers, particularly those who have very limited resources,

1. Introduction
The farming systems approach to development (FSD) has two inter-related thrusts. One is to develop an understanding of the farm-household, the environment in which it operates, and the constraints it faces, together with identifying and testing potential solutions to those constraints, The second thrust involves the dissemination of the most promising solutions to other farmhouseholds facing similar problems. This manual primarily concentrates on procedures useful to FSD personnel in addressing the first of these thrusts, particularly with respect to designing and developing relevant improved technologies.
The material presented in this manual primarily stems from work undertaken in Botswana and other countries, mainly in Africa. However, the authors have also benefited greatly from the experiences of individuals in other parts of the world and have illustrated these guidelines with examples from the work of others. The manual is divided into four major parts and a number of chapters within those parts. Briefly, these can be summarised as follows:
* Part I concentrates on the conceptual framework underlying the FSD approach. Major sections are devoted to the rationale and philosophy of the approach (Chapter 2), a description of the general approaches used in implementing FSD (Chapter 3) and a discussion of some of the key concepts underlying the approach (Chapter 4).
* Part II discusses the implementation of the FSD approach, with one major section devoted to the steps involved in its implementation (Chapter 5) and the other to some of the important operational issues that are involved in its implementation (Chapter 6).
* Part III, the biggest part, deals with methodological issues. It consists of four major sections relating to an overview of the data collection methods used in implementing the FSD approach (Chapter 7), followed by a more detailed discussion on survey (Chapter 8) and trial (Chapter 9) techniques. In Part III, most of the emphasis is placed on data collection rather than analysis and evaluation, for which many references are available, particularly concerning the technical areas. However, the last major section (Chapter 10) does deal with certain aspects of analysis and evaluation that are less familiar to those on FSD teams who come from a technical science background.
* Part IV, which consists of the appendices, has three components. Appendix A I provides a list of references relating to the methodology and implementation of the FSD approach. This list is divided into two parts, The first part consists of those cited in the text, However, because this is not an exhaustive list of papers on FSD. the second part consists of other useful references, not cited in the text, to provide a foundation on which the reader can build a more in-depth knowledge, Appendix A2 defines the acronyms used in the guidelines. Appendix A3 deals with the measurement of plant stands and yields, two of the most critical agronomic variables that FSD activities usually have to address when directed to identification of relevant improved technologies,
To illustrate some of the major points in the manual ample use is made of examples of FSD activities throughout the world. These are usually presented in boxes in the text. However, because of their size, three case studies, one from Tanzania and two from Botswana, are presented in specific sections.
Part I - Conceptualising the farming systems development approach
The material in Part I is designed to provide background information that will be useful in placing the more technical discussion in Parts II and III on the implementation of the FSD approach in context.
Part I consists of three major chapters, dealing with:
* The rationale and philosophy underlying the FSD approach (Chapter 2).
* The general approaches used in the application of FSD (Chapter 3).
* Some key concepts involved in the application of FSD (Chapter 4).
2. Rationale and philosophy of the farming systems development approach
2.1 Objectives of the chapter
The objectives of this chapter are to:
* Describe briefly the reasons why the FSD approach evolved.
* Look at the differences between station-based research and farm-based FSD.
* Describe briefly the process and interactive nature of agricultural development.
FSD grew out of, and is closely related to, the farming systems research (FSR) methodology. In order to fully understand FSD with respect to technology generation, it is useful to examine the development of FSR.
2.2 Evolution of the FSD approach
In the mid-1960's, there was little interaction between technical scientists (who were mostly on experiment stations) and social scientists (who tended to be concentrated in planning units). The Green Revolution was beginning to have a great deal of success in Asia and Latin America, being based on good climate (i.e., plenty of water) and soils; very homogeneous and favourable production environments; and the adoption of Improved varieties of wheat, maize, and rice that were very responsive to fertilizer. Improved inputs also were readily available and there was an accessible market for the products. However, in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, and certain parts of Latin America and Asia, there has been no Green Revolution. This is because climatic conditions are often not as favourable (i.e., too much or too little rainfall and limited amounts of irrigation), soils are generally poor, production environments are very heterogeneous and poor, and the input and output markets are
poorly developed. Not surprisingly, there has been great difficulty in developing improved technologies that are attractive to farmers in such areas.
In Green Revolution areas, farmers were able to benefit from the improved technologies even if they did not do things quite right and the inputs they used were very divisible (e.g., they could use a little or a lot of improved fertilizer or seed). However, in areas with less hospitable environments (e.g., low rainfall areas that are found in many countries in Africa and Latin America), farmers have to do things exactly right if they are to benefit (e.g., planting on good soil moisture) and also they need lumpy inputs (e.g., control over traction). In addition, yield increases are not so good -- they tend to involve incremental rather than major (i.e. revolutionary) changes in yields.
Thus, in the Green Revolution areas, because of the spectacular nature of the technology, experiment-station based technical scientists were very successful in their work. However, the lack of success in using a similar approach in poorer agricultural areas (i.e., with resource poor farmers), led to the evolution of the FSR approach, in which there is close cooperation between technical and social scientists. Work done with farmers in various countries in the 1960's and early 1970's revealed that these limited-resource farmers [Norman, 1993]:
* Are rational (i.e., sensible) in the methods they use. For example, in Africa, there was little support for station-based research on mixed cropping until the early 1970's. although earlier farm-based research had revealed the rationality of the practice [Norman, 1974].
* Are natural experimenters [Biggs and Clay 1981]. Obviously, the methods farmers naturally use will be those that appeal to them and are informal in nature [Lightfoot, Bottrall et al, 1991] in the sense that they are not usually amenable to formal statistical analysis.
* Understand the environment in which they operate rather complex farming systems, consisting of crops, livestock, and off-farm enterprises [Norman et al, 1981]. In fact, it could be asserted that such systems are often more complex than the specialized farming systems found in many high income countries. Unlike the case with limited resource farmers in low income countries, many of the constraints in specialized agriculture in high income countries can be broken or avoided through seeking advice and taking advantage of and receiving external help [Norman and Collinson, 1986].
Consequently, considerable respect developed for limited-resource farmers. The FSR approach evolved because of an increased awareness on the part of researchers that such farmers:
* Had a right to be involved in the technology development process, because they stood to gain or lose most from adoption of the technology.
* Could productively contribute to the development of appropriate improved technologies.
Therefore, the fundamental principle of FSR was that farmers could help in identifying the appropriate path to agricultural development. It is now recognized that limited resource farmers can be involved productively in all stages of the FSR approach. Farmers' participation at all stages relates in one way or the other to the selection, design, testing, and adoption of appropriate technologies.
FSR rapidly became popular and was strongly supported by many donor agencies. By the mid 1980s, about 250 medium- and long-term projects worldwide were carrying out FSD type work. As one of the major donors, USAID between 1978 and 1988 had funded 76 bilateral, regional, and centrally funded projects containing either a farming systems orientation or clearly focusing on farming systems type work. Forty-five of these were in Africa [Brown et al, 1988]. Now, many of those projects are being institutionalized within national programmes with considerable domestic financing.
Thus, the FSR approach evolved primarily as a result of a lack of success in developing relevant Improved technologies. The strong technical focus that characterised the evolution still persists to this day, although increasingly many, including FSD practitioners, are advocating that the approach can be used constructively in addressing not only technological solutions but also those relating to policy/support systems, a topic that will be considered further later in the manual (Sections 3.6 and 6.3.3).
In the mid-1980s, the Farm Management and Production Economics Service of FAO became actively involved in the farming systems movement and developed the FSD approach. FSD is based on the farm-household focus of FSR and emphasizes the central role the farmer plays in farming systems development. In addition, this approach incorporates an increased emphasis on the dissemination of improved farming systems based, in the process, on active involvement of those responsible for the policy/support systems. In the rest of the manual the term FSD will be used instead of FSR in order to avoid any possible confusion.
2.3 Comparing station-based research and FSD
The literature frequently compares and contrasts station-based research and FSD. The tone in such comparisons often implies that they are substitutes for each other. However, both station based research and farm-level FSD are needed. This is because they focus on different things that are complementary to each other.
A major difference between them is the following:
* On the experiment station, applied research is usually undertaken, in which new technologies are created.
* FSD, on the other hand, concentrates mainly on adaptive research, which involves helping to adjust technologies to specific environmental conditions. FSD also helps feed back information about future priorities for applied research to experiment stations.
Table 2.1 illustrates some of the major differences between station-based research and FSD and helps indicate why both are necessary, particularly in areas where the Green Revolution has not occurred. In such areas, greater attention will need to be paid to adaptive research, if relevant improved technologies are to be developed and adopted by farmers.
Figure 2.1: Process of agricultural development
Obviously, strong linkages between these various contributors are of crucial importance. The FSD approach, involving working directly with the farmers, is a more 'bottom-up' or 'micro to macro, orientation, compared with the more 'topdown, or 'macro to micro' orientation of research work or planning exercises that start at the experiment station or the upper levels of planning ministries. Part 'B' in Figure 2.1 indicates that FSD can help in strengthening 'bottom up' linkages amongst the various groups. In doing so, it helps in the process of improving productivity but does not result in a product by itself. (i.e., facilitates a process rather than producing a product).
As mentioned above, relevant improved practices/technologies and policy/support systems are needed to bring about increased agricultural productivity. Decisions on which strategy is to be emphasized to increase agricultural productivity will depend on circumstances. For example, if no technology is available to ensure an economic return to fertilizer, there will be little value in concentrating on developing an input distribution system that makes fertilizer available to farmers. Therefore' the complementary nature of the relationship between developing and disseminating relevant improved technologies and policy/support systems needs to be constantly borne in mind, if the agricultural development process is to proceed efficiently.
In the above discussion, it is apparent that the FSD approach has a broader focus than simply addressing technological issues -- the primary focus of early FSR activities. The FSD approach, can help also in facilitating linkages not only between farmers and station-based researchers but also with other 'actors,, including those responsible for designing and implementing the policy/support system. In fact, most work in the farming systems arena to date has concentrated on the technology thrust or farming systems activities relating to FSD. This manual concentrates most attention on the research or technology thrust of FSD although linkages with other 'actors' besides farmers and station-based researchers are discussed to some extent.
3. General approaches to the farming systems approach to development
3.1 Objectives of the chapter
The objectives of this chapter are as follows:
* Indicate the objective of FSD.
* Briefly describe the different stages of FSD.
* Briefly discuss evolutionary stages of FSR, here termed FSD.
* Outline some of the major characteristics of FSD, especially as it relates to technology development.
* Compare the system and reductionist approaches.
* Emphasise the broad applicability of the FSD approach,
* Indicate some of the challenges facing FSD.
3.2 Introduction to FSD
Details concerning the characteristics and methodology of the FSD approach, as developed by the Farm Management and Production Economics Service of FAO, are available elsewhere [FAO, 1989, 1990; Friedrich et al, 1994]. Thus, the following discussion represents only a brief summary.
The primary objective of FSD is to improve the well-being of individual farming families by increasing the overall productivity of the farming system in the context of both the private and societal goals, given the constraints and potentials imposed by the factors that determine the existing farming system. It is based on the development principles of improving productivity, increasing profitability, ensuring sustainability, and guaranteeing an equitable distribution of the results of production,
The farm household is the principal system and focus of FSD and consists of three basic subsystems, which are closely interlinked and interactive: the household, the farm, and off-farm activities. The two major categories of activities or thrusts of FSD, both of which involve intensive interaction with farmers? are:
* Farming Systems Analysis. This involves studying, together with the farmers the natural (i.e., technical) and socio-economic (i.e., human) environments in which farm households operate. The aim is to identify the constraints limiting farm productivity and production and hindering improvement in the welfare of the farm households themselves. Potential solutions to these problems are identified, and the results of this analysis, formulated as suggestions for further action then are passed on to the relevant 'actors'. These could include researchers, extension and support service staff, and/or policy makers.
* Farming Systems Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation. These involve testing, monitoring, and evaluating improvements on-farm, with the direct involvement of farmers. Examples of such activities include those regarding proposed technological improvements, proposed revisions in farm plans, and improvements in support services and farm-level impact of proposed policy changes. Those improvements thought to be potentially useful then are disseminated to other farmers via the extension service. Prior to this stage, it may be necessary to negotiate adjustments in the policy/support services that will facilitate the dissemination and adoption of the improvement. After dissemination, it is of primary importance to monitor and evaluate the adoption rate of the proposed improvements by the farming community. This provides an indication of the actual value of the improvement being disseminated.
Many individuals in the last 15 to 20 years have written extensively to clarity the concepts of the farming systems, particularly with respect to the development of relevant improved technologies. There are many ways of presenting a diagram involving the application of farming systems methodology to research (i.e., technology development). One such way of emphasizing the technical research aspects of FSD is in Figure 3.1 There are four fundamental stages in the FSD approach.
* The Descriptive or Diagnostic Stage, in which the actual farming system is examined in the context of the 'total, environment (see Section 4.2) -- to identify constraints farmers face and to determine the potential flexibility in the farming system in terms of timing, unused resources, etc. An effort also is made to understand the goals and motivation of farmers that may affect their efforts to improve the farming system,
Figure 3.1: Farming systems development
The following sequence of activities is usually undertaken:
* After deciding on the location of the work, start-up activities include reviewing secondary sources of information, making the necessary contacts, assembling the professional team, and making logistical arrangements,
* Farming families are classified tentatively into homogeneous groups. The farming families within each group or domain usually practice the same farming system(s), face the same constraints, and have the same potential solution(s) to their problems. This tentative classification can be modified as additional information becomes available.
* An informal exploratory diagnosis or survey is undertaken to obtain a qualitative understanding of the determinants of the existing farming systems (i.e., both biophysical and socioeconomic). At the same time, efforts are made with farmers to ascertain the constraints, flexibility, and potential opportunities in the farming systems they are using currently.
* Sometimes a verification survey involving a structured formal survey, suitable for statistical analysis, is undertaken to quantitatively confirm insights obtained in the exploratory diagnosis. It also can be used to provide a database for farm and development planning, policy analysis, monitoring, and evaluation.
* The Design Stage, in which a range of strategies is identified that are thought to be relevant in dealing with the constraints determined in the descriptive or diagnostic stage.
The usual sequence of activities involves the following:
* Together with the farmers, the constraints are ranked according to their severity, and potential solutions are identified after determining what flexibility exists in the farming systems currently practiced. Information for designing such strategies (i.e., particularly relating to technological issues) comes from experiment station work, researcher managed and researcher implemented (RMRI) type work on farmers' fields, and from other farmers.
* An evaluation is made of the proposed solutions before putting them into practice. These solutions can be technological or institutional in nature. A number of analytical techniques can be used to evaluate the potential technical feasibility? economic viability, social acceptability, and ecological sustainability of the proposed solutions before they are put into practice. One or more of the proposed solutions are selected for actual evaluation on-farm.
* The Testing and Implementation Stage, in which one or more promising strategies, arising from the design stage, are examined and evaluated under term conditions to determine their suitability for producing desirable and acceptable changes in the existing farming system.
Activities at this stage involve the following:
* On-farm testing or evaluation with farmers determining how well the potential improvements fit into the system, whether or not they are acceptable to farming households, and what modification may be needed to make them acceptable. In terms of technological issues, this stage conventionally has consisted of two steps:
-- Researcher managed but farmer implemented (RMFI) tests to establish whether previously determined technical relationships are altered by farmers' management of non-treatment variables.
-- Farmer managed and implemented (FMFI) tests, when the team is confident that technical relationships will hold but needs to evaluate the proposed technologies under local socio-economic circumstances. In addition to the on-farm evaluation of the proposed technologies, evaluations also can be made of the proposed farm plans and of proposed changes in support systems and/or policies.
* Positive results of such evaluations provide justification for the FSD team to advocate further action. The tested technologies can be disseminated through the extension service to other similar farming households, The same applies to the farm plans that have been tested successfully. Favourable test results for proposed changes in support services and/or policies provide valuable farm-level information on necessary programme or policy adjustments (e.g., in extension, marketing inputs and products, pricing policy, credit, etc).
* The Dissemination and Impact Evaluation Stage, in which the strategies that were identified and screened during the design and testing stages are extended to farmers. In terms of activities at this stage, impact/adoption studies can be very important. These potentially can be very useful, not only in giving some idea of the impact of, for example, agricultural research, but also in giving some idea of future priorities for agricultural researchers and indicating what adjustments are required in the policy/support systems to ensure better rates of adoption. Thus, through monitoring and evaluating the impact and rate of adoption of the changes that have been implemented and proposed/tested earlier, it is potentially possible to provide some indication of further desirable activities by both researchers and planners.
There are often no clear boundaries between the various stages, Design activity, for example, may begin before the descriptive and diagnostic stages and may continue into the testing stage, as promising alternatives emerge from RMFI trials. Similarly, testing by farmers may mark the beginning of dissemination activities.
Also, going through all stages may not always be necessary. FSD team confidence in transferability during design/planning activities can sometimes mean going straight to FMFI work or even to recommendation/dissemination activities. Thus, the process of FSD is recognized as being dynamic and iterative, with linkages in both directions between farmers, researchers, extension staff and policy/support service staff, The iterative characteristic can improve the efficiency of the development process by providing a means of identifying and fine tuning improved technologies for a specific location -that is, climatic situation, soil type, and/or farmer resource base.

3.3 Approaches within farming systems research
Because FSD has its roots in farming systems research, the following comments on approaches within FSR are applicable to the technology research activities of FSD.
The term FSD often is used loosely. An activity is considered to be a legitimate part of the technology research function of FSD if the following situations hold:
* The whole farm is viewed as a system.
* Research is conducted with a recognition and emphasis on the choice of priorities that reflect the whole farm.
* Research on a farm sub-system is legitimate FSD, provided the connections with other sub-systems are recognized and taken into account.
* Evaluation of research results explicitly takes into account linkages between sub-systems.
* As long as the concept of the whole farm and its environment is preserved, not all the factors determining the farming system need to be considered as variables -- some may be treated as parameters or constants.
A distinctive feature of FSR, or rather FSD, is that a systems perspective is constantly borne in mind. Within this framework, one can look at either a small or a large number of variables in the system. In general, because of the complexities of simultaneously handling a large number of variables, most FSR programmes have tended to limit the number of variables they study and to regard the other factors that influence the farming system as parameters or constants.
Figure 3 2: Progression in farming systems thinking
Three general approaches to FSR or FSD with a technology generation focus, have been defined relating to the number of variables being investigated. These approaches can be described as FSD 'with a pre-determined focus', 'in the small', and 'in the large' [Norman and Collinson, 1986], In a sense [Norman and Lightfoot, 1992], these types represent an evolution in FSD as techniques have been developed to handle progressively more complex situations -- defined as involving a higher ratio of variables to parameters, The progression, which is illustrated in Figure 3.2, where it has been expanded to four phases, can be articulated as follows:
* In its early days, FSR (i.e., FSD) type activities concentrated on how farm yields of particular crops could be raised. This form of on-farm research stood in sharp contrast to earlier multi-locational on-farm trials, in which only the effects of the physical (i.e., natural or technical) environment were tested, Even though this FSD approach did involve the inclusion of socio-economic elements and, hence, had a farming systems perspective, it was done with a 'predetermined focus' on the productivity of a particular commodity. Thus, this approach involves looking at one facet of an enterprise (Box 3.1) or one specific enterprise (Box 3.2) and identifying improvements within that focus that are compatible with the whole farming system. With the creation of distinct FSD teams -- in contrast to an on-farm testing component located within each station based commodity team -- FSD activities generally have evolved beyond this level. However, it is important to recognise that
this type of activity still is a legitimate part of any FSD in the sense that it can provide a very useful input into the activities of commodity research teams.
* In the pursuit of greater farmer participation, research shifted to addressing farmers' articulated problems directly. Still, farmers' problems were very much con fined to crop production, although links with other components of the whole farm system were studied. An alternative name for this 'farming systems in the small' focus could be 'farming systems with a whole farm problem focus' (Box 3,3), Many FSD efforts currently tend to be at this point, However, currently, on-farm research projects that seek to improve whole farm performance through manipulation of the linkages between all enterprises are few,
* Looking further ahead and to enable addressing issues of sustainable agriculture effectively, concerns for maximizing the economic and biological performance of enterprises will be modified by concerns relating to ensuring sustainability, including the rehabilitation and regeneration of natural resource systems. This natural resource system dimension to sustainable agriculture can be thought of as a type of 'farming systems in the large, or 'farming systems with a natural resource systems focus' (Box 3.4),
* Similarly, attention to ecological sustainability will need expanding to include the many off-farm and non-farm activities that make up sustainable livelihoods. This also can be thought of as a type of 'farming systems in the large, or 'farming systems with a livelihood systems focus' (Box 3,5).
These notions, particularly the last two, have been largely unexplored until recently, when techniques have evolved to handle complex situations in which the ratio of variables to parameters is high. Formal modelling techniques by themselves generally have limited value in addressing such situations because of the complexity of the relationships and the degree of understanding that is required initially to develop a realistic model. However, the major breakthrough that has occurred is the ability to pursue a less formal or more informal modelling approach through application of farmer participatory type techniques that, in essence, involve using farmers' minds as computers!
BOX 3.1: FSD WITH A 'PRE-DETERMINED FOCUS' ON SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY
Researchers in station-based programmes often want FSD workers to evaluate specific technologies they have developed to see how they fit in with constraints of the farming system currently used by farmers. This type of work is referred to as FSD with a 'pre-determined focus' or 'predetermined technology focus,' In Botswana, FSD teams and participating farmers have assisted station programmes in testing cowpea varieties, evaluating the desirability of hilling groundnuts, ascertaining whether the Dutch hoe can help with the weeding operation, and so forth.
This type of testing in FSD is not analogous to typical technical transfer. Rather than testing fully finished products, FSD assists technology generating programmes, usually based on research stations. Often, the types of technology tested in this manner have not been identified as having high leverage power in the system (see Section 6.4.1). Leverage power refers to the ability of a technology change to have a major impact on the performance of the farming system. However, these technologies do fit possible needs and asking farmers to participate in their development is worthwhile, It is desirable to test technologies as early as possible in their development, This is to facilitate making modifications and to minimize waste of research resources. It also may accelerate the dissemination of suitable technology, Such technology, even if not fully appropriate, may sometimes stimulate thinking among farmers if they are not accustomed to these types of interventions. Feedback
in these instances can contribute to new innovations in technology generation.
BOX 3.2: FSD WITH A 'PRE-DETERMINED FOCUS' ON A SUBJECT
A great deal of FSD work, particularly in its earlier years, was not focused on testing specific technology as much as a pre-determined focus on a subject matter area. FSD within the CGIAR institutions such as IRRI, CIMMYT, and ICRISAT have focused on issues related to production of their respective commodity crops. ILCA focused on issues in livestock production, ICRAF in agroforestry' etc. Some FSD teams within the national agricultural research systems (NARS) also worked under limited mandates to deal with particular enterprises; commodities; or other subject areas (e.g., soil water management). The judgements of farmers, the end-users of products developed by these organizations, were foremost in these FSD activities. However, the parent institution with its technologygeneration activities would be a primary client in these instances.
BOX 3.3: FSD WITH A 'WHOLE-FARM PROBLEM PERSPECTIVE, OR 'FSD IN THE SMALL'
An FSD interdisciplinary team conducted a diagnostic survey (see Section 8.4.3) and determined that labour for satisfactory weed control in field crops is a major constraint to farm production and farm family well-being. The survey also showed that due to population pressures, farmers were no longer able to shift field sites as in the past and that deteriorating soil fertility also was becoming a major issue. However, during the course of farmers participating in testing possible solutions to these problems, discussions between the FSD team and farmers identified the potential for intensified poultry production as an additional means of improving farm income. This resulted, in addition, in collaborative testing in the area of intensive poultry production and, as a result, exemplifies FSD with a 'whole-farm problem perspective.'
The major breakthrough that has occurred is through supplementing the rapid rural appraisal (RRA) techniques, which have been available for some time. with the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques (i.e., see Chapter X), which have developed rapidly in recent years.
To date, the first two approaches listed above have been used. Although FSD 'in the small' arrives at a focus within the system in the course of diagnosis, FSD 'with . pre determined focus' moves into the system to research an enterprise or one facet of an enterprise looking for improvements within that focus that are compatible with the whole farming system.
BOX 3.4: FSD WITH A 'NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOCUS.
A non-governmental organization (NGO) has adopted, as one of its aims, the conservation of the natural resource base within areas of agricultural production. This NGO sponsors FSD activities in a village in which participating farmers look at current and prospective problems in natural resource conservation and management. They evaluate potential solutions to these problems at the same time issues in agricultural production and family income are considered.
The FSD team from the NGO and farmer participants discovered a number of incongruencies between issues of conservation and present day agricultural production. They included the following:
* Natural-resource conservation analyses focus on the landscape (e.g., possibly a watershed), which in some instances does not even correspond to a village or to any other political entity. On the other hand, agricultural production analyses tend to focus on individual farms, units within farms, or smaller interacting networks of farms.
* Conservation invariably takes a long-term perspective of problems and solutions, whereas production analyses consider short-term returns and immediate survival issues.
* Natural resource conservation often involves community or ultra-community efforts and goals, which might conflict in terms of labour or other requirements, with individual farm production activities.
Integrating these apparently opposing sets of objectives for natural resource conservation and production poses a major challenge for FSD. Participating farmers recognize many of the conservation issues and trends and some express concern for the future. In some cases, traditional techniques for conservation such as gully amelioration have been identified and are being promoted, but other issues remain unresolved. Some of the constraints encountered today or anticipated in the future were unknown to farmers in the past. Solutions therefore, are not known, and innovative and problem-solving thinking is required. However, given farmers' intimate knowledge of their current and past production environment, their input in designing appropriate strategies for the future based on an analysis of what has happened in the past is indispensable. This is clearly a fertile area for active collaboration between on-farm and on-station work: a give and take between farmers, scientists, and
policy makers.
3.4 Some characteristics of FSD
Some of the major characteristics of FSD are as follows:
* Farmer Centre Stage. The farmer, as the consumer of the improved technologies, is in the centre of the stage. This provides an opportunity for researchers to learn from the farmer, enables him or her to have an input into the research process, and ensures that criteria relevant to him or her are used in evaluating proposed technologies. For the farming family, evaluation criteria (i.e., for the adoption of the improved technologies) can be divided into the following groups:
* Necessary conditions determine whether the farming family would be able to adopt the improved practices. Such conditions include technical feasibility, social acceptability, and compatibility with external institutions -- that is, support systems.
* Sufficient conditions determine whether the farmer would be willing to adopt the improved practices. Obviously, the necessary conditions will be influential in determining this willingness. Sufficient conditions include the compatibility of the improved practices with the goal(s) (e.g., food self-sufficiency, profit maximization, risk minimization, etc.) of the farming family; the resources they have access to; and the farming system they now practice.
* Work with Representative Farmers. Although the input of farmers is critically important in FSD it is impossible for FSD teams to work with all farmers. Therefore, a few are selected that are thought to be representative of all farmers. Because there are many types of farmers -- with differences in the products they produce, the resources they possess, and the problems they face -- it is necessary to put farmers with similar characteristics in the same group (i.e., stratum or recommendation domain) (see Section 4.5). A small sample of farmers in each of these groups then is selected to work with the FSD team. If the grouping and selection of farmers are carried out correctly, then the results obtained by these representative farmers should be achievable by other farmers with similar characteristics, when the technologies are extended to other farmers by extension staff.
* Involves an lnterdisciplinary Approach. As indicated earlier (Section 2.2), farmers have complex farming systems. As a result, changes in one part of the farming system may have a good or bad impact on another part of the farming system. For example, in some areas, it is not realistic, or indeed desirable, to try and increase crop productivity without considering livestock at all,' Also, attaining a successful solution to a technical problem that has been identified will depend on whether the farming family has the labour and money to adopt (i.e., an economic issue) and any sociological reasons preventing them from adopting. Therefore, to address the wide range of farming systems' issues, FSD teams generally consist of representatives of a number of disciplines -- usually agronomists, animal scientists, and agricultural economists and sometimes sociologists. As a result, an interdisciplinary approach, that is a number of disciplines working together on the same problem,
has to be used to solve the problems of farmers (see Section 6.2).
* Dynamic and Iterative Approach. Because of the dynamic nature of agriculture, research is a never-ending process. Farmers always face problems to varying degrees in their farming operation, and many of these problems can be solved through research. Sometimes the solutions suggested as a result of research don't work and need to be modified. This is implied in Figure 3.1, where the dotted lines indicate that such failures require moving back to an earlier stage in the FSD process and repeating one or more of the steps in the process. This makes FSD an iterative as well as a dynamic approach.
* Complementary to Station-based Research. In the context of technology choice and development, the role of FSD (i.e., utilising a systems approach) is seen to be complementary to technical component research (i.e., which primarily employs a reductionist approach), most of which is undertaken on experiment stations and is usually commodity-based, With respect to such research, FSD has three roles:
* To look at recognized farming systems and the stock of materials and techniques accumulated from station-based research, so as to be able to choose technical solutions to problems that have been identified, On-farm experimentation then adapts chosen solutions to the local situation. This is a mobilizing and adaptive role, shaping the product for an identified market.
* To pass back unsolved technical problems, important to the system, to the appropriate commodity research team on the experiment station, This role is one of identifying and helping to prioritize the agenda for technical research.
* To link with farmer clients and extension staff in local farm situations, drawing both farmers and extension workers and other relevant 'actors' into the technology-generation process.
Two examples indicating the perils of not exploiting the complementarily between onfarm and station-based research are given in Boxes 3.6 and 3,7. Similar linkages could be established with planning and development agencies concerning proposed policy/support programme changes. Unfortunately, these are not yet strongly developed in most countries.
BOX 3.5: FSD WITH A 'LIVELIHOOD-SYSTEMS FOCUS'
There are, to date, relatively few good examples of applying FSD with a 'livelihood systems focus.' One organization that in recent years has expended considerable effort in integrating 'off farm' with 'on-farm' activities in a sustainable manner has been ICLARM which has concentrated on integrating aquaculture with crops and livestock [Lightfoot and Noble, 1992].
Certainly integration of 'on-farm' and 'non-farm' activities deserve much greater emphasis than it has to date, especially as increasing pressures develop on the natural resource base. 'Non-farm' activities car provide an outlet for surplus labour and contribute to the attainment of sustainable livelihoods. In many areas (e.g., semi-arid parts of West Africa), particularly where agricultural activities are seasonal in nature, farmers have always recognized the complementarily between farm and non-farm activities, through emphasizing the latter particularly during slack periods in the agricultural cycle [Norman et al, 1981], Many of these jobs are in the non-formal sector and involve micro-enterprises [Liedholm and Chuta, 1976; Liedholm and Mead, 1993], also an area that needs much greater emphasis than it has to date.
BOX 3.6: TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE RELEVANT ON-FARM
In Botswana, precipitation is low and variable, creating erratic conditions for crop production. Under these conditions, farmers minimize risk by adopting an extensive low-input cropping system that is moderately productive under favourable conditions but minimizes losses when rainfall fails. Under research-station management, an intensive system for maize increased average yields and dramatically improved yield stability. The intensive system consisted of controlled pathways for planting with minimal tillage of the soil and water concentration onto the plant zone. It is the water concentration that stabilizes maize yields. Weed control was as used needed but weed pressures were minimal when crops were established early.
This technology failed when it was tested under farmer management. It failed because critical resources are not available on the farm at the right time to meet the schedule requirements of the new technology. The intensive system requires that soil preparation be finished before the rainy season begins and that planting be carried out on the first rain(s) of the year. Meanwhile, draught animals to do this work are kept near watering points at distant cattle posts until rains have filled shallow wells and ponds near the herds. Farmers and their draught animals cannot plant early in the season, and when they do not, weed growth overruns the controlled pathways. The Ministry of Agriculture made a fitting decision to conduct farmer-managed tests before recommending this system to farmers based on station results alone.
3.5 A systems or reductionist approach?
Is this the only choice? It might be popular to think in terms of the one or the other; systems, approaches or reductionism, each with its characteristics and methodology. Should one 'divide and conquer' or accept that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"? A distinction is made between science and art but also it is reflected in divergent schools of thinking within some disciplines. However, in FSD, this rigid dichotomy of perspective is neither necessary or feasible.
FSD recognizes that farming systems are highly complex and not fully reducible. They are too complex for human intuition to deal with all the factors involved but, at the same time, consist of such a fuzzy web of interactions that currently available analytical tools are not powerful enough to describe them.
Over the years, science in agriculture has attempted to model the factors and relationships within a farm operating in an agro-ecological situation. The purpose of this modelling invariably has been to engineer optimal solutions or strategies. An important limitation to this approach is that optimization has been for the research model and not for the farm and the farming family itself. A larger purposeful framework comprising a farm value system and related decision making patterns cannot be incorporated so readily into this research model.
FSD seeks to synthesize human intuition and judgement with analytical science. To accomplish this, FSD uses farmer perspectives on issues, problems, etc. Even when these are not completely exact, they help create holistic or logical frameworks within which technical aIternatives can be screened or engineered. FSD also seeks to render the holistic framework as explicit as possible. Farmers and FSD staff seek to differentiate uncertainty in the system that is due to randomness (i.e., rainfall probabilities) from that due to lack of experience (i.e., ignorance about new technology) from that due to vagueness (i.e., typically, decision making patterns). By integrating relevant scientific information, hands-on experiences, and intuitive managerial skills, FSD can be effective in evaluating scenarios, even those involving future changes in the farming environment.
Within this framework, numerous scientific information needs will be recognized. Within this framework, the need is to obtain rather unequivocal answers to the specific and well defined questions. Reductionist's techniques are better suited for this purpose, especially if the question pertains to objects in the system rather than human behaviour, which involves human intuition skills. The key to successfully designing this type of focused research is the incorporation of different perspectives through interdisciplinary teamwork and participation of farmer managers.
Thus, 'rigour versus relevancy' need not be a dilemma in FSD, On the contrary, rigour and relevancy are both possible and essential, if solutions are to be found in time for the many pressing problems that confront farming systems in a rapidly changing world.
The systems analysis employed in FSD should do the following:
* Pay particular attention to formulating problems within the holistic framework.
* Review each result within the general systems framework and never exclude an aIternative without having done this. Sometimes, the best alternative in a systems framework is tar from optimal when evaluated separately.
* Set forth hypotheses early, so that all 'actors' with their perspectives can participate in reformulating these questions. After all, it is these questions more than 'responses, that set systems approaches apart.
* Avoid overemphasizing mathematical representation at the earliest stages.
* Treat even uncertainty as explicitly as possible.
* Sub-optimize with care. With reference to this, see the second point in this list.
Thus, there is a complementarity between the reductionist and systems approaches. This is why it was argued earlier that the FSD approach is complementary to station-based research, which usually employs a reductionist approach. The holistic approach in FSD is needed to ensure that experiment stations develop relevant technologies and needs to exploit the power of the reductionist approach, which can be a very efficient way of developing new technologies, once the priorities have been ascertained correctly. The results of this potentially relevant technological work can then be given to the FSD team for on-farm evaluation.
BOX 3.7:'APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY' WILL NOT ALWAYS BE RELEVANT ON-FARM
Appropriate technology is characterized as low cost, technologically simple, labour intensive, making use of local materials and existing methods of production, and responding to identified constraints in the farming system. FSD generally seeks technologically appropriate solutions to problems but these should not be promoted automatically without on-farm assessments.
The Bolivian altiplano is a hostile environment for agricultural production. The zone is dry and cold with nightly frosts occurring at any time of year. In earlier periods, farmers of this area traded products of their system for various food products of the lowlands. In recent times, their access to other markets has partially been broken off. Land degradation and pressures on use of the land have further reduced the ability of farmers to maintain their traditional crop and livestock production strategies.
Protected horticultural systems were identified by several NGOs as appropriate ways to solve problems in this system [Kohl, 1991]. For the most part, these systems were promoted directly without an objective assessment including testing under farmers' conditions. Initial glasshouses were soon found to have difficulties with high insolation costs and were replaced by adobe structures covered with plastic. But many other problems were not addressed or proved unsolvable: guaranteed water supplies, local and distant markets for excess production, nutritional benefits of products, and so forth.
An important finding of a study of this large and costly effort is that promoters of development have not taken experimentation seriously enough. The value of farmer and expert involvement in design, testing, and dissemination is that irrelevant or incorrect designs and management systems can be screened out or corrected.
3.6 FSD in the context of other agricultural institutions
Work relating to FSD might be incorporated as a working tool for several different types of institutions. These could include such diverse institutions as agricultural research, extension, community development (particularly in regards to NGOs), or even ministerial or national units interested in policy design and assessment.
FSD thus can he used to focus on family income. technology design, dissemination, and adoption: or designing solutions to the problems associated with a deteriorating natural resource base in agricultural areas. At another level of viewing the institutional setting of FSD, it is apparent that not only some disciplines but also various technical and sociological approaches and methods, are evolving to better deal with systems analysis. Take, for examples, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool integrating large amounts of data into a single framework useful for technical as well as sociological and economic analyses. On the other hand, community development and policy reform programmes use increasingly sophisticated techniques (i.e., tools or methods) that contribute to decentralized planning, grass-roots participation, and empowerment in assessing problems and designing solutions.
The emphasis in many areas is on developing integrated approaches and system type analytical methods. With the possibility of increasing convergence occurring in some of the methods and, in some cases, objectives, the unique contributions by FSD will be brought into question by some. And, in fact, the institutional role or mandate of FSD will vary. FSD in one setting may focus Iargely on trials and farmer testing of new technology. In another setting, a greater emphasis may be placed on surveys, sociological or information related to the financial picture of the whole farm, and so forth, In the larger picture, none of this matters too much. But it should be remembered that FSD does have certain fundamental characteristics (See Sections 3.2 and 3,4). These include:
* Iteration, such that no single proposal should be considered definitive.
* Integration, usually involving multiple disciplines and explicit building on managerial perspectives and managerial values.
* A consistent orientation towards problem solving and an attitude that no perspective on this problem should be discounted.
FSD also must focus on appropriate linkages with other development support programs and institutions (for example, see Section 2.4). In this regard, FSD emphasizes a strongly integrative and integrating philosophy, not just for disciplinary and farming perspectives within FSD itself; hut integrating strengths of personnel, resources, information, and location of the FSD programme with other research and development programmes working in the same area or domain. A critical element of this inter-institutional integration is a logical division of labour for the problem-solving task, This invariably will encourage collaboration in the development of work plans both for short-term as well as medium- and long-term objectives.

3.7 Challenges facing FSD
A number of challenges face FSD if it is to continue playing a significant role in facilitating the process of agricultural development. Some of these are:
* Better Incorporation of Farmers, Incorporating farmers into the research process was one of the most important principles underlying the evolution of the farming systems approach. The basic justification for this was that farmers could improve the efficiency of the research process. At a minimum, it was argued they could prevent the use of research resources on types of technologies that they would be unlikely to adopt, while even more Importantly, it was anticipated they could, in their own right, contribute positively to the research process. Unfortunately, farming systems workers often have not sufficiently recognized this positive and interactive contribution of farmers. Consequently, this spawned the farmer participatory research (FPR) movement [Farrington and Martin, 1988]. The problem of not utilizing the farmer sufficiently in FSD activities is not due to inherent deficiencies in FSD itself but rather with the way in which it has been applied, Techniques of FPR
or PRA need to be incorporated into FSD, a subject which will be discussed later (see Section 8.4).
* Continued Evolution of FSD. FSD is relatively new. Therefore, the methodology is still evolving and, as a result, universally accepted 'standard texts' on the 'nuts and bolts, of how to do it are still to emerge. Related to the methodology issue is that time and cost-efficient (i.e., money and people) methods for undertaking FSD still need further development. This is important because of the limited resources available for undertaking research, both on-station and on-farm. In this manual an effort has been made to address this issue in a number of places -- particularly in Chapters 7 and 8.
* Greater Incorporation of the Policy/Support System Perspective. As has been stressed already' the farming systems approaches implemented to date have focused mainly on the technology dimension (i.e., FSR). However, a basic principle of the FSD approach is that the farming systems perspective is critically important in formulating and adapting policy/support systems in ways that will facilitate and accelerate the agricultural development process, Once again, discussions relating to the policy/support system are scattered throughout the manual, and it is highlighted as an essential component of FSD in Figure 3.1. Failure to incorporate this dimension in FSD activities is likely to have an impact analogous to playing soccer on one leg, Nevertheless, because of the lack of much proven experience and documented material on the farming system perspective with respect to the policy/support system, this manual does not deal with this dimension to the extent that would be
desirable. Hopefully, this lack of experience will be rectified in the fairly near future. An example of the potential value of using a policy/support perspective in FSD is given in Box 3.8.
* Incorporating Equity Issues -- Intra and lnter-Generational. FSD tries to help the farmer with the problems he or she has identified. Of course, the reason for this is the necessity to introduce an intervention in which they are interested, It its likely that these 'felt, problems of farmers are likely to have a short-run focus (i.e., particularly when the farmer is operating very close to the survival level). Also, it is possible that helping to solve the individual farmers' problems creates others for the society as a whole. Although the example given in Box 3.9 pertains to inter-household relationships, equity considerations within a particular generation also apply to what is happening within farming families. As will be discussed later (see Section 4.4), it is wrong to assume that all farming households or families operate in such a way that distribution of effort and benefits is equitable. For a positive example of the benefits of understanding intra household
relationships, see Box 3.1(). When designing a technology to help farmers increase their productivity, consideration must be given to the possible long-term effects (e.g., decreasing the amount of productive land available) of that intervention. Therefore, if farming system (FS) workers are not careful, their work can result in creating two types of inequalities, that is, helping some farming households -- or even certain individuals within those households -- at the expense of others and/or reducing the quantity and quality of land that can be productively farmed by future generations. Avoiding the development of such inequities constitutes a major challenge to FSD teams who need techniques to be able to screen out proposed technologies and policy/support systems that would encourage or exacerbate such trends. Once again, issues relating to equity matters, although generally recognized as important, still need attention in farming systems type activities. This will
require continued evolution of FSD towards the FS 'in the large' approach mentioned earlier (Section 3.3).
* Assessing Agricultural Research Impact. Related to the research resource issue is the importance of devoting some effort to assessing the impact of the research process - something that often has been done inadequately. More attention needs to be paid to adoption/diffusion studies. Such studies, of course, are the best measure of the impact of the agricultural development process, Therefore, the credit for favourable results from such studies cannot be allocated to FSD activities alone. However, FSD teams, because of their on-farm location and pivotal linkages with other actors, are often in the best position to take a leadership role in their execution. Also, as suggested earlier (Section 3.2), such studies can and should be used for other purposes, such as feeding back priorities for further research and providing evidence for adjustments in the policy/support system to encourage greater adoption,
* Improving Credibility of FSD. Establishing credibility for FSD-related activities is a major challenge and is necessary to ensure that some of the limited research resources always will be allocated to them, As argued earlier (Section 2.4), FSD staff constitute only one set of the 'actors' in the agricultural development process. Additionally, FSD helps facilitate a process and does not result in a product by itself. Thus, FSD cannot claim sole credit for any technologies developed for, or adopted by, farmers. However, it achieves credibility through its linkages and cooperative efforts with other 'actors' in the agricultural development process. These 'intermediate products' need to be documented and publicized to a greater extent than often has been the case.
BOX 3.8: FSD CAN HELP IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES
On-farm systems studies were carried out in village areas south of Bangalore, India [Rushton, 1994] to determine the appropriateness of the current livestock policy.
Farmers without irrigated crop land are the poorest in this area and at greatest risk from the effects of climatic and biological variations. These farmers depend on small livestock herds for cash income and on subsistence cropping for home consumption. When their small-scale livestock production fails, farmers are forced to seek outside employment for cash, and thus cropping activities suffer.
This farming system study identified two improvements that would contribute to better livestock productivity: control of epizootics and a 'preventative veterinary medicine service' focused on improved fertility management among small herd-owners. Previously, veterinary service policy had been to target larger herds where the immediate payoff had appeared to be much greater.
Such a livestock policy change should lead to greater stability in the production of animal products for local markets; less reliance on seasonal employment and, therefore, greater stability of the household labour force; and more stable subsistence cropping activities.
BOX 3.9: INTER-HOUSEHOLD RELATIONS AND TRADE-OFFS: AN INTRAGENERATIONAL ISSUE
In Botswana, farmers have a tradition of sharing draught power, In this semi-arid environment, field operations such as ploughing and row planting depend on access to draught in a timely fashion (i.e., days on which there is adequate soil moisture for ploughing/planting).
If a technology system is introduced that requires more draught, rather than less, it may mean that the household controlling the draught may not be able to routinely allow other households to also use their animals under a sharing arrangement. Thus, helping one household may harm other households in the community.
BOX 3.10: INTRA-HOUSEHOLD DECISION MAKING AND TRADE-OFFS: ANOTHER INTRA-GENERATIONAL ISSUE
An FSD programme in Amphoe Pharao, Thailand [Shinawatra et al, 1992] discovered a positive and unexpected benefit from interaction at the intra-household level. The introduction of improved and more commercially oriented poultry operations was targeted towards women members of households, because they traditionally manage and derive income from poultry. However, improved technological interventions not only required new inputs by men but were discovered to provide profitable use of under-employed male labour in many households.
This example demonstrates decision making with interactions between members of the household that are desirable for all: a win-win situation. Often, however, decisions for change favour one segment of the household, while adversely impacting on another.
4. Some key concepts important in the farming systems approach to development
4.1 Objectives of the chapter
The objectives of this chapter are to:
* Briefly define a farming system.
* Describe the status, goals, and appropriate technology for limited-resource households.
* Briefly discuss issues relating to equitability,
* Describe the recommendation domain concept.
* Briefly describe the significance of a participatory approach to FSD.
4.2 Definition of a farming system
To design appropriate or relevant ways of helping farmers, it is essential to understand the conditions under which farmers are operating. They have in fact, very complicated farming systems. Figure 4.1 shows some of the factors that have an influence on what the farming system will be. The operator of the farming system is the farmer or the farming family. To farmers, the way in which they earn their living and the economic, social, and cultural well-being of their households are linked closely and cannot be separated.
The members of the farming household have three basic types of inputs: land, labour, and capital. Management involves allocating these to three different activities or processes, that is, crops, livestock, and off-farm enterprises. In making decisions on how to allocate their inputs in producing one or more products, farmers have to make some difficult decisions. These decisions will involve using their knowledge to come as close as possible to fulfilling the goal(s) for which they are striving. These goal(s) may vary from farmer to farmer (e.g., maximizing their income, producing enough food to feed the family, etc.). Many farmers are likely to want to maximize their incomes, once they have made sure they are producing enough food to feed their family and have met other societal obligations. The resulting combination of products (i.e., crops, livestock, and off-farm enterprises) they are producing with their inputs results from the farming system they have adopted.
Nevertheless, the extent to which the farming system fulfils the goal(s) they have chosen will depend on the managerial skills of the farming family and its ability to make good decisions in the allocation of inputs in a very uncertain production environment.
Figure 4.1: Schematic representation of some farming system determinants
However, some parts of the environment that influence what the farming system will be are outside the control of the individual farming family thus causing uncertainty as far as the farmer is concerned. The 'total' environment in which farming households operate consists of two parts: the technical (i.e., natural or physical) element and the human element [Nonnan et al, 1982].
* The technical element determines the types of, and physical potential of; livestock and crop enterprises. For example, in some areas, the low level of rainfall allows sorghum, but not maize, to be grown on rainfed land. The technical element includes physical and biological factors. These often are modified to some extent through technology developments -- for example, increasing water availability through irrigation Improving soil quality by adding fertilizer, breeding for yield stability during drought, etc.
* The farming system that actually evolves, however, is only part of what is potentially possible. The human element is important in determining what the actual farming system will be. The human element consist of two types of factors: exogenous and endogenous.
Exogenous factors (i.e., the social environment) are largely out of the control of the individual farming family. These factors will influence what the farming family can do and can be divided into three broad groups:
* Community structures, norms, and beliefs.
* External institutions, which include extension, credit, and input distribution systems on the input side and markets on the output side.
* Other influences, such as population density, location, and infrastructure.
Endogenous factors, on the other hand, are those the individual farming household controls to some degree. These include the types of inputs mentioned earlier, that is, land, Iabour, and capita]. It is important to recognize that these resources and managerial ability vary among households and regions. The resources vary on the basis of quantity and quality, both of which influence the performance and the potential of the system. In addition, these inputs or resources may or may not be owned by the household. Access to one or more of these resources may be on another basis of use (e.g., borrowing draught animals), which may limit or restrict the ease or intensity of use and thus, in turn, affect the goals and performance of the farm family.
Nevertheless, it is the fanning family that decides on the farming system that will emerge. However, this system will be influenced and sometimes constrained by the technical element and exogenous factors.
The farming system is obviously complex, and the results can vary greatly because of differences in the 'total, environment. These facts help explain why some technology thought to be relevant often has not been adopted, or when it has, why the degree of adoption has varied widely. Not considering the human element in agricultural research has contributed to many socalled 'improved' technologies being irrelevant.
4.3 The limited-resource household: status, goals, and appropriate technology
Typical limited resource farm households in low income countries generally are characterized as follows [Ellis, 1988: p. 12]:
"Farm households, with access to their means of livelihood in land, utilizing mainly labour in farm production, always located in a larger economic system, but fundamentally characterized by partial engagement in markets which tend to function with a high degree of imperfection."
Important points to note about this definition are that:
* Such households often are subordinate to some other external forces. That is, they do not have complete control over their own destiny and are in a process of transition. This is because of not being integrated fully in the market economy.
* They have access to land to pursue their livelihood. They cultivate the land largely with family labour, in conjunction with only small amounts of capital.
* The input or factor markets (i.e., land, labour, and capital) work poorly. Concerning land, non-market rights of access or non-price forms of tenure are more likely to operate than a freehold market. The capital markets usually are developed poorly and variable production inputs are often not available. As a result [Ellis, 1988: p. 12]:
"Credit and interest rates may be tied to other factor prices like land and labour within a dependent economic relationship. Thus factor markets may be locked together contractually rather than being independent."
Also, market information may be highly imperfect (i.e., not available or readily accessible). Thus, it is not surprising that sharing and reciprocity often exist between households. In these non-market transactions, exchange of unlike goods and services take place, which are not valued by market prices. Sometimes, such relationships exist between households that are related to each other.
* Another reason why such households are integrated only partially into the market economy is because they consume a proportion of the product they produce. This enables them to have some ability to survive independently of the larger system, which may be important in explaining their economic behaviour.
A number of microeconomic theories have been developed in an effort to explain the economic behaviour of farm households. These are based on various assumptions about household goals and the characteristics of the markets within which households make their decisions. Ellis [1988] notes that these theories are not mutually exclusive, sharing as they do certain key assumptions such as:
* The household is a single decision-making unit for economic analysis purposes. As a result, it maximizes a single utility (satisfaction) function that represents the joint welfare of its members.
* Profit maximization and utility maximization coincide where income is the only variable in the utility function. Profit maximization is always one of the components of utility maximization" when all the input and output markets are fully formed and competitive.
Ellis [1988] suggests that the theories predict different results because of different assumptions about the working of the factor and product markets, rather than because of differences in assumptions about household goal(s). In fact, an important characteristic distinguishing many of the theories results from different assumptions about labour markets and the allocation of household labour time, In support of these assertions, Ellis [1988] then discusses a number of these theories of economic behaviour. He calls these profit maximization, risk aversion, drudgery aversion, farm household theories, and share tenancy. In doing so, he recognizes the impossibility of separating short-run household decisions from the wider social relations of production.
Consequently, there is likely to be a certain universality in the aspirations of limited-resource farming households. The most important elements are income, effort avoidance, and risk avoidance. In economic terms, this means such households try to increase their utility or satisfaction, which increases with income but decreases with greater effort or higher levels of risk. This can be restated as maximizing income for any given level of effort or risk. Alternatively, it can mean reducing risk, or effort, for a given level of income [Norman, 1982].
Attempts to maximize utility or satisfaction take place within a set of constraints. As implied above, differences in the constraints, rather than the aspirations, lead to the most important differences in farming systems. As discussed earlier (Section 4.2), Figure 4,1 indicates some of the determinants of the farming system. It is easy to visualize constraints relating to the technical element causing differences in the type and productivity of farming systems, However, also important in the differentiation process are the factors relating to the human element. The quantity, quality, and ratios (i.e., particularly between land and labour) of the endogenous factors (i.e., factors of production -- land, labour, and capital) play an important role in further differentiating farming systems. The extent to which they can be modified will depend on the degree of integration into the factor markets (i.e.? input markets). Also the products resulting will be influenced to some
extent by community norms and beliefs and the degree of integration into the product market.
The above discussion has important implications for what is appropriate technological change. For example, limited resource households often are likely to be very little above survival level and, hence, will place a very high premium on improved stability of production. The levels, qualities, and relative proportions of the factors of production are important in indicating the most appropriate route for improving the productivity and profit of the farming system -- which is maximizing the return to the most limiting factor. For example, in areas of high land/labour ratios (i.e., low population densities), labour saving (e.g., mechanical, extensive livestock production) types of technology/systems are likely to be most appropriate. In contrast, in areas of low land/resident ratios (i.e., high population density) land saving technologies/systems (e.g., biological and some chemical, intensive livestock production) will likely be more appropriate. However, as Table 4.1 shows,
increasing the return to the most limiting factor can have an indirect positive or negative impact on the use and productivity of other inputs. Thus, in view of the imperfect operation of the factor markets, care has to be taken in evaluating what would be the most relevant technologies.
For example, in a semi-arid area, initial superficial examination may indicate that because of the high population densities, strategies designed to increase the productivity of land would be most important. However, given the seasonal nature of agriculture in semi-arid areas, there will be periods of intense labour activity during the year. These will create labour bottleneck periods, followed by periods of underemployment. Thus, land-augmenting strategies using labour at critical labour bottleneck periods -- when the opportunity cost of labour is high (i.e., there are good alternative uses for labour that can yield an equally high return) -- could be unattractive to the household (see Box 4.1 ). This is likely if adoption of such strategies involves the use of more labour at such labour bottleneck periods. It will also be likely if the productivity per unit of labour applied at that time is higher in alternative uses.

BOX 4.1: TECHNOLOGIES ARE RARELY SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF RETURN PER UNIT AREA AND LABOUR
In the early 1970's, three technological packages were tested with farmers in Northern Nigeria [Norman et al, 1982]. Farmers involved in testing them used animal traction and, operating in a semi-arid production environment, were faced with a major weeding bottleneck in June-July. The three technological packages were compared with each other and, in the case of sorghum and cotton, with indigenous practices, Summarized results were as follows:

a. Indigenous practice , for maize could not be compared because maize was rarely grown in that area at that time.
b. Average of the results in 1973 and 1974 seasons.
The results indicated the superiority of the improved maize technology over both improved or indigenous practices for sorghum and cotton in terms of both return per unit of land and labour. Note that for both the sorghum and cotton improved technologies, the return per unit area was higher than that from employing indigenous practices; but that the return per unit of labour used during the June/July period was the same or lower. Unlike the sorghum and cotton improved technologies, the improved maize technology was, from a profit viewpoint, suitable for farmers whether they were faced with a labour or land limitation.
Not surprisingly, since the 1970s, improved maize technologies have been adopted widely in Northern Nigeria, in a mini-Green Revolution [Smith et al, 1994]. Although, initially the prime motivation for growing maize was as a cash crop, it eventually became a more important dietary item as farming households made trade-off decisions between growing the high yielding maize rather than the low yielding sorghum.

4.4 Equitability considerations - intra- and inter- generational
4.4.1 Intra-Household or Gender Issues
Many development projects have assumed that the male head-of-household provides the majority of agricultural labour and is the sole decision maker concerning agricultural activities. This approach fails to recognize the important contribution to women and children to agricultural production in many parts of the world. Although data are very unreliable, the indications are that female family labour ranges from 2 to over 50 percent of farm labour [Boserup, 1970]. Women's participation in production agriculture may range from zero in some Moslem countries to the situation in Africa south of the Sahara, which is a region of 'female farming systems' where women may manage and work more than one-third of the farms. Despite the great contribution made by women, development projects have been slow to recognize this contribution. As Jacobson [1993: pp. 61-62] points out:
"The reason is brutally simple: women perform the lion's share of work in subsistence economies, toiling longer hours and contributing more to family income than men do. Yet in a world where economic value is computed in monetary terms alone, women's work is not counted as economically productive when no money changes hands."
She goes on to suggest that this gender bias is compounded in many societies by discrimination based on class, cast, or race.
This situation can lead to complications because of differentiation in the types of labour available from household sources, Microeconomic theories that make simplistic assumptions about farming households add to the problem, For example, they assume a single decision-making unit and a single utility function representing the joint welfare of family members. However, increasingly this has been recognized as a problem, because intra-household relationships can have a major impact on economic behaviour, Some important points to note about intrahousehold relationships are as follows [Ellis, 1988; Feldstein et al, 1988]:
* Such relationships are of particular importance in situations where there is a high degree of congruence between the production and consumption units. They are also important where there is some imperfection in terms of integration with the factor and product markets.
* The economic situation of individuals within households is influenced by the social norms or behaviour of the society within which they reside, Therefore, specific economic roles are socially assigned to men, women, and children, Also, division of property, labour and income within households is socially, and not biologically, determined. As a result, males and females within households sometimes may have different income streams, with different sources and different destinations.
* Thus, it is wrong to assume that male and female labour can substitute for each other across the range of household activities. As a result, rigidities in time allocation may reduce the ability of households to respond to market signals. Therefore? such division of labour can impose constraints on seasonal labour inputs and ability to respond to price changes. As a result, it can have a major impact on the composition and level of farm output.
* Because of the above, increases in household income are unlikely to benefit all members equally. This often is exacerbated by the social subordination of women in many societies. As pointed out above, agricultural policies and projects often have ignored the role of women in agricultural production -- not only as operators but also as decision makers. As a result, it is not surprising that technological innovations have tended to disadvantage women relative to men.
Therefore, an understanding of operational constraints facing limited resource households, and the relationships that exist between members of the households and between households is critically important in determining what are likely to be appropriate criteria for evaluating potential technologies. In connection with this, it is also important to understand the farming household members' goals and incentives, farming and non-farming activities, and resources available.
4.4.2 Inter-Generational or Sustainability Issues
As was pointed out previously (Section 3,7), incorporating equity issues relating to the intergenerational impact of development is one of the challenges facing FSD. There is a great deal of concern about the impact of an ever increasing world population on the world's natural resources. This concern was evident at the Earth Summit held in June 1993 in Rio de Janeiro. Part of this concern was related to the loss of nearly 500 billion tons of topsoil through erosion in the 20 years between the previous meeting in Stockholm and the Rio de Janeiro meeting. According to Brown [1993], this and other environmental factors have contributed to a decrease in the rate with which food output is growing -- an alarming situation given the increasing population to be fed.
Most farmers, and hence development programs, are concerned with local short-run production problems rather than the broad picture presented at the Earth Summit. This its logical, given the farmer's need to survive at the present, but it does not excuse the FSD team from considering the long-term, intergenerational and sustainability, impacts of their programmes, Although not the only factor to consider in the inter-generational and sustainability area, a major concern is soil conservation,'' Norman and Douglas [1994] identify a number of concerns when addressing soil conservation issues.
* Good land husbandry requires a mix of improved farming practices integrated with farm policies and programmes. Thus, it is essential to understand the current farming system in order to design effective conservation measures. This implies that a systems perspective be used.
* The goal should be to prevent rather than cure soil erosion. This means that the causes of soil erosion must be understood and treated, rather than concentrating on treating the symptoms.
* To be most effective, conservation programs should be planned with the full knowledge and participation of the farmers. FSD team members must be able to communicate effectively with farmers to identify their ideas, perceptions, and priorities, so these can be taken into account in developing strategies for improvement.
* If farmers are going to implement changes, they must be convinced that they can obtain short-term benefits from change (i.e., have an incentive to aIter present practices). Thus, it is important to try and identify strategies that will have short-term benefits as well as provide long-run conservation improvements. When dual-purpose strategies cannot be designed, the long-term conservation activities should be linked with measures that provide short-term production/welfare benefits.
* For any conservation activities that require community action (e.g., soil conservation on a watershed), it is important that the communities have responsibility and control and aIso reap the benefits of such action, in an equitable manner.
* Long term programmes are more effective than short-term programmes. Thus, it follows that the change will take place over a long period, necessitating adjustments and iterations in programmes.
BOX 4.2: BALANCING INDIVIDUAL FARM AND COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES
Rapid changes are occurring in cropping system recommendations and practices in the Andes of Bolivia [Genin et al, 19941. Some of these changes are in conflict with objectives and beliefs held by the community.
Individual villagers in this region occupy field sites for two or three years within communal lands and then shift to new sites. Individuals make their own decisions about cropping practices, and the community collectively decides when shifts are in order. The fallow period typically lasts from 3-15 years and provides communal grazing, rejuvenates soil fertility, aids with pest control in crop production, and provides fuel for the household. Furthermore, the long-term fallow system, aynuga, contributes symbolically to the well-being of the community and its sense of stewardship.
Adoption of 'improved, cropping practices by individual farmers on their fields could change the way in which they wish to occupy space in the long-term fallow system. Solutions to this restraint will require balancing objectives of individual farmers and community.
These considerations are in addition to technical considerations in soil conservation and imply that the FSD team must possess skills other than just technical skills. This is implied in the example given in Box 4.2.
Although this discussion has centred on soil conservation, the approach and factors to consider can he applied equally well to other programme areas where there are inter-generational or sustainability considerations -which will include most programme areas.
4.5 Recommendation domains
A recommendation is information that farmers can use to improve the productivity of their resources (i.e., farming system) [CIMMYT, 1988A]. A good or successful recommendation, therefore, would consist of the practices that farmers would follow, given their current resources. if they had all the information actually available to the researchers. Obviously, the development of recommendations for farmers should be as efficient as possible. Because it is impossible to make a separate recommendation for each farmer practical compromises have to be made. As indicated earlier (Section 3.4), this is done by stratifying the farmers into groups as homogeneous as possible. Farmers in these groups should have similar circumstances. resources, problems, and solutions to those problems. In this situation, therefore, it is usually assumed that the same recommendation will be suitable for all the farmers in the group. Such a group of farmers is a particular recommendation domain [Byerlee
et al, 1980]. Recommendation domains may be defined by agro-ecological (technical) and/or by socio-economic (human) circumstances (Box 4.3). The definition of the recommendation domain depends on the particular recommendation [CIMMYT, 1988A] (see Box 4.4).
Therefore, by dividing farmers into homogeneous groups or recommendation domains, one is recognizing:
* The heterogeneity that exists in the farming population.
* The likelihood that farmers, within a group, will have similar problems.
* The increased probability that farmers within a group, will be interested in the same potential solution to the identified problem(s).
Thus, the purpose of the groups is to highlight similarities within the recommendation domains and the differences between and among the recommendation domains. Similarities and differences are important only with respect to the objectives: increasing agricultural productivity by establishing experiments and generating recommendations. Because farm families differ from one another, it is important to distinguish the characteristics on which they vary, how those variables relate to the problems they have, and the usefulness of solutions to resolving those problems.
In the descriptive/diagnostic exercise, as will be seen later (see Section 5.7), one of the purposes is to tentatively define the potential recommendation domains, although these may need to be adjusted in the light of later experience. An interesting short-cut that does not require a very precise definition of recommendation domains is the use of research-oriented farmer groups. These are discussed in a later section (see Section 9,8,6), Briefly, this involves offering to the farmers a number of technologies, from which they select those they are interested in testing. The characterization of the group selecting the option provides a quick indication of the possible recommendation domain for the proposed technology and reduces the chance of possible errors in the definition of the recommendation domains.
BOX 4.3: SOLUTIONS MAY DIFFER FOR FARMS WITH THE SAME PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAI. PROBLEM
An underlying problem for all farmers in arid and semi-arid zones is the limited availability of water for plant growth. Consequently, a key management factor is their ability to perform timely operations in order to make water available for germination and plant growth and to improve the efficiency of water use.
The ability to pursue 'timeliness,, however, is not a function of management alone but also of resources available to farmers. For example, in Southern Africa it is much easier for a farmer owning a tractor to carry out timely operations than for a farmer hiring donkeys. Although the problem for both farmers is the same, the potential solutions for helping them will be different. Therefore, in much of the FSD work, such farmers have been allocated to different recommendation domains.
Some FSD workers have found, on the other hand, that recommendation domains in their farming systems tend to conform to geographic differences (e.g., soil type, climate, and so forth) and less to resource differences between farmers. This was the case for dryland farming systems in India [Walker and Ryan, 1990].
BOX 4.4: EXAMPLE OF A GENERALIZED RECOMMENDATION DOMAIN
Over the years, one FSD team in Botswana did a great deal of crop variety testing for stationbased researchers, One example is the cowpea variety ER-7, which has now been released officially, In the case of this variety, there was no need to differentiate the farmers according to different socio-economic groups. Rather, the appropriate recommendation domain appears to be all farmers in a particular geographic area (i.e., eastern half of Botswana which has the best rainfall).
4.6 Participatory research
During recent years, the farming systems approach has shifted dramatically from an emphasis on farmer based but researcher managed studies towards methods that stress farmer participation, or say, in the research process. The question asked is 'who is best positioned to lead an inquiry into a farming system'?'. Farmer-based, researcher-managed studies are necessary when [Shaner et al, 1982: p. 19]:
"Farmers may not have adequate technical explanations of their problems nor know the range of opportunities for improving their conditions, but [that] learning more about farmers helps the researchers produce better technologies and extension workers promote FSR results more effectively."
However, participatory techniques have proven very useful in allowing farmers to express themselves on a wide range of issues. In the extreme, the purposes of a participatory orientation could be simply to organize a voice for farmer concerns and to impact on political decisions. Another focused objective might be to establish nearly autonomous farmer groups that can be self-motivated and self-directed in problem-solving investigations, But, in practice, most participatory activities involve some balance, or a partnership, between researcher management and farmer say in the research dialogue,
The justification for shifting towards participatory techniques lies in the need to give farmers or groups of farmers the freedom to conceptualize and express an accurate model of how their farming system works, Participants can synthesize and exploit a comprehensive farm model in terms of systems structures, processes, and farm objectives certainly more efficiently, and often more effectively, than can FSD teams who study the system from the outside,
When embarking on greater farmer participation, FSD can choose to invite farmers to manage or comanage all or only some stages of the research effort, These stages might include: descriptions of the system, diagnoses of constraints, designs of new options, pre-screening or other assessments of options, selections of options for actual testing, reporting assessments of options to FSD, and even taking charge of disseminating useful information to other farmers.
The role of FSD team members in participatory research usually is not reduced. In tact, it may require a greater awareness of issues (i.e., farmers sensitivities, social customs, and technical understanding) than in more researcher managed work. In participatory research, FSD members should search out ways to:
* Facilitate the articulation of the participants' positions -- often consensus of a group.
* Present hypotheses for discussion or testing.
* Link discussions with information from secondary sources that is not being taken into consideration by the participants.
* Communicate findings to outside agents.
* Link findings to the larger agricultural research and development context.
* Bring outside decision makers (e.g., research, extension, development, and planning agencies) directly into the participatory process.
The correct balance between participatory methods and farmer-based, researcher-managed methods must be determined by the FSD team based on what is appropriate for each activity. The choice should be for the method or combination of methods that will give the greatest problem-solving efficiency. The choices, especially when a large degree of uncertainty exists about the issues and about the types of responses that can be anticipated, might be arrived at through an iterative process in which FSD teams routinely re-evaluate the techniques in their work plan.
Farmer participation is discussed or implicit under a number of the specific methodology sections of this manual. Obviously, a strong participatory role occurs in informal survey work (Chapter 8) and more particularly for PRA in Section 8.4. A range of participation in trial management is discussed with emphasis on how this participation corresponds to the objectives of the trial (Sections 9.2 and 9.3). A participatory mode is greatest in FMFI trials (Section 9.8.5). Farmer groups (Section 9.8.6), listed under trial management methodology, are actually useful participatory forums to address essentially all stages of the research effort. Participatory evaluation objectives are discussed under Section 1().3.
Part II - Implementation of the farming systems development approach
This part furnishes a broad but systematic view on how to successfully set an FSD programme in place. The two chapters in this part deal with the following:
* The steps involved in implementing FSD (Chapter 5).
* Operational issues involved in implementing FSD (Chapter 6).
5. Operational steps
5.1 Objectives of the chapter
The objectives of this chapter are to:
* Provide an outline of steps needed in FSD, This information will provide ideas on types of implementation methods, data, and analyses required,
* Evaluate the linkages between various steps.
* Describe the desired links between FSD team members and other 'actors' at different steps in the FSD process.
* Describe criteria that permit decisions on when a step can begin.
5.2 Step involved in FSD
Although earlier FSD was conceptually broken down into stages (in Section 3,2), it is important to recognize that, in implementation, the boundaries between the stages can become quite blurred, especially because the FSD team may be working at different points on the continuum for different technologies. For example, the FSD team may still be in the design stage for a technology to address a particular problem but in the final level of testing with respect to a second technology, while continuing routine diagnostic work,
Before FSD can actually begin, sites for conducting research must be selected. Then the list of the steps involved in FSD should include:
* Selection of target areas and sub-areas.
* Selection of research areas.
* Selection of villages.
* Selection of cooperators.
* Description and diagnostic-stage activities.
* Design-stage activities.
* Testing-stage activities.
* Dissemination-stage activities.
Aspects relating to each of these steps are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. Some of the material on the steps builds on Zandstra [1985: pp. 168-172].
5.3 Selection of target areas
5.3.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
The selection of target areas usually is completed before FSD team members have been assembled to begin organizing FSD work. Because FSD output should feed into long-term planning and development, it is best if a framework for planning national development is defined before the selection of target areas for FSD is made.
Generally, the selection of a target area for a FSD programme is made by national decision makers, usually in Ministries of Agriculture or their equivalent,
5.3.2 Details on the Selection of Target Areas
Two reasons often used for selecting specific target areas are:
* To meet the needs of the people living there and/or
* To take advantage of the agricultural potential of the area.
If conditions within the target area vary substantially, it can be subdivided on the basis of similar physical, biological, socio-economic, and farming systems characteristics.
Criteria considered in the selection depend on the purpose of establishing the FSD programme. This purpose may be to deal with a specific part of the country or specific agricultural problem, such as low productivity in rainfed agriculture, or to be an on-going segment of the national research organization, dedicated to on-farm research. Whatever the purpose of the farming systems effort, the criteria considered may include compatibility with national policy and priorities and/or may be based on physical limitations or problems, such as poor water availability and distribution, erodible slopes, flooding, or animal disease.
Answers to the following types of questions can help assist decision makers in selecting target areas:
* Is the target area large and relatively similar in those environmental characteristics that have the most bearing on potential research results? If so, the FSD team can apply the research results broadly and meaningfully within the target area.
* Is the target area similar to other areas? If so, some of the technologies developed in the target area can be used in other areas.
* Does the area have the potential for rapid pay-off from FSD? Factors that often determine the potential are:
* Physical and biological conditions,
* Markets and infrastructure,
* Available technology, and
* Farmers' willingness to accept innovation,
* Do the area's environmental conditions facilitate application of technologies developed elsewhere? If so, the time period for reaping returns from the FSD process could be shortened greatly,
* What are some of the cost factors? For example, is the target area now served by existing governmental programmes or private institutions? If so, cooperation with such programmes or institutions could enable the FSD team to accomplish more, reduce costs, and/or save time.
5.4 Selection of research areas
5.4.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
After the target area has been chosen, a research area or areas within the target area will be identified. This selection is usually made by members of the FSD team as one of their first activities in the field, The selection process, however, will usually be improved through close consultation with government and non-government agents involved in agricultural development in the research area,
5.4.2 Details on Selecting Research Areas
The following factors can be important considerations in defining a research area(s):
* Representativeness of the Research Area. This is usually the most important criterion for selection of a research area, It must be representative of the target area or sub-areas with respect to environmental conditions -- that is, physical, biological, and socio economic -- and the farming systems practiced,
* Accessibility. The ability to travel easily to all parts of the research area generally will enhance cooperation between the research team and farmers, allow for easy distribution of inputs and access to markets, and reduce the team's operating costs. However, with respect to this, it is important to take into account the types of issues raised in Section 5 .5 ,2,
* Existence of a Nearby Agricultural Research Station. Research areas located close to research stations generally have more cooperation between on-station and off-station researchers and can provide a more integrated approach to the overall research programme (i.e., enable the synergism between the reductionist and systems approach to be fully exploited -- see Section 3.5).
* Cooperation of Farmer Contact Agencies and Leader Support. Good working relationships with agencies operating directly with farmers, such as extension and development agencies, can increase the effectiveness of the FSD team. This is particularly important when such agencies must be relied upon to provide information, inputs, credit, etc. Help and support from formal and informal leaders at the national and local levels, can be critical to the success of the FSD programme,
In order to make an informed selection of a research area within a target area, a good deal of information must be available to the decision makers, Table 5,1 identifies many of the data categories necessary for research area selection. Many of these data can be collected by the FSD team from secondary sources, such as existing reports, aerial photographs, etc. Additional information can be obtained by spot visits in the proposed research areas and/or reconnaissance type surveys (see Section 8,4), The final decision about the research area often involves input from national, regional, district and local level government officials, as well as from the FSD team, Research area selection may take as little as two weeks when relevant data are readily available, or it may take six weeks or longer when several areas are being considered, secondary data are scarce, or there are other problems. l

5.5 Selection of villages
5.5.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
As is the case for selection of the research area, village selection usually is made by the FSD team as part of beginning FSD work, Close consultation with, and advice from, senior agricultural officials in the region and other informed regional, district, and local officials in making this selection is preferable and even necessary, if information for making these selections are to be complete and verified during early periods of FSD work in an area. Decisions after the beginning phase of FSD to abandon work or initiate activities in new villages also should be made by the FSD team in consultation with appropriate advisors outside the team -- see discussion under Section 5.4.
5.5.2 Details on the Selection of Villages
An important point in selecting villages in which to concentrate FSD activities is to improve the efficiency of research resource use. This 'clustering' of research activities in a limited number of villages has become important as research resources have become more limiting, because it can often substantially reduce recurrent expenditure.
BOX 5.1: BIASES IN VILLAGE SELECTION
Obviously, it is important to be sensible and practical when selecting villages in which to concentrate efforts. However, Chambers [1986] in a challenging, but valid, critique concerning biases that impede outsiders' contact with rural poverty, notes that one of the six he discusses relates to the use of vehicles. This bias, which he calls spatial bias, involves the tendency for rural development practitioners to concentrate activities near urban areas, near tarmac, and close to roads. Obviously, such a strategy in village selection, if carried to the extreme, would seriously reduce the ability of outsiders to develop strategies appropriate to the whole rural population.
FSD teams generally will use several criteria in selecting villages within the research area. These may include factors considered in choosing the research area (Section 5.4). Some of the more important considerations are:
* Representativeness. This is of primary importance because, if the villages selected for research are not representative of the target and research areas, technologies developed to be applicable to these villages may not be transferable to the larger research and target areas.
* Logistical Considerations. These considerations are particularly important. The number of villages to be selected for research activities may well be limited by the number of field staff who will be available to the farming systems team, the ease of access to the chosen villages, their proximity to one another, etc. Trade-offs may be necessary between the desirability of selecting certain villages for representativeness or other factors and the need to limit village numbers or locations because of resource constraints faced by the FSD team (see Box 5.1).
* Characteristics of the Village. In addition to being representative in physical, biological, and socio-economic senses, some other characteristics may be important, such as availability of markets, the presence of an extension agent, etc.
* Other Factors. Other factors may be considered in a particular village selection. For example, if several villages are to be selected, it may be desirable to select a 'traditional' village, a 'progressive, village, and a village that is in 'transition' because of its location on a main roadway (see Box 5.2), The team's assessment of local support, both by local officials and by farmers, also may be important.
BOX 5.2: POPULATION- AND MARKET-DRIVEN AREAS
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria recently commenced work in two benchmark study areas in the northern part of Nigeria. Three villages have been selected in each benchmark study area differing in certain characteristics such as accessibility. The benchmark study areas also were selected on the basis of significantly different criteria, one being deemed primarily as market driven and the other being characterized as being primarily population driven. Obviously, strategies for improving the productivity and sustainability of agriculture in the two areas are likely to differ because of differences in the exogenous factors (see Section 4.2), which influence the way in which the resources, such as land and labour, are used.
The selection of villages is based on much of the same data used to identify the research area (Table 5.1). This information is collected from secondary sources, from discussions with extension and other government officials, and by direct observation. Background information must be relatively recent to be of most value. information from extension personnel who have worked in the area for five or more years and from leaders (i.e., formal or informal) who have lived in the village for 1() years or more is usually most valuable, Team members should do at least a 'windscreen' survey of potential villages. More satisfactory results may be obtained from interviews with key community members and officials and possibly from a more formalized rapid reconnaissance survey. The assessment of local support can take place during these visits.
When the information is collected, the team is in a position to make a decision, If numerous villages are being considered, a matrix of each village's characteristics, according to key factors, can be constructed. For example, what is the average land holding in the village? This then can be ranked in relation to the mean for the target area. After all factors are ranked for each village, the rankings can be totalled and, based on the factors considered, the village with the lowest total is the most representative of the target area, This type of assessment of quantitative factors may be of assistance to the farming systems team in making village selection but must be modified in light of qualitative information available to them, The existence of already defined recommendation domains (see Sections 4.5 and 5.7,2) can greatly reduce the amount of effort necessary and implies that there is a good deal of existing (ex ante) knowledge of the area.
Once research village(s) have been selected, FSD activities obviously will tend to be concentrated in them, This is particularly true if the field staff are permanently stationed in the village, because housing, etc., may have been provided by the project, However, reasons sometimes arise for changing villages, These might include:
* The discovery that the village is not representative, at least in certain key characteristics,
* Evidence that past research activities have changed the character of the farmers and the village, so the present research activities are not taking place in a 'typical, environment.
* A change in the mandate of the FSD team.
* A change in the resources available to the FSD team, requiring a corresponding change in team activities.
* Philosophical reasons such as the desire to provide exposure of the FSD to a larger number of farmers.

5.6 Selection of cooperators
5.6.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
The final step in identifying individuals to be interviewed or individual fields for experimental purposes is the selection of participating farmers. This selection is made by FSD team members but often may be improved by consulting with local authorities, agents, etc. The importance of a team approach to this selection (i.e., interdisciplinary selection process) cannot be overemphasized.
Participating farmers need to be selected at the beginning of every season or at the start of any new research initiative. Whether these participating farmers or cooperators are part of a repeat core of collaborators in the village or are new selections is a question that each FSD team must resolve based on the needs of the research programme.
5.6.2 Details in the Selection of Cooperators
The cooperating unit may be a dwelling unit, a farming household, or specific members within a household. A representative farmer is one member of a group of farmers within a recommendation domain, having similar circumstances for which one can make more or less the same recommendations (see Section 4.5).
In selecting farmers to participate in formal interviews or in hosting trials, the FSD team may use several criteria. As with the selection of research areas and research villages, the most important criterion for choosing farmers is their representativeness. The farmers selected must be as representative of the area's average farmer as possible, to allow for extensive use of the results. However, they also may be chosen to be representative of farmers in a particular recommendation domain or target group. In the latter situation, farmers with certain characteristics are preferred. These characteristics may be: the gender of the head of the household, a wealth factor (e.g., number of cattle owned), the type of draught used and whether the draught is owned, specific characteristics of the type of land farmed or animals owned, etc. These factors can be used to stratify a sample to ensure representation by both male and female heads of households, by wealthy and poor farmers,
etc.
For certain types of work, problems can arise from using a farm household (i.e., a group of people eating from one pot (see Section 4.3) consisting of a unit composed of multiple dwelling units, with their own lands, and linked by extended family and/or other ties) as the research unit. The choice of an appropriate research unit may be an important consideration in selecting cooperating farmers. The dwelling unit may be more appropriate than an entire family compound, if members of the dwelling unit operate somewhat independently in their agricultural activities. This question is related closely to the one of intra-household division of labour and decision making (see Section 4,4.1 ), For some studies, the head of the household may not be the most appropriate cooperator, particularly if some other family member has responsibility for, and decision making power over, the particular activities of interest (Box 5.3).
BOX 5.3: THE APPROPRIATE COOPERATOR MAY NOT ALWAYS BE JUST THE HOUSEHOLD HEAD
Households may contain independent decision makers, thus complicating the issue as to whom attention should be focussed on with respect to different technologies, For example, in Senegal, fields under the control of households have traditionally been divided into common and individual fields. The common fields controlled by the household head provided food for all members of the family. Increasingly, because of stresses and strains in complex household units (i.e., traditionally composed of more than one nuclear unit -- husband, spouses and other dependents), an increasing proportion of fields is controlled by individuals, However, because of poorer access to labour and improved inputs -- which are usually channeled through the household head -- yields of crops are often lower on such fields than on the fields under the control of the household head, For example, with respect to groundnuts, Venema [1978] found that yields were lower on fields controlled by individuals (i.e.
particularly when they were women) than on those controlled by the household head). He attributed this partly to lower labour inputs and poorer timeliness with respect to field operations (i.e., particularly dates of planting and first weeding),
Consequently, in such a situation, strategies for improving the productivity of groundnuts perhaps would need to be differentiated according to who controls the field, thus influencing the choice as to who is the most appropriate cooperator. Obviously' however, in the process of such selection, it is important to have the explicit support of the household head, if the main cooperator becomes someone other than the household head himself/herself.
The interest, willingness, and ability of farmers to cooperate are also important selection criteria. Farmers may be interested and willing to cooperate, but they may not have the resources to participate, or they may face conflicts in the use of resources if they do participate. Also, the head of household may be willing to participate, but not some other members of the family who will face an adverse situation if the family participates in the FSD effort. Thus, FSD teams selecting farmer participants must make sure that all members of the household, who may be affected by the household's participation, are willing to cooperate.
Logistical considerations are also important in selecting trial or interview participants. To facilitate visiting participants, particularly at their fields, the FSD team may choose to select farmers from one or two geographical groupings of fields or select participants to reflect groupings or communities within the village. Farmers belong to communities within villages that are linked by family, social, and/or economic ties. Participants in such communities are often located in the same general geographic area within the village, and selecting several community members not only will reduce logistical problems, but can provide additional information on linkages between households for shared resources, work, consumption, etc.
Once the FSD team decides on the criteria for farmer selection that are most appropriate for their situation, they must contact the potential cooperators and make their choice of cooperators. Most farmers will be somewhat suspicious of, and curious about, researchers entering their village. Because of the complicated social structure of most small villages, it is often important to identify village leaders and seek their support or approval. Village leaders who may provide necessary or helpful support include traditional leaders, such as the village headman, and community leaders (e.g., an influential school teacher). Gaining the support of such community leaders will often:
* Reassure the farmers of the team's intentions, thereby reducing their suspicions and encouraging them to cooperate with the team.
* Help elicit meaningful answers from survey participants.
* Allow the team to check the accuracy of the interview data with the leaders.
Suggestions of ways researchers can gain local leadership support include:
* Explaining the project.
* Emphasizing that farmers, answers to surveys will be kept confidential.
* Stressing that no names or specific individual information will be given to other government agencies.
* Explaining how farmers will be selected.
* Keeping the leaders informed on the project's progress.
Although it is important to obtain the support of the village leadership, it is also important that the FSD team itself has a high degree of autonomy to avoid such leadership having undue influence on the types and levels of activities undertaken, the farmers involved, etc.
Farmers to be surveyed or to host trials usually are selected from some kind of a list of farmers in the village. Devising such a list is often a challenge (see Sections 8.4.4 and 8.5.3).
Once an FSD team has selected a group of farmers to participate in a survey or to participate in an on-farm trials programme, there is a tendency to work with the same group over a period of years. This has both positive and negative effects. Working with the same farmers provides information over time, which is useful in identifying changes in the system. On the other hand, the farmers may become atypical of the average farmer in the area because of their contact with the FSD team. Thus, it may be important to change the group of cooperating farmers for some surveys (e.g., particularly single purpose surveys) and for some trial work. Whether a change in cooperators is necessary depends on the objectives of the trial or survey and numerous other factors, such as whether the farmers are still representative. It is also important to consider updating the list of farmers from which cooperators are chosen, either randomly or purposively, on a regular basis. This is particularly
relevant it. the list is several years old and if substantial in- or out-migration has occurred in the village.
Finally, in selecting farmers for on-farm trials, it is important to match farmers with trials that suit their farming system in terms of resources, preferences, and management abilities. How well a farmer will carry through on a trial may depend on perceived benefits associated with the trial. Thus, the more appropriate the trial is to the farmer's circumstances, the better are the chances that it will be completed,
5.7 Descriptive/diagnostic
The objectives of the descriptive and diagnostic activities are to:
* Develop a basic understanding of how the farming system is operating within the research area.
* Use this information to identify problem areas or areas of under-utilized potential that could benefit from change. These may differ for different farmers, therefore, requiring preliminary identification of recommendation domains.
To put it more simply, in order to introduce change, it is first necessary to understand what farmers are doing, and why they are doing it in a particular way. Then, in the diagnostic activity this information can be used to identify areas within the farming system where improvements can be made.
5.7.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
Descriptive and diagnostic research begins even during the study conducted to evaluate and select sites for research. FSD team members also will want to exploit all pertinent information already collected at the time FSD work is initiated. However, many formal descriptive and diagnostic studies will begin after research sites have been identified fully.
Descriptive and diagnostic research is never completed fully (Box 5.4). However, because FSD work must proceed to subsequent stages of research (i.e., design and testing of technology) as rapidly as possible, formal descriptive and diagnostic research is likely to peak in the earliest phase of FSD work in an area, At a minimum, however, informal descriptive and diagnostic research continues to re-evaluate the hypotheses formulated before technologies are designed, Descriptive and diagnostic research also can be on-going for special subject areas even years after work was started.
In the classic model, FSD team members generally have written up descriptions and diagnosed priority constraints. Station-based or other visiting scientists have assisted with diagnostic activity in selected subject areas. Far too often, descriptive and diagnostic research has ended with narrow disciplinary oriented perspectives of constraints (Box 5,5). It is imperative that all disciplines, including farmers, collaborate to provide an integrated analysis at this stage (see Section 10,2). Increasingly, FSD teams are asking farmers to take a more proactive role in identifying constraints (e.g., see matrix scoring and ranking in Section 8,4.4) and potential solutions (see Section 5,8).
BOX 5.4: CONTINUOUS DESCRIPTIVE/DIAGNOSTIC WORK IS NECESSARY WHEN RAPID CHANGE IS OCCURRING
The first diagnostic-stage analyses of the Adaptive Research Planning Team in Western Province' Zambia (ARPT-WP) tended to be formal and deal with the local fanning system as though it were static and as though problems identified today would remain as such into the future [Kalonge and Lof, 1994]. This diagnostic approach failed to account for significant evolutionary changes occurring in the economic, social, and political environment of the country and in the adaptive responses within farming to these changes
Zambia is implementing a structural adjustment policy to deal with its economic problems. One response of farmers to these changes is to diversify their mix of enterprises and move away from an emphasis on previously subsidized cash crops. Several specific changes are noted or predicted maize farmers face a sharp increase in fertilizer prices; rice growers face declining profit possibilities because of high transportation costs; and new opportunities are emerging for cassava production.
To address research needs in this changing environment, the ARPT-WP is developing an approach with emphasis on informal and or-going diagnostic procedures Explicit assessments using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods are incorporated into the routine activities of farm research groups (see Section 9 8 6) The purposes of this diagnosis are to monitor changes in the environmental circumstances of farmers and in household adaptations to these changes and to evaluate or forecast the impact of technological interventions in these changed circumstances. The aim is to be able to address issues for both the near and long term
5.7.2 Procedures for the Descriptive and Diagnostic Stage
These consist of the following:
* Analysis of the Research Area and Farming Systems. Once the research area has been selected, the design methodology begins with an analysis of historic events, migration flows, customs of ethnic groups, population growth rates, and development trends that are necessary to arrive at an understanding of the factors that might stimulate or impede activities rerquired for the improvement of the production systems
* Definition of Development Objectives in the Research Area. One basic consideration is to determine how important the production system under study is within the area (e.g., how important is a sorghum-millet-cowpea food crop system with animal traction in the region?). Secondly, it is important to consider the reasons behind the particular form of the existing production system. Too often, the diagnostic phase provides information on the systems, form, without an understanding of why farmers do or do not utilize par ticular technologies, for example, why don't farmers use row planting, or produce fodder crops when these practices have been promoted extensively'? If one does not properly understand the current situation, solutions that are developed to help farmers overcome their problems/constraints are unlikely to be attractive/relevant to them.
* Analysis of the Production System or Sub-System to be Modified. This step generally includes three levels of analysis:
* The first is to consider outside or exogenous factors that have an impact on the system. These often explain certain characteristics in the system, such as disease occurrence? genetic potential of livestock, etc.
* The second is structural and refers to an inventory of land use, structures, and equipment.
* The third focuses on the way the system functions and, thus, addresses the management of the production system and the interaction of the production system under consideration with other systems on- and off-farm, It is at this point that constraints to production and flexibility in the farming system are determined. Critically important in this exercise is obtaining the opinions of farmers themselves as to their problems (Box 5.5), In tact, farmers are often able to pinpoint problems that would take researchers a long time to discover. Simple qualitative modelling of the system also can be a potentially useful approach to help structure understanding of researchers at this point.
Just to identify the problems or areas of potential improvement is not sufficient (Box 5.6). To help farmers solve a problem, a researcher would need to have a clear understanding of the source of the problem.
The information sought during the diagnostic activity usually involves collecting more details on specific questions that come out of the descriptive activity. These details most commonly need to be collected in the field. While examining problem areas in detail in the field, researchers also should try to assess how widespread and severe particular problems are among the target group. Questions like: how often the problem occurs over years, how many farmers it affects. does it have a severe impact on production and incomes etc., need to be answered. This type of information is necessary for deciding what problems or opportunities are most important and for setting the priorities of the research programme. The issue of setting research priorities is discussed in more detail later (see Section 6.5.2).
* Preliminary Definition of Recommendation Domains. At this stage, the team is interested in identifying a maximum percentage of the potential target population in a minimum number of stratifications, The stratification of domains usually starts with factors relating to the technical element such as climate and soil, but also includes factors relating to the socio-economic element such as farm size, family labour supply, distance to markets, control of traction, etc.
BOX 5.5: DIAGNOSING AND RANKING OF PROBLEMS CAN BE BIASED
Busch et al [1983] in a survey of 1,400 American agricultural scientists discovered that the major determinant of why they concentrated on specific research projects was that they enjoyed doing them and that demands raised by clients ranked 13th!
Even if researchers do want to respond to clients' needs, the approach is often wrong, Box [1989: p. 61] reports a revealing incident as follows:
"When we had just met, Virgillo stood up and said: 'Lucas, I understand you want to know. You are a scientist and you want to know, But there is only one way to know what I know about cassava. Speak with me; don't speak to me like others did. Ask me about my life and I will tell you about cassava.' "
This lack of truly interactive communication combined with a degree of arrogance, often results in researchers diagnosing and ranking problems differently from farmers, and from each other when more than one discipline is represented, This is well illustrated by Hawkins [1994] based on work in China, Ghana, and Tanzania, Also, of course, women often are likely to rank problems differently from men, Inappropriate problem diagnosis and ranking are obviously undesirable, because the chances of 'irrelevant' research resulting are high.
BOX 5.6: DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM IS NOT SUFFICIENT
Farmers in Southern Africa often do not plant in a timely manner, even though planting opportunities are scarce. It is not enough just to go to the farmers and tell them to plant in a more timely manner. It is first necessary to understand why they are not doing so. It may be because most of the farmers are sharing draught power, so that they work first on one field, then on the next. Or it may be that farmers do not have enough labour to look after the cattle and kraal them every night, so they let them wander in the bush. Consequently, when it rains, the farmers have to go and look for the cattle. So, to help farmers solve the problem of delayed planting, a researcher would need to have a clear understanding of the source of the problem.
5.8 Design
The design work involves proposing new technologies to address constraints or opportunities identified in the description and diagnostic work. Usually, the process involves the development of ideas and little field work.
5.8.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
The design of new technology or interventions follows the identification of constraints and the prioritization of these constraints. An unfortunate and tar too frequent situation occurs when design focuses on ideas that interest particular researchers but are not justified based on identified constraints.
Because there is no simple formula for generating new technological solutions, creative input must be brought to bear in whatever manner possible. In FSD work to date? visiting scientists and cooperating colleagues from other agencies often have contributed ideas to FSD stall.. In many cases, in fact, it is beneficial to have subject matter experts who can best know what is on the shelf in order to make first-round suggestions to FSD team members.
Sometimes off-the-shelf proposals are not appropriate, given farmer circumstances and FSD researchers need to look elsewhere for creative input. Increasingly, forums are being developed within FSD work in which farmers can discuss options and suggest new ideas that could be tested (e.g., see discussion on farmer group methodology under Section 9.8.6).
Experiences indicate that design should be done carefully but should not result in long delays in the FSD process. In most cases, many unknowns about new technological options can be determined in an appropriate manner during testing followed by an iterative test-redesign-test process in which the options are fine-tuned.
5.8.2 Procedures for the Design Stage
The steps involved at this stage are:
* Identification of Technical Interventions. The research team should now be able to identify a number of practices or technologies that have the potential to increase productivity, through breaking the constraint itself or avoiding it through exploiting flexibility in the farming system. The solutions identified should be related closely to the production constraints previously identified and to specific recommendation domains. Those solutions are derived mainly from three sources (see Figure 3.1): farmers; experiment station research; and, only when necessary, RMRI trials on farmers' fields. In general, no actual field research is undertaken during the design stage. However, some field activity is required in that farmers, other researchers, and extension personnel need to be consulted for ideas on improved systems and equipment. The more ideas (i.e., potential solutions) that can be collected, the better.
After gathering ideas on the priority topics, researchers and farmers need to work together to select the most promising ones for testing (Box 5.7). Researchers can use their scientific knowledge to select the theoretically best options and use the descriptive data to gauge which options are most likely to fit farmers' resources within the target areas. However, the farmers' judgement also will be Important in determining which systems are most practical and socially acceptable within the target area. Thus, the design activity should include farmers, input and interaction among scientists of different disciplines. Generally, this activity is quite informal among scientists, and informal discussion sessions with groups of farmers are good approaches for obtaining farmer input. Gathering a broad range of ideas during the design activities will increase the interest of all parties involved in the testing and will lead to a higher success rate among the technologies that are
tested eventually.
Occasionally, it may be necessary to undertake a more formalized trial/survey activity before technologies can be designed for testing. However, these take time and should be undertaken only when absolutely necessary, because they delay implementation of the testing stage. The two types of more formalized activities that can arise are as follows:
* Trials, usually done in an RMRI format, to determine cause-effect relationships about which there is some uncertainty. In this case, researchers need to improve their understanding, before they can suggest strategies for farmers to test, which will overcome the constraints that have been identified or take advantage of the opportunities that exist through exploiting flexibility in the farming system.
* Surveys to quantify farmers' attitudes or preferences are needed to help in prioritizing what should be tested. This type of survey usually is needed to identify points to include, for example, in designing equipment to be developed in prototype form for testing.
* Ex Ante Analysis of Potential Alternatives. The design alternatives can be specified as a set of proposed changes in the existing production system. The ex ante (i.e., before the event) analysis seeks to evaluate the expected biological, economic, and social impacts of making these changes. The difficulty and risk associated with crop and livestock systems make this step of predicting the outcome of a change particularly important in order to reduce the chance of adverse effects on the farmers. The analysis will require information on resources and their costs. A partial budget (i.e., looking at the changes in costs and returns compared with the current situation -- see Section 10.5.2) can be constructed for each alternative to predict its economic viability. In addition, the impact of the proposed changes on the whole farm, particularly in terms of changes in farm labour demand, cash inputs, or specialized equipment, must be evaluated. The outcomes of the ex ante
analysis can be compared with similar types of information about the existing system and with other potential production systems to determine the acceptable range of production outcomes and to see if the proposed changes are feasible. In addition, changes in the levels of inputs and management components need to be evaluated.
* Listing of Assumptions and Requirements for the Potential Alternatives. Once an alternative has been selected provisionally for field evaluation, it must be described in detail' specifying inputs required and assumptions concerning levels of management? institutional support, etc.
* Identification of Applied Research Needs. Information gaps that have been encountered in the design process. such as unspecified biological relationships, prediction of the performance of alternative management practices, or questions of farmer attitudes, should be listed. These then become the bases for a set of research priorities -- often undertaken in applied research -- and trials can be designed on-station and, if necessary. on-farm to provide the needed information.
BOX 5.7: FARMER INVOLVEMENT FACILITATES RAPID UNDERSTANDING AND SOLUTION IDENTIFICATION
McCorkle [1986; 1989], amongst others, has been involved in a number of empirical studies that highlight, in the interest of efficiency, the need to:
* Solicit local knowledge in obtaining a rapid understanding of the local production environment.
* Tap that knowledge in the process of identifying potential solutions to the problems that have been identified.
She has also emphasized another advantage of using such knowledge which is that it is not only technical in nature but also is sociological. Knowledge of the latter can be particularly important in deriving locally relevant solutions.
In one paper, McCorkle [1989] gives two examples from her own experience (i.e., striga from Niger, and salty soils in Tunisia) where researchers could have saved a great deal of time and resources through consulting farmers at the appropriate time. In the same paper, with an example from Bolivia, she illustrates the need to complement farmers' knowledge with that of researchers. The Bolivian example involves livestock diseases. An earlier paper [McCorkle, 1986] developed the case for ethnoveterinary research and its potential value to livestock scientists.
5.9 Testing/implementation
Once the best ideas have been selected, they will need to be tested. The ultimate objective of FSD is to produce new technology options that will be used by farmers to increase their productivity and incomes. It is very important that researchers keep this objective in mind during the testing activities, because it determines the type of testing that is carried out.
5.9.1 Scheduling of Tasks and Key Actors
When moving from design to testing, care must be taken not to overextend the testing programme. It is very easy to design more solutions than can be tested in a satisfactory manner.
FSD team members need to be certain that the experimental interventions can be implemented in a manner that will not cause undue risk to environment, farm operation, or community well being. Otherwise, there is usually little reason for delays at the design stage (see Section 5.8). Nonetheless, a firm basis is needed for interventions selected. In the case of divisible inputs (i.e., chemical fertilizers), the appropriate level(s) to test may be in doubt. Where 'best bet' information can be obtained from station-based research or other secondary information, this might be used and testing could begin, Otherwise, technical and economic trials, which are part of the design stage, may be required before proceeding to farmer testing.
Proceeding to farmer testing should be an interdisciplinary team decision. In farmer-implemented trials, particularly within a farmer group format, the decision to accept a new option for testing is really that of the farmers. This acceptance or rejection is part of the testing process.
Evaluation of test results is primarily the responsibility of the FSD interdisciplinary team and the collaborating farmers. The integrated analysis of these results needs to include an assessment of technical feasibility, economic viability, social acceptability, and above all a farmer view point.
The role of station-based researchers and other resource individuals from outside of FSD is often critical in order to complete these evaluations when FSD staff or the farmers lack a particular expertise ,
Evaluation of test results is followed by a decision on further on-farm research or complementary station research and perhaps proposals on necessary adjustment of the policy/support system, which collectively will hopefully eventually culminate in the release and dissemination of new technology recommendations.
BOX 5.8: TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE APPROPRIATE TO THE RESOURCES AND PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT OF FARMERS
In the semi-arid areas of Southern Africa, it is well known that winter ploughing will help to increase crop grain yields. But farmers who use animal traction do not apply the system, because the soil is too hard for their animals to plough during winter, For them, the option is not practical.
Most farmers know that applying phosphate fertilizer will increase their crop yields. When fertilizer is given to them free, they are very happy to apply it, However, when they have to purchase it, they know that unless the rainfall is very good, the increase in grain yield will not be enough to pay for the fertilizer. So they do not buy it. In some years, it is not profitable.
5.9.2 Procedures for the Testing Stage
Steps involved at this stage include:
* Testing the Technologies. New production systems must be examined from a number of different perspectives. First of all, the new options must be examined to see if they do, in fact, as a result of addressing the identified problem(s), increase farm production, make farm production more reliable and/or improve the output per unit of the most limiting input (i.e., profit ability). Additionally, because of the differences between research stations and farms, the new options must be shown to be effective under actual farmers, conditions, as well as on the research station. In fact, this is one of the reasons for on-farm testing -- of which there are a number of types involving different levels of farmer participation. But for farmers to use them, new options also must be practical, that is, technically feasible, profitable, and socially acceptable and must fit within the resources that farmers have available (see Box 5.8).
To try and ensure acceptability, representative farmers must be included not only in the initial design but also in testing activities. Farmer groups -- both research- and extension-oriented -- can be used to implement testing of technologies by farmers on their own (see Section 9.8.6). The opinions of these farmers need to be carefully considered, and, if necessary, the technology should be modified before it goes to the dissemination phase.
* Improving the Applicability and Acceptability of the Technology. The first important point to make with reference to this topic is to emphasize that the results from the evaluation procedure determine whether a recommendation is made for extending the technology through the extension service. It is now accepted generally that both technical and formal socio-economic evaluation are important, although FSD workers increasingly advocate paying more attention to farmer assessment.
However in drawing up recommendations, it is important to bear in mind that there is a great deal of variation in the natural (i.e.' technical) environment that farmers face and in the socio-economic characteristics or resources they possess. In spite of this variation, standardized technological packages often are recommended. It is not altogether surprising that, where technological packages have been disseminated, many farmers have adopted components rather than the complete package. In such cases, often little advice is available on what farmers should do. For example, should they use top dressing of fertilizer when they don't weed? The return from the limited research resources can be improved by:
* Incorporating conditional clauses, which state what to do under circumstances different from those originally envisioned in the recommendation. These deviations could be attributable to the farmer, weather conditions lack of availability of some of the technological components, etc. Included in the conditional clauses are possible variations, such as recommending a step-wise approach to the adoption of the different components of the package (i.e., a type of technology ladder) and suggesting a number of options for the farmer to pursue.
* Including targeting information showing under what technical and socio-economic conditions the technology being recommended would be most applicable. For example, a particular technology may be most suitable for one soil type or for farmers with a specific resource base. For instance, as will be seen later (Section 10.8), in Botswna, double ploughing is most appropriate on soils that are reasonably deep and have a fairly high clay fraction, whereas the rotary injection planter is most suitable for farmers who do not have good control over draught power.
Thus, in recognizing the diversity of farmers, FSD can help in developing targeted and conditional clauses for proposed improved technologies. In a sense, these guidelines indicate how greater numbers of farmers can more closely approach the optimal situation.
* Try to Ensure the Appropriate Policy/Support System is in Place. Too often, technologies are not adopted because the policy/support system required is not in place or it is operating ineffectively. Many FSD workers used to believe that a 'submissive' approach should be taken with respect to policy/support system parameters, and that no effort should be made to influence their change. Obviously, this places major constraints on the types of relevant technologies that could be developed. Now fortunately, FSD workers increasingly believe that a more 'interventionist? approach should be taken with respect to the policy/support system. Technical and socio-economic information relating to trial results under farmer conditions can, and should be, used in influencing changes being made to the policy/support system to ensure that technologies have a better chance of being adopted. If this is the intention, then the sooner the potential support of those responsible for designing
and implementing the policy/support system is obtained, the higher will be the chances of success. This potential support is obtained best at the design stage, whereas at the testing or, at the latest, the dissemination stage, the objective is simply to ensure that the appropriate policy/support system is put in place (see Box 5.9).
<section>6</section>
5.10 Dissemination and impact
Involvement by FSR (i.e., technology oriented) teams in the dissemination process traditionally has been very limited. This is because extension/development agency staff obviously play the major role in such activities, The FSD approach, on the other hand, emphasises that the FSD team should play certain specialized roles to improve both the efficiency of the research process and the rate of return from the limited research resources,
The FSD team can support dissemination activities by monitoring rates of adoption and the impact of changes resulting from dissemination activities, which can help not only to justify future funding for agricultural development activities but also to provide ideas on future research priorities and, if necessary, indications on adjustments in the policy/support system that to facilitate greater adoption and/or more favourable impact,
5.10. 1 Scheduling Tasks and Key Actors for Dissemination Activities
Within FSD research areas, there may not be a decision to release a particular technology. However, farmers who have been exposed to the idea through trials work, farmer groups, or field days may choose to try to adopt on their own.
To move past the research area into the larger target area, usually the following two decisions are required:
* The FSD team must have determined that using the technology provides a significant benefit in the recommendation domain indicated.
* A national or regional ministerial or equivalent level body usually would review test data and officially release the recommendation (see Section 10,7).
Dissemination at this point usually involves a different set of actors with FSD playing more of a supportive role, Typically, the extension service takes the lead, with government agricultural policy makers playing a lesser or greater part in the effort, However, other government and nongovernment agencies and, not least of all, farmers from
BOX 5.9: POLICY/SUPPORT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE TREATED AS VARIABLES, NOT PARAMETERS
Upton and Dixon 11994] stress the importance of FSD in policy and programme analysis and the critical complementarily between development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and policy/support systems. They cite an FSD exercise in a maize-based system in Haiti [Martinez et al, 1991], in which significantly different responses to nitrogen were found from different types of fertilizer. Consequently, because of these findings, plus a number of demonstrations, it was possible to bring about a change in fertilizer marketing policy as a result of presenting the findings to the appropriate authorities. The state-sponsored agricultural input organization made the more effective type of fertilizer available to farmers. the research area can be involved in this process.
BOX 5.10: KEY TO INTERACTIVE LINKAGES IS COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES
In Botswana, for example, FSD teams have helped in training courses for extension/development agency staff and have helped extension/development agency staff train farmers in row planting via courses and competitions at agricultural shows, Row planting has been recommended officially for many years. These types of collaboration are arranged easily when Regional Coordinating Committees are functioning (see Table 6.2).
5.10.2 Details on the Process of Dissemination
Steps involved at this stage include:
* Supporting the Dissemination Process. Once technology options are released for dissemination, it is up to the farmers themselves to decide whether or not to adopt them. Extension/development agency staff have the major responsibility for informing and helping them in this process, If FSD teams are involved at all in the dissemination process, it should be purely in a supportive role, Some effort in this activity often can be justified in the interests of establishing good interactive linkages with extension/development agencies (see Box 5,10),
* Assessing Impact and Adoption. A distinction can be made between adoption studies per se and research impact-assessment studies that have enjoyed increased popularity as of late. The latter are cost/benefit studies that measure the internal rate of return to money invested in research efforts compared with the benefits of that research (i.e., both the level of adoption and benefits to producers who adopt).
With reference to adoption studies, the increasing need for FSD teams to incorporate a monitoring/feedback activity has been mentioned earlier (see Section 3.7) and an introductory discussion on the methodology for adoption studies is presented later {see Section 10.9). Points to note with reference to adoption studies are:
* Adoption studies, which are still relatively uncommon, have another important unexploited dimension. Assessment of reasons for non-adoption and/or adoption in unanticipated ways provides a potentially fertile area for feeding back relevant research priorities to researchers and information to help those responsible for the policy/support systems. With reference to the latter, such information can involve marketing (i.e., both inputs and output), credit, and extension data, which can indicate how to modify policy/support systems in a way that will improve farmer adoption.
* FSD is often in an ideal position to assess impact of research efforts generally. Because of the sunk costs already incurred in developing and disseminating specific technologies, implementing adoption studies (i.e., preferably with the support or active collaboration of extension/development staff) can yield substantial returns with relatively little additional investment, thereby improving the impact of on-farm research.
With reference to the internal rate of return to research, specific points to note include:
* The issue of the cost effectiveness of research is an important concern of many decision makers. Related to this is an increasing need for accountability in the use of the limited resources available for agricultural research, This alone provides sufficient justification for the implementation of technology adoption studies.
* However, in this type of impact-assessment study, several factors (i.e., research and non-research) need to be considered, including all research inputs used in developing the technology including both station-based and on-farm components, policy issues that may pose a constraint on adoption and yet affect the impact of research assessment, and the effectiveness of the information delivery system (i.e., extension programme).
* In this type of assessment, FSD is likely to be only a collaborator along with station-based researchers, possibly extension staff, and agricultural policy makers.
6. Operational issues
6.1 Objectives of the chapter
The objectives of this chapter are to look at some general issues in Implementing FSD. These include:
* Interdisciplinary cooperation.
* Establishing FSD linkages with other 'actors, in the agricultural development process.
* Issues relating to leverage and handling constraints.
* Issues relating to limited research resources, including assessing the level of understanding required and setting priorities.
6.2 Interdisciplinary cooperation
What factors are important in creating conditions that will encourage an interdisciplinary approach'? Obviously, an important necessary, but not a sufficient, condition is the presence of representatives on the FSD team of more than one discipline -- preferably both technical and social. Although the choice of disciplines represented on FSD teams should be influenced by factors such as the major enterprises in the farming system and the major problems/constraints that are to be addressed (i.e., sometimes related to the mandate of the institution in which the team is located), in fact, more practical constraints such as research resource limitation or staff availability are often the major determinants. Most FSD teams consist of crop-oriented scientists (i.e., particularly agronomists) and agricultural economists. Disciplines sometimes, but not always represented, are animal science and sociology. Representation from other disciplines is often obtained on a part-time basis,
as and when required, from thematic researchers.
Multidisciplinary teams obviously enable a multidisciplinary approach (i.e., individuals of different disciplines working independently on the same or different research topics) to be used but they do not, without further action, ensure that an interdisciplinary approach (i.e., individuals of different discipline working together on the same research topic) is adopted. The preconditions for an interdisciplinary approach to work rely heavily on personal characteristics of the team members. The team members must have compatible personalities, have confidence in using the analytical tools of their own disciplines together with a healthy respect for the role of other disciplines, and be willing and able to be team players. Above all, they need to be able to listen, understand, and accept other viewpoints and be prepared, when appropriate, to modify their own views. Finally, whoever the team leader is, it is important that he/she tries to exploit the strong aspects of the team
members' personalities and minimize the negative impact of the weak aspects that everyone possesses. On balance, competence and personality rather than a specific discipline? are more important in the selection of a suitable team leader.
It is important to emphasize at this point that, unless these personal characteristics are present, interdisciplinary cooperation will not be possible. The following organizational and activity considerations simply help to create a more formalized structure that will nurture and support interdisciplinary work.
The keys to operating effectively in an interdisciplinary mode are:
* Ensuring good communication between the team members.
* Assuming joint responsibility in planning, implementation, analysis, writing, and disseminating the results of the research programme.
* Making sure that recognition for work done is distributed equitably,
With reference to the second point, this does not mean that everyone should contribute equally in all individual activities, but rather, in terms of the overall effort, everyone should play his or her part, Obviously, the roles and skills of specific disciplines and individuals should be taken into account in the apportioning process, For example, the agronomist is likely to take major responsibility for RMRI work, whereas the agricultural economist plays a much more visible role in FMFI type work. Also, one team member may have special administrative or analytical talents that can be exploited constructively for the benefit of the team as a whole.
Strategies that have been found to be important in team building and encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation include the following:
* Holding regular team meetings, both formal and informal, to discuss both administrative and professional matters. Outside representation is sometimes useful in helping the team think through issues, in providing specific expertise, and in encouraging the development of linkages.
* Equitable sharing of administrative responsibilities. This is particularly relevant in cases where teams are very small and having a specific team leader may be of little advantage.
* Careful coordination of the planning, implementation and evaluation of the various items in the work programme. Because most items in the work programme are likely to involve more than one discipline, attention to the following points can be very important:
* The work plan that is developed should result not only from discussions between the team members but from interaction with the extension- and development-oriented personnel in the region, station-based researchers, and, of course, farmers.
* Well before the agricultural cycle starts, the following should be written down and agreed to: the objectives; a justification for doing the work: and the approach to be used for each proposed trial, survey, or study, in the work programme. The justification might include a description of how this activity fits into the stages of development of the technology.
* At this stage, someone should be designated to take primary responsibility for the trial, survey, or study.
* Additionally at this time, any special materials for the proposed trial, survey, or study should be obtained; any necessary support from farmers should be enlisted; and agreement should be reached on the data collection procedure and forms that are to be used and on the possible analytical framework for evaluating the results.
* Finally, at this stage, responsibilities for different activities with reference to the specific trial, survey, or study should be apportioned. Some of these activities or responsibilities will be done jointly. A protocol for the list of activities, the name of the person responsible for supervising them, and the expected dates of completion should be drawn up for each trial, survey, or study in the work programme. Such a list is desirable to facilitate communication and to help ensure successful implementation of the work programme. This can be supplemented during the implementation stage by a checklist indicating, by farmer for each trial, the dates on which the various activities were undertaken.
* Analysis and writing up should be done in a timely manner and joint authorship of papers encouraged,
* After approval by the relevant authorities, the results of the work should be distributed in a timely manner to interested institutions and individuals.

6.3 Linkages
Obviously, as already emphasized, FSD teams themselves do not have all the expertise necessary to undertake FSD work. Thus, FSD is very dependent upon contributions by people outside the teams. At least three groups of people have important roles to play in helping to plan, implement, evaluate, and use the results of FSD work. As mentioned earlier (see Section 2.4), in addition to the obvious ones, farmers, these are station-based researchers, extension/development staff, and planners.
Although these linkages are important, the relative contribution that each linkage will make depends on the stage in the FSD process. In Figure 6.1, the relative contributions at each research stage are indicated schematically. However, it should be borne in mind that a number of research activities generally are occurring at the same time, some of which are likely to be at different stages in the research process. Therefore, linkages are likely to be Important all the time.
Figure 6.1: Contributions of various "actors" at different stages in the FSD process
A key principle behind any linkage activity is to be sure at the outset that all parties:
* See the benefits of specific activities.
* Benefit from, and receive credit from such activities,
* Make some commitment in terms of approval, effort, and/or resources to ensure that they take place.
With reference to the last point, commitment or cooperation can be thought of at three levels, namely.
* The minimal degree of cooperation required would be consultation and 'approval, of activities that may be of interest to, or have an impact on, other 'actors, before their implementation.
* The next level would be to get the other interested parties to provide resources to help defray expenses of activities that have linkage connotations.
* Obviously, the most desirable commitment would be for direct collaboration for staff on both sides of a linkage each to devote staff time to common activities.
Therefore, in nurturing linkages, it is important to observe the above points, Even the first one is better than nothing. Obtaining, the blessing of other potentially interested parties before undertaking activities has proven to be far superior in terms of winning acceptance of the results rather than discussing them only after their completion, The latter approach often results in a 'them versus us' stance, which does not engender an attitude of mutual help, cooperation, and collaboration. Thus, the above principles are important in ensuring the development of mutually beneficial interactive linkages -- the focus of the next three sections.
6.3.1 Links to On-Station Research
Earlier discussion indicated the complementarily between FSD and station-based research (Section 2.3). Mention also was made that collaboration between the two groups was likely to result in two approaches to FSD, that is FSD 'with a pre-determined focus' and FSD 'in the small, (Section 3.3). Obviously, collaborative activities represent the most intensive form of interaction. This is the most desirable form, because it eliminates the division between the two groups, thereby minimizing the probability of miscommunication and improving the chances that the results will be accepted by all concerned (see Box 6.1). However, as can be seen in Table 6.1, there are various degrees of collaboration. Also, there is some potential overlap between the various activities. For example, participation in the research programme team meetings can result in visits by station-based research scientists to the field to see plots, address farmer groups about specific technologies, and cooperate
in joint trials.
6.3.2 Extension/Development Linkages
The value of the interaction between FSD workers and extension/development staff can be summarized as follows:
* Extension/development staff possess substantial knowledge about the area where they are posted and know many of the farmers personally, This local knowledge is invaluable to FSD teams in their diagnostic, design, and testing work.
* FSD workers interact with small numbers of farmers -- hopefully representative of a much larger number of farmers -- whereas extension staff have a mandate to work with all farmers. In a sense, the extension service provides a conduit for FSD teams to reach farmers as a whole. Therefore, interaction between FSD teams and extension/development staff can help provide a multiplier effect for FSD work, can assist in providing extension/development staff with relevant messages to disseminate, and can help extension staff in developing appropriate methods and systems for disseminating technologies to farmers.

BOX 6.1: COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES BETWEEN STATION-BASED AND FSD RESEARCHERS ARE PREFERABLE
A technological package for cotton was tested in Northern Nigeria and proved to be unsuitable, because it involved substantial labour inputs at a time of the year when farmers wished to concentrate on their food crops, However' there was immediate acceptance of this preference by the station based cotton researchers, who collaborated with FSD staff in testing the cotton package with the farmers. As a result, attention focussed on developing a cotton technology package that fitted in better with the farmer priorities (i.e., could involve planting later to avoid the labour bottleneck for food crops) and eliminating the need of large amounts of water for spraying with the help of ultra low-volume sprayers [Beeden et al, 1976; Norman et al, 1974 and 19751.
Thus, extension staff can make constructive contributions at all stages of the FSD process, although, as indicated in Figure 6. 1, the relative level of contribution will vary.
FSD teams usually are located in research institutions that are separated from institutions responsible for extension/development. In spite of control being exerted 'vertically' in most institutions, some 'horizontal' linkages usually can be developed, as indicated in Table 6.2. The activities involved once again imply various levels of commitment and can result in promoting further collaborative efforts. Once again, there is considerable potential for the overlapping of activities. For example, consultation activities may lead to collaborative activities, whereas FSD participation on a supportive basis in dissemination-type activities may lead to new items for the research agenda.
6.3.3 Support Systems and Policy Linkages
As indicated earlier (Section 2.4), important factors influencing whether the productivity and the welfare of farmers will improve are the policies that shape the economic environment in which they operate. Many policies influence production decisions by farmers. The influence of these may be direct or indirect. For example:
* A policy decision to distribute sorghum seed but not cowpea or groundnut seed through the government distribution system directly influences farmer decisions.
* Most policies indirectly influence farmer behaviour through their effects on input prices (e.g., through subsidies) or product prices (e.g., through marketing boards).
Obviously, such policies not only influence the farmers, but can also have an impact on what constitutes relevant agricultural research. FSD programmes can provide information to the policy makers that may be used to create new policies to enable farmers to adopt relevant improved technologies (see Box 5.9).

For example:
* On-farm trials may demonstrate the potential pay-off to a particular input that is not currently available. This information can be fed to the policy makers to convince them to make that input available.
* Information obtained from on-farm work with farmers can identify possible discrepancies between stated policy goals and policy implementation -- thereby alerting the policy makers to the changes that are required.
In general, however, linkages of FS teams with those responsible for both developing and implementing policy/support systems still remain poorly developed (Box 6.2). Both linkages deserve and need greater emphasis at two levels: regional and central (see Section 3.6).
6.3.4 A Case Study: Institutionalization of FSD Activities in Botswana
The FS approach has become institutionalized within the NARS in many countries throughout the world. Although FS activities have had a long history in Botswana, institutionalization has occurred fairly recently (i.e., late 1980's). For illustrative purposes, the institutional set-up in Botswana is described, where it is still called FSR. However, to be consistent with the terminology in the rest of the manual the term FSD is used in the following discussion.
For many years in Botswana, FSD activities were donor financed and largely donor controlled. With institutionalization of the FSD approach, three significant changes took place:
* All the FSD teams were placed under the Department for Agricultural Research.?
* Greater domestic responsibility for funding FSD activities made control by the Director of Agricultural Research easier to exert.
* FSD-related activities developed much closer relationships with the other 'actors in the agricultural development process, especially with the station-based researchers.
BOX 6.2: INCREASING REALIZATION OF VALUE Of LINKAGES BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND PLANNERS
Although very rarely formalized, linkages between FSD researchers and planners appear to be evolving. For example, in Tanzania, meetings between planners and FSD economists have been organized; in Botswana, FSD teams have been asked by planners to help in evaluating development programmes; and in Bangladesh and Kenya, recommendations have been made in development projects for linkages to be strengthened between researchers and those involved in input distribution and product marketing.
With reference to the last point, the current administrative arrangements are as follows:
* The top level administration in the department consists of the Director of Agricultural Research, Chief Arable Research Officer (CARO), and the Chief Animal Production Research Officer (CAPRO). The office of the director provides direct scientific and administrative leadership to the overall research programme and helps in defining its objectives. Thus, the office is also responsible and accountable for decisions relating to overall strategy, research policy, and resource allocation with respect to research.
* The second level of the administrative structure occurs at the programme level, At the national level, there are a number of Programme Committees that are headed by Programme Leaders. Such Programme Committees exist under the offices of both the CAPRO and the CARO. For example, the CARD's office includes six programmes, namely:
* Cereals Crop Improvement Programme.
* Oil Seed and Small Grain Improvement Programme.
* Soil/Water Management and Agricultural Engineering Programme.
* Horticulture Crop Improvement Programme.
* Grain Legume Crop Improvement Programme.
* Production Systems Programme.
The programme activities are directed by Programme Committees, to which the Programme Leaders are accountable, The functions of these Programme Committees are to:
* Evaluate research proposals in terms of their potential practicability and relevance in addressing a specific need and compatibility with the overall research programme.
* Monitor and evaluate on-going projects and make decisions relating to priorities, continuation, and/or phasing out.
* In the Botswana context, the Production Systems Programme (PSP) constitutes the FSD thrust. Currently, four regional teams with Regional FSD Team Leaders are in place and are located in different agro-ecological zones. The Programme Committee for the PSP is composed of the National Programme Leader, who is the chairman, and the Regional FSD Team Leaders together with other senior scientists within the PSP.
Although the regional FSD type teams operate somewhat independently of each other, all have functions in common, namely:
* On-farm testing with farmers of new technologies developed by other programmes or from on-farm research activities,
* Feeding back information from on-farm testing, farmer opinions and needs, and possible research priorities to station-based researchers in other programmes.
* In addition to developing interactive linkages with on-station researchers, being responsible for developing interactive linkages with development-oriented staff and agencies operating in their own region (e.g., extension, NGO's, cooperatives, etc.).
The National Programme Leader of the PSP provides a vital interactive linkage between the Regional FSD teams and the station-based programmes. In support of this, the National Programme Leader of the PSP and the Programme Committee of the PSP play critical roles in terms of disseminating information, helping decide on the appropriate research priorities and methodologies, and apportioning the research resources available to the PSP.
Given the special requirements of FSD type work and the fact that staff relating to activities under the PSP are geographically very widely dispersed, the National Programme Leader of the PSP has two other major responsibilities, namely:
* Ensuring that staff at both the junior and senior level are trained adequately. Field assistants usually are trained in situ at in-service training courses, whereas appropriate short and long term training opportunities are sought for technical staff [Modiakgotla et al, 1991].
* Ensuring that staff have adequate access to scientific information. Libraries are usually not available in areas where the regional teams operate. Thus, the National Programme Leader maintains a list on all the literature available and circulates this list to all staff members who select material they want. Selected material then is photocopied and sent to them.
The Regional FSD Team Leaders, as indicated above, are responsible not only for the on-farm research programme in their areas but also for liaison with development-related activities in their areas. There are two formalized mechanisms for facilitating this.
* Regional Coordination Committees (RCCs) (Table 6.2) have been established, chaired by the Regional Agricultural Officer (i.e., the most senior extension staff in the region), to provide a formalized means for efficient interaction not only between research and extension but also with marketing board personnel, NGO's and Cooperatives operating in the area. Because all agricultural research and development-oriented staff interact with farmers, there is considerable merit, whenever possible, for coordinating activities. This helps in ensuring that there is consistency in the information provided to farmers and avoiding duplication of effort. The composition of the committee is determined by the agencies that prevail within each region and are interested in agricultural development. At these meetings, the Regional FSD Team Leader presents the results from the last year and provides a workplan for the next year, for comment and discussion. These meetings also provide a forum
for discussing regional agricultural development problems and for seeking practical solutions. In conclusion, the RCCs provide a useful conduit in ensuring a coordinated approach for implementing government initiatives at the regional level.
* The District Development Committee (DDC), chaired by the District Officer, is not confined to agricultural matters but is concerned with all developmental issues in the area. Consequently, in addition to members from Agriculture, there are representatives from Water Affairs, Health, Labour Affairs, Community Development, etc.
Finally, the Regional FSD Team Leader also is invested with a high degree of accountability for research resource allocation and utilization, He or she is also accountable for obtaining results for the region and for effective monitoring and feedback,
Although the above administrative setup does have considerable merit and operates reasonably well, there are also obvious problems. These basically stem from the appropriate split between coordination and control from the centre or from the periphery. Three problems that are by no means unique to Botswana are as follows:
* Programme Leaders do not have complete control over their own budgets.
* Programme Leaders do not have total control over staff in their programmes, because staff members within programmes can be transferred unilaterally between programmes.
* Because the contact person on FSD issues is the Director of Agricultural Research, all incoming requests still need to go through him, thus often delaying action.
In spite of some problems relating to the current administrative setup, which are inevitable in any NARS, it is a significant improvement over the situation in the late 1980's in terms of accountability and constructive interaction.
6.4 Leverage and handling constraints
The two approaches of FSD mentioned earlier (i.e., FSD with a 'pre-determined focus' or FSD 'in the small' in Section 3,3) have different implications for the degree of leverage obtained in the system and for the problem of breaking constraints versus exploiting flexibility in the system, This section briefly examines these topics.
6.4.1 Leverage
FSD workers obviously are interested in maximizing improvements in the productivity of the farming systems being implemented by farmers, which hopefully will lead to improvements in their welfare. To accomplish this, it is important to identify the parts of the farming system where adoption of a change can have the greatest positive impact on productivity. In such a situation, potential leverage on the farming system is maximized.
High leverage interventions involve introducing changes in an operation or enterprise in a part of a farming system that is a major absorber of farm resources and/or where the timing of those resources is restricted. All other things being equal, the adoption of technologies that improve the productivity of such resources is likely to maximize improvement in the productivity of the farming system as a whole. Low leverage interventions, on the other hand, may not have a major impact on the productivity of the farming system as a whole, but may help in improving the productivity of a particular enterprise, Such interventions involve less change and are sometimes likely to be more acceptable to farmers (Box 6.3).
One issue relating to this is whether to focus research on a pre-determined commodity (i.e., FSD 'with a predetermined focus, ) rather than on the whole farming system or on the crop subsystem (i.e., FSD 'in the small') (see Section 3.3).
When research is undertaken in which the pre-determined enterprise in question is a major absorber of farm resources, then that enterprise usually will offer the best leverage on such system-problems as deficient income, excessive risk, and seasonal variability in the use of farmer owned resources. In fact, this approach with a small ratio of variables to parameters is methodologically much easier to undertake than one in which the ratio of variables to parameters is much larger. Geographically based FSD teams have the responsibility for looking at all crop and livestock enterprises in the system. Usually, the most leverage can be obtained with the major crop or livestock enterprises. However, this still is a complex situation when viewing the relationships between the various enterprises. Certainly, focusing on the broader farming system is advisable when there appears to be little scope for improvement by focusing solely on the farmer's major enterprise .
BOX 6.3: LOW-LEVERAGE INTERVENTIONS CAN HELP ADDRESS INTRAHOUSEHOLD INEQUITIES
Women are often responsible in many African countries for minor crops (i.e., often for home consumption purposes) and own small amounts of livestock (i.e., particularly chicken, goats and sheep). Helping women to improve the productivity of these socalled 'minor enterprises' can help improve their well-being and their position in the household, although the impact on the household as a whole may be limited.
6.4.2 Breaking Constraints or Exploiting Flexibility
There are two possible ways of dealing with an identified constraint: break the constraint or avoid the constraint by exploiting the flexibility in the farming system. For example, in a situation where sorghum is affected by a particular disease, numerous strategies could be applied to deal with the problem. The constraint may perhaps be broken by applying a seed dressing (i.e., requiring an input distribution system); breeding a disease-resistant sorghum (i.e., a long-term strategy requiring an input distribution system); or exploiting the flexibility in the farming system by planting the sorghum at a sub-optimal time, in terms of yield potential, to reduce or eliminate the disease attack. The decision on which approach to use in dealing with the constraint will depend on its severity, the flexibility of the existing farming system, and the availability of potential Improved strategies that break the constraints or exploit the flexibility. Breaking a constraint is a much
more difficult problem, for both researchers and farmers, than the strategy of exploiting flexibility. However, major long-term increases in productivity have to come through breaking constraints. This must be a step-by-step approach moving away from the present system towards a new one -- each step being one that is acceptable and absorbable by farmers.
In fact, if one looks at the success of FSD to date, it generally has been most successful in more equable climates than exist in Botswana -- which is given as an example in Box 6.4. Examining the relative success of FSD in equable environments shows that much of it can be attributed to exploitation of flexibility in the farming system -- often requiring only minor changes on the part of the farmer -- rather than breaking constraints, Technologies involving exploiting flexibility in the farming system thus are more likely to be adopted spontaneously and are less likely to require strong policy/support systems and rigorous farmer training programmes to encourage their adoption (Table 6.3). Thus, effective interactive linkages between research and those responsible for designing and implementing policy/support systems are critically important in creating conditions conducive to agricultural development, particularly in harsh climatic areas,

6.5 Research resource considerations
Maximizing the return from the limited resources available for research must always be a major consideration. Two areas that are important in ensuring that research resources are allocated in an optimal manner are considering very careful the level of understanding that is required -greater accuracy often requires more research resources - and ensuring that the research priorities selected are the correct ones. These two topics are considered in a little more detail in the following sections.
6.5.1 Degree of Understanding Required
At first glance? it seems that going through all the steps described above could take a great deal of time. This is likely to be the case, if an effort is made to collect at first hand large amounts of accurate quantitative-type data. However, this is not always necessary and, therefore, is not desirable. After all, collecting descriptive information is not an end in itself but is used to provide an input into designing and testing work,
BOX 6.4: BOTH HIGH AND LOW LEVERAGE ACTIVITIES CAN BE USEFUL
In Botswana, FSD teams have worked with both high- and low-leverage interventions. For example, a good deal of the work done in collaboration with the commodity researchers on the experiment station has a low leverage characteristic -- particularly in the case of an enterprise that is not a major component in the farming system. However, adoption of the proposed changes can help improve the productivity of that enterprise, in particular, and possibly have some impact on the farming system as a whole. This occurs if the enterprise concerned uses a significant proportion of the resources involved in implementing the farming system as a whole.
FSD teams in Botswana have been willing to support work with low-leverage characteristics because of the difficulty, in this harsh climatic environment, of developing interventions with a high leverage characteristic that will be adopted readily by farmers. The difficult environmental conditions provide little flexibility in the farming system, because a key management factor is the ability of farmers to plough and plant when they are likely to optimize the use of water available for plant growth and maximize efficiency of water use. Therefore, researchers are faced with the challenge of trying to develop relevant technologies to break a major constraint, rather than having the easier task of developing technologies that will avoid the constraint by exploiting the flexibility that exists within the farming system.
Under the harsh climatic conditions of Botswana, major emphasis has had to be on developing technologies that break constraints. Adoption of such technologies by farmers involves major changes in their farming systems. For example, much of the FSD work has concentrated on changing the ploughing-planting operation to improve water availability. However, strategies to improve water availability to the plant at planting time require more draught than the traditional strategy of broadcasting the seed and ploughing it in.
Therefore, in summary, a good deal of the FSD work done in Botswana 'with a pre-determined focus, tends to have a low-leverage characteristic, whereas FSD work 'in the small' tends to have a high leverage characteristic. Unfortunately, it involves interventions that have to break the major constraint of limited water availability, rather than being able to exploit the little flexibility that generally exists in Botswana farming systems.
In deciding what quantitative-type data to collect, guidelines such as the following can be used:
* As much use as possible has been made of existing secondary information.
* Very careful consideration is given to just how accurate descriptive information needs to be in order to provide an adequate guide or input into the designing and testing stages of FSD. Emphasis is placed on collecting the required information in the cheapest possible way, with a method that allows attainment of the degree of accuracy that is required. Examples of cheap methods are those that emphasize qualitative rather than quantitative type of data and relative ranking of data rather than actual accurate measurement (i.e., ordinal rather than cardinal). Also, greater interaction with, and participation by, the farmer at all stages of the FSD process can provide many short-cuts in the research process,
* Informal interdisciplinary surveys are used whenever possible to collect information required to fulfil the point above that cannot be obtained from secondary sources, The major respondents for this information are the farmers themselves, If necessary, these findings are supplemented or confirmed with a formal one-time survey that can be analyzed quickly (see Section 7,2).
* Bearing in mind the three preceding points, the amount of time taken in doing the initial descriptive/diagnostic work is minimized so that design and testing activities are started at the earliest possible opportunity.
* Descriptive/diagnostic activities to verify the initial quick descriptive/diagnostic work, if necessary, are undertaken at the same time as the initial testing stage, These descriptive/diagnostic activities can be in the form of more formal surveys and studies such as monitoring fields, etc. In fact, results arising out of design and testing activities can help in refining future descriptive/diagnostic activities. This is an example of the iterative nature of FSD work,
6.5.2 Setting Priorities
During the descriptive and diagnostic work, it is likely that farmers will articulate, and researchers will observe, more problems in the farming system than can possibly be addressed, Researchers' time and resources often are limited, so they must consider carefully how much work can be done and restrict the number of activities undertaken, Setting research priorities is a complex process and will be influenced somewhat by information and analysis arising out of the steps that were outlined in Sections 5,7 and 5,8, Four general factors that are important in influencing the setting of the research priorities are as follows:
* Farmers' objectives have a direct effect on the types of technology that they will adopt. If researchers and farmers have different objectives, a good deal of research work may end up being wasted. Therefore, it is very important, to try and find solutions to the problems farmers feel are most important. They are likely to result in technologies that have high-leverage characteristics,
* Other clients for FSD teams are station-based researchers who play a major role in providing a 'bank' of potentially useful technologies that can be considered in the design stage and used in the testing stage. Although the farmer remains the major client for FSD work, FSD teams can help in developing a more useful 'bank' of technologies by responding to on-station researcher requests to test specific potential technologies on farmers' fields. Some of these are likely to have low-leverage characteristics.
* To benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of FSD, research priorities must be set by the whole team, and not just by discipline (see earlier discussion in Section 5.7,1 ). For example, if descriptive and diagnostic activities indicate that labour is the most limiting factor in the system, then the agronomist should give priority to this and work with the economist to develop labour-saving technologies or increase the return per unit of labour used during the labour-constrained periods, rather than addressing some other topic that may be only an agronomic issue, such as rice variety yield trials. Any rice varieties selected for testing should be based on the preferences of the farming households and take into account the resources (e.g., money, labour) that farmers have at their disposal.
* The mandate and the location of the research will have an influence on setting research priorities. For example, a team may be responsible for increasing crop production among limited-resource farmers working in a particular area. Thus, the team usually starts out with some target areas and specified objectives.
Other important issues to consider when setting priorities for research include the following:
* How common is the problem within the research area, and how many families does it affect? Higher priority should be given to problems that affect most families.
* How severe is the problem and how much does it affect the productivity of the system? For example, head smut in sorghum may occur in all fields throughout a region, but the actual reduction in grain yield may be very small. Higher priority should be given to problems that have the most severe effects on farm production.
* If there is major concern about addressing intra-household relationships via the technological route, considerations mentioned under the two previous points may need to be modified. For example, helping improve the position of women within the household may involve low-leverage types of interventions that will not necessarily greatly improve the welfare of households as a whole.
* What is the potential for solving the problem? It may not be appropriate for an FSD team to tackle a problem like bird control, even though all parties recognize it as a problem. FSD teams generally should give priority to problems they feel they have some chance of solving and try to feed back problems they can't solve to other groups that have a better chance of identifying a solution (e.g., station-based researchers).
* If solutions to problems are likely to result in technologies that require new, or changes in existing, policy/support systems, then it is important to ascertain the potential attitude and responsiveness from those responsible for developing/implementing such systems. There is little object in undertaking such research if there is no hope of any changes. An analogous idea applies to research that is likely to have a long gestation period (e.g., much livestock research). It would be important' for example, in pert-urban dairy research to know the priorities of government in supporting such systems both now and in the future.
* Are there areas of opportunity for increasing farm production that are being under utilized at present? For example, could certain types of fruit trees planted around the home compound provide useful income? Not all improvements come from solving problems. Some may come from starting new and profitable activities.
Part III - Methodology for the farming systems development approach
Descriptions and 'how to' guides for a number of data collection and analytical methods are presented in this part. The four chapters in this part, which contain information for both technical and socio-economic scientists, are devoted to:
* An overview of the data collection methods used in FSD (Chapter 7).
* A discussion of survey methods and their implementation in FSD (Chapter 8).
* A review of trial methods and their implementation in FSD (Chapter 9).
* An introduction to analytical and evaluation techniques used in FSD (Chapter 10).
7. Data collection methods
7.1 Objectives of chapter
The objectives of this chapter are to:
* Briefly outline and evaluate the different methods of data collection.
* Indicate the major methods of data collection desirable at each stage of the FSD process.
7.2 Common data collection methods
Obviously, both technical and socio-economic data are needed in the development of relevant improved technologies for farmers. For example, the time spent on ploughing a field is dependent on the type of draught used and the number of hours per day that it is used. However, ploughing time also is determined by a number of technical factors, such as moisture in the soil and the soil type. Unfortunately, data collected and analysis undertaken often reflect only socio-economic or technical data. Looking at only one aspect does not represent the whole picture. Collecting both types of data is not always possible, but the limitations of collecting only one type should be recognized.
The most common methods of collecting data in FSD work are the following:
* Surveys (interviews and questionnaires).
* Observation.
* Direct measurement.
Surveys, which involve interviewing, include many different types. One possible schematic breakdown, although not perfect in that it would probably not be universally accepted, is given in Figure 7.1. It is important to note that usually, in formal (i.e., structured) surveys, only one respondent is interviewed at a time, whereas in informal (i.e., unstructured) surveys, respondents may be interviewed individually' or quite often, as a group. Direct observation, because of its expense, has tended to be used sparingly in FSD work and, when utilized, has tended to be undertaken in conjunction with other methods. Direct measurement activities often are associated with monitoring and trial activities (see Section 8.6).
Figure 7.1: Types of surveys (interviews)
A number of factors influence what method or methods of data collection are used. Some of these are:
* The discipline of the researcher(s) and the objective of the specific research. For example, historically in FSD-type work, social scientists have tended to concentrate on surveys, economists have relied more heavily of formal surveys, and sociologist/anthropologists have emphasized more informal surveying and direct observation methods. In contrast, the major thrust of technical scientists has been, and continues to be, direct measurement. Attitudinal information is collected, for example, by informal survey methods, whereas technical information concerning performance of technologies requires the implementation of trials.
* Quality and quantity of research resources available.Limited financial resources obviously limit the use of direct measurement and formal surveys involving multiple visits. At the same time, the skills involved in undertaking informal surveys may inhibit their widespread use.
* Time available to undertake the study. Surveys, particularly informal, are clearly less time-intensive than activities involving direct measurement,
* Whether the type of farming system on which the study is to be undertaken is complex or simple (e.g., year-round versus seasonal farming, mixtures versus sole stands of crops, etc.). It is difficult to make categorical statements on the relative ranking of the data collection methods, although assuming all other things to be equal, direct measurement and observation are likely to yield the most accurate results in more complex systems.
* How important it is to reduce sampling error. Basically this means that a sample chosen from a population does not perfectly represent the population. For a number of reasons, sampling error tends to be a problem in much FSD work (e.g., because of imperfect sampling frames, use of small samples, etc). Unfortunately, the likelihood exists in FSD that sampling error, which generally means larger samples, increases the possibility of larger measurement errors.
* How important it is to reduce measurement error. This relates to mistakes in the enumeration and analysis of data. The type of data being collected determines whether a high or low potential exists for measurement errors. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2. There are two continua:
* The 'single point' to 'continuous' continuum (i.e., relating to an event or activity that occurs over a brief time span, as against one that has much longer duration).
* 'Registered' to 'non-registered' continuum (i.e., relating to an event whose occurrence and dimensions leave a written record or distinct and vivid recollection as against one less likely to be recorded or remembered).
Usually, measurement errors are lower with single-point registered data (i.e., when memory recall would be good) and higher with continuous non-registered data (i.e., when memory recall would be bad).
It is possible to subjectively evaluate the methods of data collection in terms of the above factors. In Table 7.1 the significance of each factor or operational constraint with respect to each method is given a ranking of I to 6, with '1' indicating a very favourable ranking and '6' indicating a very unfavourable ranking.

d. Single-point registered data.
e. Continuous non-registered data
Because of different disciplinary needs, as well as needs to mesh together the use of limited research resources, a strategy consisting of a combination of methods normally is used. The results in Table 7.1 show that no one method of data collection is basically superior in minimizing operational constraints.
As indicated earlier, careful thinking is required about how accurately the data must be collected (Section 6.5.1). Keep in mind that the costs (e.g., financial and time) associated with a data collection method should be comparable to the type of information sought. For example, multiple-visit surveys for quantifying actual seasonal labour flows are expensive and require a good deal of time. A rough estimate based on a much cheaper and quicker, oneshot survey, in fact, may be sufficient for the purpose required. It is important to consider whether a more accurate measurement would improve the understanding enough to justify giving up other opportunities, such as working with more farming families, As indicated earlier, depending on the type of data being collected, measurement errors are reduced with more frequent interviewing techniques, whereas sampling errors are reduced by involving larger numbers of farmers. Because, in FSD work, research resources are invariably
limited, a trade-off between these two errors is necessary.
Related to the above, and to efficiency, is the idea that cheaper, qualitative type data sometimes may provide sufficient understanding rather than expensive, quantitative type data. Qualitative information can include not only attitudinal information, but information on the relative labour requirements of different operations, etc. Limiting quantification to key characteristics reduces the cost involved in collecting data,
Surveys involving interviews are used a great deal in FSD, Figure 7.1 illustrates the different types. The most suitable type of interview will depend on circumstances. In general greater emphasis now is being placed on informal surveys to get the necessary information in a quick and efficient manner. All surveys, no matter how they are undertaken, need to be designed to facilitate quick processing so as to simplify the transfer of data to computerbased systems.
Structured interviews, using schedules with pre-coded, closed-ended questions (see Section 8.5), are potentially more efficient in this regard and should be used whenever possible, especially il.:
* The researchers themselves are not conducting the interviews.
* The enumerators are not particularly well-qualified.
* Comparative analysis, such as cross tabulation, etc., is to be undertaken.
* Statistical analysis is required.
7.3 Major data collection methods by FSD stage
Table 7.2 is an attempt to indicate the major data collection methods now considered by most FSD practitioners to be best at each FSD stage. Once again, there is a degree of personal subjectivity about the degree of importance attached to each method in each stage of FSD. Indeed, some of the weighting reflects what is considered to be desirable rather than what is currently done. As examples, multiple-visit formal surveys used to be very important in the descriptive/diagnostic stage, and a one-visit formal survey still is considered to be important by some practitioners in the same stage. Also impact/adoption studies still are not undertaken in the dissemination stage to the extent that would be desirable. Therefore, it is important to note that changes have occurred in priorities given to different methods over the years. Reasons for this relate to evolution in methodology and increasing concern with maximizing the return from limited research resources. Related to the
latter have been three considerations, namely:
* Not aiming for near perfect understanding and great accuracy but doing enough to get the job done. Attainment of such goals would involve considerable expense.
* Moving through the different stages of FSD as quickly and efficiently as possible. Obviously, this helps in improving the return from limited research resources.
* Development of better technologies but not necessarily the perfect solutions to problems. All farmers are different in some respect, and the perfect solution, or near perfect solution, is an impossible goal idealistically and practically in terms of the limited resources available for research.

Values between 1 and 5 reflect the gradient between important/desirable and unimportant/undesirable. Cells with no entry reflect little or no reliance on that method/approach.
8. Survey methods (indirect measurements)
8.1 Objectives
The major form of data collection through indirect measurement is via surveys. Therefore, this chapter concentrates on surveys, The objectives of the chapter are to:
* Provide guidelines on eliciting the cooperation of the respondent,
* Describe different types of informal and formal surveys.
* Discuss some of the issues relevant to the implementation of informal and formal surveys.
8.2 Obtaining farmer cooperation
Without doubt, in order to benefit from any type of collaboration with farmers, it is important to develop a good relationship with them, The initial approach to the farmer and the relationship that develops over time, are critical elements in creating an environment conducive to collaboration, Two points are important in developing a good relationship:
* When working in the village for the first time, the objectives of the survey, work programme, and the proposed approach should be explained to, and approval for undertaking the survey should be obtained from, the village leadership. If desired by the leadership, a presentation can be made at a village meeting. Such meetings provide an opportunity to obtain general information about the village, institutions, etc.
* It is important to respect the customs of the village. Related to the issue of respect is the need for a collegiate or partnership type of relationship to develop between the FSD workers and farmers. So often, because of differences in educational levels, a paternalistic or master/servant type of relationship develops.
There are a number of tips on executing interviews in a way that will maximize the interaction between the farmers and team members and the value of information that is obtained. Four stages in the interviewing process are [Rhoades, 1982]:
* Approach. Keep a low profile; interview when it is convenient for the farming family; whenever possible, conduct the interview at the farm,
* Warm-Up. Use a polite form of address; if necessary, make appointments to discuss the survey; take time to approach the survey topics (i.e., be prepared to talk on other topics of interest to the farmer); if desirable, indicate you are there to learn and he/she is the expert,
* Dialogue. Be natural and relaxed; let the discussion flow and be flexible with the ordering of the questions; use plain understandable language and terms farmers can relate to; make sure the questions take into account the cultural setting, avoid sensitive questions at first, and, if possible, obtain such information through indirect questioning; if the farmer can't answer a question, try rephrasing it; don't ask questions that are too abstract; observe the farmer's reactions to questions, because these may reveal a great deal about his/her concerns or reservations; remember that what people say and do may be different; record the information in writing during the interview only if the farmer does not appear to be inhibited or suspicious; don't let the interview last more than 30 to 45 minutes unless the farmer is talkative, etc.
* Departure. Bring the conversation to an end when the topics have been discussed or the farmer can spare no more time, thank the farmer for his/her time, and depart respectfully.
8.3 Formal (structured) and informal (unstructured) surveys compared
Surveys are obviously very useful and efficient means of collecting data. Table 8.1 presents, in general terms, some of the distinguishing characteristics of the two major types of surveys, namely informal (unstructured) surveys and formal (structured) surveys. These characteristics highlight the different uses and means of implementing them.
<section>9</section>
8.4 Informal surveys: features, types and uses
8.4.1 Common Features
All informal surveys have five important features or distinguishing characteristics, which are illustrated in Table 8.1 :
* There is direct FSD worker-farmer interaction because the interviews are conducted by the FSD workers themselves, with FSD workers learning directly from farmers. Existing information and direct observation are also important sources of information in an informal survey. Special efforts are made to meet those (e.g., women, poorer people' more isolated people, etc.) who otherwise tend to be missed.
* Interviews basically are unstructured and semi-directed. As a result, learning is rapid and progressive with a flexible use of methods to explore relevant issues as they arise with Improvisation, iteration, and probing. Questionnaires are not used, although FSD workers often use topic guidelines to make sure all relevant topics, on a given subject, are covered. Written notes sometimes are taken during the interviews, but the emphasis is on dialogue and questioning to obtain information.
* The data collection process is dynamic and iterative, because FSD workers evaluate the data collected and reformulate data needs on a regular basis (i.e., often daily). More than one method or source of information often is used to cross check and confirm data and to improve approximations. Also, efforts are made not to find out more than is required and not to make, because of expense, inappropriately precise measurements.
* The interviews often are conducted by an interdisciplinary team with each discipline contributing to the identification of problems and identifying and evaluating potential and actual solutions. These take into account factors influencing both the technical and human environment within which farmers operate (see Section 4.2).
* Informal surveys don't permit statistical analysis, because they are undertaken without a formal sampling procedure, do not involve obtaining responses to a standard set of. questions, etc.

Value of statistical techniques in analysis Little Great
In FSD, informal surveys have developed as a result of:
* Increasing realization by scientists that a relationship with the farmer based on treating her/him as a person with whom one could interact constructively was much more fruitful than one based on treating her/him as a object from whom one collected data to be analyzed independently.
* The increasing need by scientists to become acquainted with, and learn from, farmers.
* The need to find a method for rapidly obtaining technical and socio-economic information to help researchers in developing relevant improved technologies,
* The need to identify a cost-effective survey procedure.
There is no question that the popularity and use of informal surveys will continue to grow in the future. However, at least four critical factors will be important in determining whether this approach will be successful or not.
* Human Resources. Informal surveys will give reliable findings only if the interdisciplinary team of researchers/FSD workers is familiar with the techniques; possess interviewing, observational, and analytical skills; and can work well together in the field.
* Flexibility in Decision Making. Informal surveys can provide timely information for improved understanding throughout the research process. However, benefits from these inputs will be achieved only if the FSD programme can be structured in a flexible enough manner to permit, and react to, the input of new information as specific FSD activities proceed. FSD certainly should be able to respond in this manner, but on station research is likely to be less flexible,
* Intended Use of Information. Informal surveys are particularly appropriate whenever open-ended learning is needed or desired, but will not be appropriate when data are required over a long period of time or when more precise and statistically reliable data are needed from a large number of units. However, informal surveys can be used to better design and complement/supplement other data collection methods.
* Intended Audience. The results of informal surveys, because of their lack of statistical validity and heavy reliance on attitudinal/qualitative information, are inherently unlikely to hold much appeal to those used to relying on, and working with, quantitative data and statistical techniques (e.g., station-based scientists, planners, etc.). However, one way of often reducing such scepticism is to elicit the support of such individuals before undertaking such surveys and, if possible, persuade them to participate directly in their implementation as one of the interdisciplinary team members, Under such circumstances, they not only have an opportunity to make a contribution in theta. own right but also have a vested interest in the results, which, consequently, are likely to be more acceptable.
8.4.2 Types: General
In recent years, there has been an methodological explosion in terms of how to undertake informal surveys. Very simplistically, these new survey methods can be classified into two mayor groups:
* Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) Surveys, which sometimes are called a variety of other names including sondeos, rapid reconnaissance surveys, and/or exploratory surveys. These often are undertaken with individual respondents, although a number of respondents occasionally might be interviewed at the same time.
* Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) Techniques. such as mapping, seasonal diagramming, matrix ranking and scoring, etc. These usually are done with groups of respondents.
In considering the two types of informal surveys, a number of points can be made' for example:
* The philosophy, approaches, and methods of RRA began to develop into a coherent and identifiable form in the late 1970's, whereas most of the PRA techniques developed later.
* RRA often is considered extractive in the sense that outside professionals go to rural areas, obtain information, and then take it away to process and analyze. PRA, on the other hand, is participatory in the sense that its role is more to facilitate the collection, presentation, and analysis by the farmers themselves.
* RRA and PRA have a number of features in common such as those indicated above (see Section 8,4.1 ). However PRA has a number of features that have not been prominent in RRA including:
* Getting the farmers themselves to do the investigation, analysis, and presentation, with the outsiders simply playing a facilitating role.
* Outsiders emphasizing self-critical awareness (i.e., examining their behaviour) so that they play a truly facilitative rather than interventionist role, including that of relaxing and not rushing the farmers.
* Outsiders using their own best judgement at all times rather than relying on a manual or a rigid set of rules, and learning to welcome any errors as an opportunity to do better.
* Greater sharing of information among farmers and between farmers and outsiders,
* Although RRA and PRA differ in approach, the distinction is becoming increasingly blurred, because much of the methodology is shared. However, in this manual, RRA is distinguished from PRA in the sense that they are considered as semi- structured interviews. This often has been viewed as the 'basic foundation, of good RRA. It means having a mental or written checklist but is open-ended in approach, allowing following up on unanticipated issues and/or responses.
8.4.3 RRA: Uses and Implementation
Over the years, properly executed RRA surveys have proved to be low-cost ways of obtaining information and opinions from farmers; of tapping the indigenous knowledge and wisdom that exists on agricultural matters; and of developing a rapid understanding of farmers' circumstances, practices and problems,
A large body of literature is becoming available on the techniques of RRA. A particularly useful overview is given in Khon Kaen L 1987]. Three organizations that regularly produce information and results from the application of RRA are the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in the UK; the Forest, Trees and People (FTP) Network organized jointly by the Community Forestry Unit in FAO and the International Development Research Centre (lDRC), SUAS in Sweden; and the Information Centre for Low External Input Agriculture (ILEIA) in the Netherlands. CIMMYT was one of the earliest CGIAR institutions responsible for demonstrating the value of informal or RRA surveys in FSD activities, while the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex, UK, also played an important role in advocating RRA during the early days..
BOX 8.1: RRA IS USEFUL IN SELECTING REPRESENTATIVE RESEARCH AREAS
In Botswana, such surveys were extremely useful in initiating activities of two of the FSD teams. There was concern about the potentially high logistical costs of interviewing farmers spread over large areas. Therefore, RRA-type surveys were undertaken in the two areas to ascertain whether the needs of different types of farmers in each area could be captured by confining the bulk of the teams' activities to working with a cross-section of farmers in three villages in each region. It was concluded that the variation in the farming systems within the selected villages -- which had different characteristics, such as size, settlement patterns, accessibility to the urban area, etc. -was as great as the variation throughout the region as a whole. Thus, research efforts could be concentrated geographically.
RRA-type surveys can serve five main functions in FSD-type work:
* The Feasibility Survey. RRA surveys can be useful in planning a project in a region, particularly in cases where relatively little is known such as obtaining an understanding of the target area and in selecting the research area (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4) (Box 8.1).
* Reconnaissance Surveys to Prepare Formal Surveys. The objective of these surveys is to quickly obtain basic information for designing and executing formal surveys or more in-depth investigations that may lead to on-farm experimentation. Such surveys help in developing an understanding of the area and can help ensure that the formal questionnaire is designed in a manner understandable (e.g., in terms, standards of measurement used, etc.) and relevant to farmers' circumstances and sensitive to local issues, etc. Such formal surveys, as follow ups to informal surveys, are firmly entrenched in the methodologies of some institutions. See, for example the so-called formal verification surveys advocated by CIMMYT [Byerlee et al, 1980]. However, questions are now being asked whether in an era of increasingly limited research resources, this is really necessary, because it often simply verifies what is already known .
* Informal Surveys for the Direct Planning of On-Farm Trials. The formal survey stage is skipped and on-farm experiments are undertaken on the basis of an informal survey, which identifies problems that need to be addressed. For example, FSD work in the ploughing/planting area may evolve out of the informal surveys supplemented later with data derived from studies and formal surveys.
* Informal Group Interviews on Selecting, Monitoring, and Evaluating On-Farm Trials. Conventionally, much of the literature emphasizes the use of RRA techniques in the planning stages of FSD work. However, such techniques also have been used in the monitoring and evaluation of on-farm trials, particularly those at the FMFl level. Research-oriented farmer groups provide a particularly good forum for such interaction (see Section 9.8.6).
* Assessing Impact and Adoption. The recent increased emphasis on looking at the impact of research resources in terms of success and problems of adoption provides another potential role for RRA type surveys. As yet, this has been done rarely, but it could provide a quick and cost efficient way of feeding back issues to station-based researchers and to planners. Such surveys also could provide valuable insights in the design of more formal surveys addressing adoption.
A number of decisions and actions must be undertaken in implementing RRA type surveys. Important points to consider are:
* The major objectives of the survey need to be determined. These should be finalized after taking into account the needs and inputs of the relevant authorities and interested parties (e.g., FSD, extension/development and station-based personnel).
* The size and composition of the survey team needs to be decided. Usually, the size of the team should be determined by the objectives or focus of the survey. The more complex the objectives and the more complex the technical and human environment (see Section 4.2), the more desirable a larger team would be. In general, both technical and social scientists and, whenever possible, both men and women, should be included in teams. It is also desirable to include women on the teams to ensure that gender issues are taken into account. Also in some societies, it may be imperative to have women on the team to interview women in the survey area, Inclusion of extension/development and station-based personnel sometimes can be useful both in terms of the potential contribution they can make and the professional benefits they can receive as a result of interaction between disciplines and with farmers,
* Background information relating to the objectives and area to be surveyed need to be assembled and digested, Such information can be obtained from: reviewing secondary data -- both published and unpublished -- acquiring maps, and interviewing key informants, These are knowledgeable personnel such as local government officials, leaders, extension, and development staff who have good background information relating to the objectives and the area to be studied, The amount of time required for obtaining and digesting background information will be minimal, if the FSD team is already working in the area,
* If it is the team's first time to work in the area, then approval to undertake the survey must be obtained from the appropriate authorities, This often means obtaining the support of regional and district agricultural officials and leaders in the villages.
* It is desirable to produce interviewing guidelines, These can be divided into two groups: content and process.
* Content. These are topical lists to help interviewers address topics and aspects of a topic that they might otherwise omit, The list should arise out of a consensus among team members and should consider the objectives, background information, and prior knowledge of the area, Making the list provides an ideal opportunity for promoting team building, because it allows each team member to contribute to the list, emphasizing topics relevant to his/her own interests/discipline, As a result, survey priorities are established before going to the field, and the team begins to operate as a single unit. If possible, the topical outline should be tested prior to going to the field. However, this list should not be considered binding. Sometimes, team members may not want to pursue all the topics on the list in order to obtain more detailed information on a particular aspect.
* Process. In addition to deciding on the topics to be addressed in the survey, it is also important to agree on the appropriate interviewing procedures before starting the survey. Topics that might be useful to agree on before going to the field include: how to approach the farmer in terms of introduction; interaction, encouraging single or group interviews, length of interview, etc.; how to handle translation and sensitive topics; and how to avoid asking biased questions.
* Interviewing procedures, of course, will be somewhat location-specific. Some points that are important to take into account, in addition to those mentioned earlier (see Section 8.2) include:
* If the team is large, it is a good idea to break it up into groups of two - consisting ideally of a technical and social scientist -- to conduct interviews with a range of farmers, These farmers usually are selected in an informal manner; for example, every fifth farmer who is met or a certain number of farmers who have particular characteristics, such as being female and head of a household or who hire draught animals,
* Rotating team members on a daily basis gives each person a chance to work with and learn from other team members, thereby facilitating the exchange of ideas and helping to establish better communication among team members. It is also a good idea for the team to get together as a whole, on a frequent basis (e.g., daily), to review tentative hypotheses and compare and discuss observations and conclusions that have arisen. Also, at this point, some notes should be made, if not done earlier, to avoid points being forgotten at a later date. Such discussions can help stimulate team members' thinking and result in a modification of the topical outline for further interviews.
* At the end of the survey, which usually will not last more than a week, a written report should be prepared by team members reflecting a consensus on the hypotheses, findings -- which usually will include information on farmers' attitudes, constraints, and indigenous knowledge -- and recommendations for future action.
A great deal of FSD work has involved using informal survey methods (e.g., see Box 8.2), which include one or more of the elements discussed above. Obviously, once familiarity with the area and individual farmers has been established, many short cuts can be made in the implementation procedure, although it is always important to bear in mind some basic principles (e.g., use terms farmers can relate to, develop a collegiate or partnership type relationship with farmers, etc.). RRA type survey techniques have been used in many situations, for example:
* Consultations with individual farmers on their farms concerning the practices they are using, the trials in which they are participating, etc.
* Farmer field days in which farmers played prominent roles.
* Farmer groups (i.e., both research- and extension-oriented) where farmers out-number the outsiders (i.e., researchers and extension staff), and, as a result, often express their views quite vigorously.
These forums provide important opportunities for learning from the farmer in order to help in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating formal surveys, studies, and trials. Because a good deal of this information is not documented formally, the significance of this informal interaction in shaping thoughts and actions tends to be forgotten. indeed, it is probably true to say that many strategies developed in on-farm trials over the years have been stimulated in such discussions (see Box 8.3).
BOX 8.2: UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE AND LIMITATIONS OF RRA SURVEYS
RRA surveys, in many different versions, have been used in FSD as quick and cost-effective means of obtaining a broad overview of technical and human constraints and potentials within a farming system, McCracken and Conway [1988] list five features of all good RRA surveys: iterative (i.e. between disciplinary perspectives); innovative (i.e., fit the situation); informal; interactive; and involving appropriate members of the target community.
In the medium altitude zone of Kirinyaga District of Kenya, an exploratory RRA survey was carried out with the primary extension agents of the areas in which an FSD team was doing research [Franzel, 1992]. The purpose was to use these agents as informants to obtain a comprehensive picture of the situation even more rapidly than could be done by interacting with farming members of the community. This RRA survey did provide the comprehensive information and was rated quite cost-effective. However, the FSD team members recognized that the chance that bias (i.e., perspectives different from those of farmers) would exist among agents and go unnoticed, and that the false results might be worse than no survey information at all.
A team working in Marit village of Plateau State, Nigeria, compared findings obtained through RRA surveys and those obtained through an Intensive Residential Study (IRS) [Merit Team, 19931. Most of the key issues discovered during the IRS were confirmed by the RRA: problems with soil fertility, water quality, income potential for the young in agriculture, rural electricity, marauding livestock, and others. Priorities for the elaboration of projects in the community -- these priorities naturally would correspond to the problem areas -- also were well identified by the RRA survey. At a general level, RRA proved effective at identifying issues. However, the Marit Team found that RRA could not be relied on to reach the same level of understanding as IRS for more subtle relationships and values, For example, the RRA identified problems that informants thought could be corrected by outside inputs (e.g., fertilizer, seeds, etc.) but not those problems that surfaced over time in IRS
that would require 'inside, solutions (e.g., mismanagement of funds). In terms of values, the RRA survey results reflected more 'promodernization, thinking, whereas the IRS revealed certain traditional values that the RRA did not. These included such value issues as matrimonial happiness, respect, etc.
The RRA survey is an important tool in FSD work. It provides the broad perspectives necessary to correctly orient FSD activities. However, RRA surveys should not always substitute for further in-depth appraisal.
8.4.4 PRA: Types and Uses
As indicated earlier (see Section 8.4.2), PRA techniques are evolving rapidly. As a result, it is impossible to provide an exhaustive description of the different methods, because it would become dated very quickly. A large number of papers are being published currently on new techniques and refinements to existing methods and should be consulted by those interested. Particularly useful sources of information are the same ones cited for RRA earlier (Section 8.4.3), namely IIED, FTP Network, IDS, and ILEIA. In addition, Clark University in the USA has produced a number of informative publications in this area, while a number of CGIAR institutions have done some innovative work using PRA techniques. Those with particularly noteworthy work in this area include ICLARM, ICRAF, and CIMMYT.
BOX 8.3: FARMER-INITIATED STRATEGIES CAN IMPROVE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF RESEARCH
* In one part of Southern Africa, it was observed that many farmers recognized high potential sites on their fields where soils were deeper, had a relatively high clay fraction, and tended to be at the bottom of slopes. These characteristics create conditions conducive to high water retention, important in that drought-prone environment, Consequently, some farmers used strategies to take advantage of these high potential sites. As a result, FSD researchers also accepted the potential payoff from targeting strategies towards these high potential sites by implementing trials on manure and phosphate application.
* A couple of FSD teams did a lot of trial work on double ploughing to increase infiltration of water in the soil profile thereby improving the length of time planting can be done under optimal soil moisture conditions (see Section 10.8). Because, at times, the traditional ploughing/planting system can be effective if soil moisture conditions are satisfactory, farmers in one village indicated that they could reduce the cost of the first ploughing in a double ploughing system by doing it when the soil moisture conditions were not suitable for planting, therefore, not sacrificing potential production. This observation encouraged the FSD team to rethink ideas on the double ploughing strategy as a substitute for the traditional system. It is now viewed as an option that farmers can pursue for increasing the potential number of days in which planting can be done on subsequent rains.
The objective here is to give, by way of illustration, summaries of four techniques that appear to have particular potential in FSD type activities.
Before doing so, four important points to note about the use of PRA techniques are as follows:
* All involve having a group of respondents who together, after discussion, come to a consensus on the subject being considered. Thus, care must be taken that the respondents selected for the exercise are knowledgeable about the subject being discussed, and where results are likely to differ by recommendation domain, gender, etc., that those in a specific group are of the same 'type' or 'class'.
* They can be used effectively where the level of literacy is low. Lack of reliance on the written word appears to positively influence memory or visual retention. Such information can be transmitted effectively to others in pictorial form through drawing outlines on the ground supplemented with different objects or symbols reflecting different things/events/orders of magnitude, etc.
* Because the respondents are the major 'actors' in the activity and primarily interact amongst themselves, they can become very enthusiastic in, and derive considerable enjoyment and satisfaction from, undertaking the exercise.
* For those who doubt the results of a particular exercise, it can be repeated with another. group of respondents who have similar attributes, and the results compared.
Four examples of PRA techniques and their potential uses, are as follows:
* Mapping. Examples are of farms, residences, and/or points of major interest (e.g., wells, cooperative, etc.) in a village, Names of individuals farming each plot of land can be identified, and characteristics of households living in each residence (e.g., gender of household head, size of household, type of traction used, whether traction is owned or borrowed, etc.) can be obtained, The potential value of such an exercise is obvious in providing a low-cost and quick way of assembling a sampling frame from which stratified random samples can be selected for formal surveys (see Section 8,5.3).
* Trend Analysis. This involves use of a historical perspective and provides a way of relating changes (e.g., crops and their varieties, customs, land use and practices, ecological, etc.) and their causes to specific major events, which, in turn, can be related to specific years. Such trends, together with information relating to their causes, can obviously be useful inputs into addressing ecological sustainability issues, designing solutions that will overcome undesirable trends, providing some idea on how desirable trends can be encouraged, etc.
* Seasonal Diagramming. Examples are many and can include: amount and distribution of rainfall; specific operations by crop: level and distribution of labour (e.g., overall, by gender, etc.) by crop and livestock enterprise, total agriculture, off-farm, domestic household related; level and composition of food consumption through the year; level and composition of animal fodder through the year, etc. In these examples, levels are expressed in relative terms through comparing one part of the year with another (e.g., the longer the vertical line in relation to another, the greater is the level or amount compared with the other). When households are very close to the survival level, the they are likely to be more vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations, such as in food supplies, and less likely to be able to supplement their labour supplies at times of peak labour demand. Therefore, seasonal diagramming potentially can be very important in highlighting problems that need to be
addressed by FSD teams and in helping to evaluate the value or relevance of potential solutions.
* Matrix Scoring and Ranking. Once again, there are many examples where this method can be applied. Possibilities are farmer assessment of: different varieties of crops, livestock, fodder crops, trees; treatments in an RM-RI trial; types of soil; methods of soil and water conservation, etc. The idea is to encourage and enable farmers to debate, decide, and weight the characteristics of the different alternatives and perhaps also indicate what they ideally would like to have. The weighting is constrained? forcing them to make judgements and trade-off decisions. The procedure is as follows [Chambers, 1992A]:
* Decide what you want ranked or scored (e.g., varieties of sorghum, different treatments in a tillage trial, etc.).
* Find one or more (preferably more than one) informants who are knowledgeable and willing to discuss -- preferably from the same recommendation domain.
* Decide with them which items (i.e., under the first point above) to rank or score -- for example, if they know nothing about a particular variety, it should not be included.
* For each in turn, ask them what is good about it, what is bad about it, what else (i.e., any other point that is relevant in ranking/scoring) -- their ideas, not yours!
* List the criteria and make negative ones positive, For example, 'attracts pests' becomes 'does not attract pests'.
* Ask informants to rank or score each one (i.e., 1 = best, 2 = second best, etc. or score each out of 10, 5 or 3). This could be done visually with a matrix drawn on the ground and asking farmers to select their preferences, for example, by distributing I () identical objects (e.g.? bean seeds) between the various choices.
* At the end, ask the informants to rank them according to their preference if they could have only one. At that time they are aggregating the different criteria according to some weighting system. In fact it might also be useful to ask them to rank the importance of the different criteria. This could be done in a way Chambers calls a 'wish list, by distributing the objects according to the relative importance of the different criteria. This could provide very useful information for researchers, especially if the criteria are in potential conflict with each other.
An illustration of one such test of the approach used in India is given in Box 8.4.
Additional points that Chambers emphasizes are:
* Don't use your criteria. If you do so, clearly separate them from theirs.
* Don't lecture -- listen and learn!
* Probe for farmer criteria.
* Follow up on points of interest.
* Try different sorts of people -- who often are in different recommendation domains.
* Experience has indicated ranking is all right up to about seven items, whereas scoring is all right for any number of evaluation criteria.
BOX 8.4: MATRIX SCORING CAN BE VERY USEFUL IN RANKING EXERCISES
The following example of four women in India ranking the characteristics of different trees was provided by Chambers [1992A].

This is one of the most exciting of the PRA techniques in the sense that it has tremendous potential for obtaining farmer assessment during design and testing activities (Box 8.5) and possibly even relating to adoption in the dissemination stage. However, as implied above, this has? not been exploited to date. Also the techniques
PRA techniques are facilitating the move to practical implementation of FSD with a 'natural resource systems focus' (see Section 3.3). Staff at ICLARM have played a leadership role in applying PRA techniques to addressing such sustainability-related issues (e.g., see Lightfoot, Bottrall et al [1991] and Lightfoot, Noble et al [1991]).
In a sense, these PRA methods provide a way of quantifying qualitative type data and, therefore, potentially could be more appealing to technical scientists not associated with FSD teams, This is particularly likely to be the case once they have observed these methods in operation. These methods as well as adding an extra dimension to RRA-type surveys during descriptive/diagnostic work (e.g., see Box 8.6), could, as mentioned above, be important during the other stages of
FSD work in evaluating technologies. For example, a possible application of the matrix scoring and ranking method would be in farmer assessment of technologies tested in farmer groups. This could take the place of an end-of-season formal survey (see Section 9.8.6).

8.5 Formal surveys: value, design, and implementation
8.5.1 Efficient Use of Formal Surveys
Informal surveys can make an important contribution to the design of the more expensive, time consuming, formal surveys. However, these formal surveys are still cheaper and less time consuming than direct measurement. Formal surveys involving the use of questionnaires provide a systematic, ordered way of obtaining information from respondents and enable precise and statistically analyzable data to be obtained. Earlier (see Figure 7.1 ), it was indicated that formal surveys can be divided into single (i.e., one-shot) or few- and multiple- (i.e., frequent) visit surveys. The two major issues concerning the use of formal surveys are to ensure that:
* The benefits from such surveys justify the costs involved.
* Turnaround is reasonably quick in teens of incurring the costs and reaping the benefits.
Multiple-visit surveys with multiple objectives can yield useful information, but the research resources required -in terms of level and time -and the slow turnaround time in terms of the results not being available until much later' means that they have limited value in feeding, in a timely manner, into new research initiatives.
Therefore, the above issues have been addressed increasingly, in the following ways:
* Emphasizing special subject surveys with limited objectives rather than more general multi-purpose surveys.
* Implementing single-visit rather than multiple-visit surveys.
* Carefully considering how accurately individual variables need to be estimated in order to answer the objectives of the survey. Relative rankings may be sufficient, or if accurate measurements are required, a direct measurement rather than using a survey format may be more appropriate. Yet another alternative may be to use 'standard coefficients, obtained from other work for variables that are not critically important or are fairly predictable.
* Making sure the links between data collection and checking, followed by microcomputer data entry, processing, analysis, and writing are made as efficient as possible,
BOX 8.5: TAKE CARE WHO PROVIDES EVALUATION CRITERIA IN MATRIX SCORING
In assessing different varieties of sorghum in Southern Africa, the respondents indicated that, apart from palatability, the criteria farmers used to evaluate sorghum varieties related to yield stability. Yet sorghum breeders place a great deal of emphasis on yield level plus some degree of yield stability. When gender issues were introduced? females evaluated each of the criteria the group had selected as equally important, but the males evaluated palatability as most important and the need to do bird scaring (i.e., an activity done by women and children) as least important! There are obvious implications of using this method in helping breeders evaluate what criteria might be important to farmers in assessing varieties. The method also could be used in getting farmers to evaluate the criteria already in use in breeding programmes.
BOX 8.6: PRA TECHNIQUES CAN FACILITATE RECOMMENDATION DOMAIN IDENTIFICATION
A farm typology that is relevant to the key issues at hand is necessary to develop recommendation domains (Section 4.5) that are appropriate, PRA techniques, sometimes in combination with other methods. have been used to identify local people's own criteria for such important issues as wealth or poverty and their perceptions on how to measure differences between households within the community,
Informants were selected by an FSD team from among farmers of Kiponzelo and Kihanga farming communities in Tanzania to help with determining relevant criteria for measuring wealth as it relates to agriculture [Ravnborg, 1992], In consultation with village members, it was decided that the household would be the relevant unit of analysis for this determination.
Informants were asked first to map agro-ecological zones in the study areas, Next, names of households were written on pieces of paper, Each informant independently segregated names into different piles, If especially large piles appeared, the informant was asked to try and make divisions within just that pile. At each turn, the informant was asked to characterize the households of a pile: how they are similar among themselves and different from those of other piles. This exercise generated a set of qualitative criteria that might be used to distinguish households.
The FSD team then developed a questionnaire survey that addressed quantitative measures of the qualitative descriptive criteria that had been identified, Cluster analysis was applied to data from this questionnaire, and four categories of households were identified and characterized, Agriculturally wealthy households used improved seeds, applied chemical fertilizers, were middle aged, had large household labour pools, and consumed as well as sold relatively large quantities of maize and beans. These criteria were more important than the agro-ecological zone where the farms were located, The poorest households used fewer recommended inputs, tended to be younger or older, or were headed by single individuals. Two intermediate farm types also were characterized.
With a well organized system, it is possible to design, implement, process, analyze, and write up the results of a reasonably long, single-visit, special-subject survey of 100 households in a period of three months, half of which could be devoted to the design and implementation stages.
However, key pre-conditions for making this possible are the design of an efficient questionnaire and the ease with which a sample can be selected. Designing questionnaires, generating the sample frames, determining the required sample sizes, and selecting samples are all important ingredients in determining the value of formal surveys. These are discussed in the following sections,
8.5.2 Designing Formal Surveys
There is a logical sequence to producing a good questionnaire. The process of designing good questionnaires can be divided into six steps as follows:
* Determining Data Needs. It is first important to determine why the survey is required (i.e., justification) and, therefore, the objectives of the survey, Good definition of these then will help guide what topics need to be covered and, therefore, what the data needs are. Where information on both the technical and human environment are to be collected, determination of the data required and the design of the questionnaire itself should be a collaborative effort of technical and social scientists. Data needs should be viewed not only in terms of variables on which information is required but also in terms of the degree of precision with which they need to be measured. Making a decision at this planning stage on the type of analysis proposed can help in determining the answer to this and the cost of collecting the data.
* Determining Question Content. Three important issues to address with respect to question content are:
* Appropriate identification information and variables should be placed at the beginning of the questionnaire.
* Variables need to be included that enable the sample to be classified or stratified appropriately. Inclusion of possible classification variables in the questionnaire is important for meaningful comparative analysis to be carried out later.
* Obviously, questions must be developed for each of the variables in the hypotheses, and a determination must be made of the farmers, ability and likelihood of answering the questions, For example: questions must use terms and units of measure (e.g., for weight, area, distance, etc.) with which the farmers in the area are familiar; questions should not be used that require calculations (e.g., average bags of sorghum per hectare) by the farmers; and special care should be taken over questions that are sensitive.
* Determining Question Format. Four categories or classes of questions generally are used:
* Open-ended questions where the interviewer writes down the response in full.
* Close-ended (i.e., multiple choice) questions where the enumerator checks the appropriate response category.
* Dichotomous questions where only two responses are allowed (e.g., yes/no, sell/consume, etc.).
* Tabular questions where a question is asked after which rows and columns in a table are completed.
All have a role to play (e.g., dichotomous questions as a lead into close-ended questions, open-ended questions when it is difficult to develop a list of categories before the survey, tabular questions when there is a lot of comparable quantitative data, etc.).
* Determining the Wording of Questions. Good wording is critically important to avoid biased or inadequate responses to questions. Some examples are:
* Every question should focus on one point and have only one answer.
* Questions should be specific and not contain vague words such as many, often, and frequently.
* Every question should use terms the farmers commonly use rather than technical terms of the FSD workers.
* Every question should be phrased neutrally to avoid biasing the response.
* Questions should be phrased so that the respondent cannot determine which answer is preferred.
* Questions should specify the relevant time period for consideration.
* Some questions (e.g., on management practices) often can be clarified by increasing the similarity in the way a number of related questions are asked.
* Frequently, a pre-qualifying question may be necessary to verify that the question of interest applies to the respondent,
* Questions on management practices should be asked with respect to individual plots. A tabular question often works well in such cases.
* Questions that require accurate answers for aggregate values will be more reliable, if the amounts are first collected on an individual basis (e.g., weekly, monthly, or per parcel basis) and then summed by the FSD workers during the analytical stage,
* Each question should be numbered to aid in the processing of data. With respect to facilitating the collection-entry-analysis linkage, it is important to try to enter the data into the microcomputer straight from the survey form. This cuts down the possibility of errors in the collection-entry stage. To facilitate entry, it is good to record the name of the variable -- as it appears on the microcomputer -- on the survey form itself during the design stage and to provide a space for entering the figure that will appear in the computer (Box 8.7).
* Deciding on Question Sequence. Questions should be presented in a way that is logical from the farmer's standpoint, starting with the simple, more general questions and proceeding to the more specific, difficult, and sensitive areas, For some data, it may be advisable to check the validity of the farmers' responses by asking the question in more than one way.
* Physical Layout and Length. The beginning of the survey form, in addition to including identification and classification type information and data, also should have, where desirable, information that the interviewer can give the farmer on the purpose of the survey, who is being interviewed, etc. Any instructions on completing and coding the form for entry into the micro computer also should be given at the beginning of the survey form or at relevant points on later pages. Sufficient space for recording responses and any remarks should he provided on the survey form itself. In general, the length of interview should not exceed one hour. If it takes longer, the questionnaire should be divided and administered on separate days.
* Pretesting and Revision. After the initial design of the survey, it is worthwhile to ask interested and knowledgeable individuals for comments and suggestions for improvements. After making any changes that appear desirable, it is a good idea to pretest it with a limited number of farmers, after which changes can be made prior to its reproduction and implementation. These types of checks can help in:
* Determining whether questions are properly worded, understandable, sensitive, irrelevant, etc.
* Checking questions for adequacy of format and sequencing, adequacy of categories in close-ended questions, etc.
* Identifying missing information, estimating time requirements for the interview. testing the training and understanding of interviewers, etc.
BOX 8.7: IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY OF DATA COLLECTION AND TRANSFER
Formal surveys often are implemented by relatively inexperienced enumerators, whereas transfer of the data to microcomputer databases commonly is done by fairly unskilled clerical staff. Close-ended questions can help to reduce ambiguity data collection, whereas mistakes in transferring data to the microcomputer can be reduced by having the acronym under which the variable appears in the database, entered on the data collection form itself. An example is as follows:
(6). What type of row planter do you own'?
1. Sebele Row Planter
2. Sebele Plough Planter TYRP^a________
3. Safim Row Planter
4. Other (Specify)____________
a. This is the acronym for the type of row planter that appears in the database.
8.5.3 Sampling for Formal Surveys
There would be no need to worry about a sampling procedure, if the characteristics of all members of a population were exactly the same. It would be necessary only to select one individual to identify the population characteristics. However, because of diversity in the technical and human environment, it is necessary to sample several members of the population before any conclusions can be drawn. Therefore, the purpose of sampling is to select a subset
BOX 8.8: WATCH FOR BIASES IN SAMPLING FRAMES
The problem with many sampling frames is that they usually are drawn up for particular purposes and thus may be biased, especially if they don't represent the whole population, It is important to be aware of the possible biases when sampling frames are used. Sutherland [1988], based on extensive experience in Zambia, has identified four common types of biases, These are as follows:
* Middleman bias. When an extension agent or local leader provides a list or recommends a group of farmers, there is often a bias in favour of more progressive farmers, male-headed households, and friends or family of the middleman.
* FSD team characteristics, FSD teams may have internal biases resulting in a gender bias (i.e., favouring either male or female participants), a language bias, or an innovator bias, Also, there may be a bias because teams have a preconception, inappropriate definition, or a lack of under standing about what constitutes a farmer and/or a household,
* Logistical factors. These may be the most difficult biases to avoid and involve a bias towards farms with cropped areas near roads and a bias towards working with progressive farmers in order to show results.
* Local circumstances. Other biases can arise from local circumstances depending on the ecology, geography, and social structure of the village. There may be a bias for 'home-centred farmers', when farming is a seasonal activity, and away from farmers who leave the area for certain periods of the year in order to find of the population that has the same characteristics as the whole group or is representative of the population. The term population refers to all of the elements -- such as farms, households, etc. -- from which the sample actually is selected, whereas a sample is a representative portion of the population under study.
The objective of sampling is to undertake statistical tests and, as a result, be able to say (i.e., predict) that the results of working with all the farms/households in the population would give the same results. The sampling process requires five activities:
* Specification of the Sampling Unit. Examples would be farming households, fields of a specific type, etc.).
* Preparation of an Adequate Sample Frame. This constitutes a list of the units from which to select the sample (e.g., lists of farmers kept by extension staff; a list of people receiving food at schools/ clinics during a drought relief programme, lists of farmers participating in government production campaigns, a list of households associated with a community development project, list derived from sources outside the village, for example, a census listing, etc. (Box 8.8). Preparation of sampling frames can be very demanding (i.e., in terms of time and money). An approach that has great promise and is relatively cheap is to use PRA techniques (see Section 8.4.4), particularly mapping, in which villagers themselves can give relevant information concerning the families whose dwelling units are given on the map they have drawn.
* Selection of the Sampling Method. These consist of two major types, namely probability (i.e., random) and non-probability (i.e., non-random). Probability sampling methods consist of simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, etc. When sampling frames are not available, then non-probability sampling methods have to be used such as purposive sampling and quota sampling. Probability sampling is preferable because statistical testing is then more valid. It is desirable in sampling that strata correspond to the tentative recommendation domains (see Section 4.5). Many references are available on sampling methods, and, consequently, there is no need to discuss them in detail in this manual (see, for example, Worman et al 1 1992: pp. 137-14()1 and Dillon and Hardaker [ 1993: pp. 47-501).
* Determination of the Sample Size. This is a complicated process and often requires the help of a statistician. A number of factors influence the sample sizes used in FSD. These include: variability of local farm conditions, degree of precision required, available time and research resources, type of data handling facility, details and complexity of the questionnaire, etc. It is important to understand that the appropriate sample size depends on the variability in the population and not on the size of the population. Therefore, the percentage of farming families that must be included may vary substantially between recommendation domains. It has been found that 3() to 5() farmers for each recommendation domain usually will reflect reasonably well the circumstances of farmers in that recommendation domain [Byerlee et al, 1980]. Others have suggested a minimum sample size of 20 from each sampling category [Yang, 1965: p. 9: Shaner et al, 1982: p. 471
* Selection of the Sample. Once the preceding considerations have been taken into account and related activities accomplished, the selection of the sample can proceed. As discussed earlier (see Section 5.6.2), to ensure the cooperation of the leadership, their involvement in the actual selection process may be desirable,
In conclusion, it is important to remember the following points when making decisions about sampling:
* Be practical.
* Sample design and logistics of field work are often complementary.
* Statistical desirability and practical feasibility often conflict.
* Knowledge of the area and the subjective judgement of FSD workers is crucial in selecting villages and samples.
* Use the simplest procedure -- in terms of costs and resources -- that will permit the achievement of the FSD goal.
* Remember, biased selection of farmers will give rise to biased answers and conclusions.
* Both FSD workers and extension staff can be guilty of selection biases.
* Use probability sampling whenever possible, but in any case, always be aware of the limitations of the method that is used.
8.6 Direct physical survey measurements
Discussion in this chapter has focused on surveys involving interaction with people, However, surveys do not necessarily have to involve people, For example, FSD teams often employ direct physical survey measurements to obtain baseline and progress information that contribute to other aspects of FSD work, Basically, such physical types of surveys fall under the 'direct measurement' -- and perhaps the 'observation' -- category indicated in Tables 7,1. and 7.2, because they usually require direct measurement techniques. Consequently perhaps, physical surveys should not be considered in this chapter, which concentrates on indirect measurements that usually are associated with surveys. However, because they do constitute a special type of survey, they are dealt with briefly at this point of the chapter.
* FSD tasks that often benefit from these physical types of measurements are:
* Making comparisons with scientific data from outside the FSD target area,
* Developing sample-frames for locating trials or other studies,
* Formulating the range and the severity of problems in the descriptive and diagnostic stage of FSD.
* Forecasting impacts that interventions might have.
* Contributing to the interpretation of subjective data obtained through farmer surveys and often providing a groundwork for dialogue with participating farmers,
Direct physical survey measurements can provide more precise quantitative information about certain aspects of the farming system that arise from indirect farmer surveys, However, this level of precision is not always necessary, and for each activity, the FSD team must determine the level of precision required, In general, direct measurements are most useful for describing objects and events of the farming systems' natural resource base: weather events, soil conditions, biological cover, and so forth. In addition, direct measurements often will be made for inputs and outputs when describing cropping and livestock management.
Many physical measurements are fixed to land and calendar coordinates and, thus, can be used to help define space-time frameworks for FSD analyses, Because of problems in managing large data sets, these types of frameworks have been under-utilized in FSD.
Techniques used in these measurements are frequently the same standards used by scientists in ecological and production research. Following are several suggestions for applying direct physical survey measurements in FSD:
* The FSD team, often in consultation with experts and with participating farmers, must determine which measurements are relevant and cost effective to the analyses planned. In making this decision, consideration should be given to both short-term and long-term planning of FSD work.
* The FSD team must be assured that staff members have the skills for making these measurements in a manner consistent with established standards. The FSD team must also ensure a consistency in the way any single measurement is made across project activities, Achieving this consistency may require training for staff in the procedures used (e.g., rating weed levels, determining soil texture by 'feel' method, etc.).
* Even with training, bias can occur in the way measurements are scheduled, and this will distort the objectivity of direct measurements. Remember, essentially all objective measurement techniques depend on some amount of human judgement. It would be inappropriate, for example, for one staff member to rate weed cover -- which can be somewhat subjective -- in one village area, and another staff member to make this rating in a second, and then plan to do statistical analyses comparing these village areas.
* FSD teams will find that many standard direct measurements are too time consuming and costly to be carried on the scale necessary for project work. FSD teams should constantly be seeking proxy variables that represent the variable(s) at issue but can be measured more quickly and at less cost. Proxy variables are only as good as their relationship with the variables that are important. For example, in some environments, earthworm counts have been found to be good indicators of soil health variables such as soil porosity, aggregation, and organic matter content. Developing or validating appropriate proxy variables is an excellent subject area for collaboration between FSD and scientists based on experiment stations. Another benefit in identifying good proxy variables, is that these sometimes serve later, as well, by helping farmers and dissemination agents monitor the impact changes are having on farms.
* The use of direct physical survey measurements should not be allowed to compete with indirect farmer surveys. FSD teams may find advantages in asking participants to help assess the need for various measurements. Results should be reported back to FSD participants. Exchanging notes in this way between what farmers observe and believe with relevant scientific measurements -- from both surveys and trials -- will bolster the opportunity for identifying problems and solutions.
* Even with this potential synergism, FSD teams can readily over-extend physical measurement work. Teams might experience some difficulties in completing data collection, but a more common problem is the management of data and integration of its analysis into the broader FSD picture. Developments in data management technology will help ease some of these problems in the future. Very powerful relational database management (RDBM) programmes are becoming increasingly available that combine analysis and graphics to present results in meaningful ways.
* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, a further extension of RDBM, is also emerging as a tool with potential applications in FSD. GIS programmes and projects exist in many countries and zones where FSD teams operate. However' because work on developing initial layers of information for GIS is demanding and time consuming it probably should not be part of the work load of an FSD team. GIS programmes that are already developed and include relevant information for the target area on soils, weather, vegetation, demographic, etc., could be used and added to by FSD.
9. Trial methods (direct measurements)
9.1 Objectives
The objectives of this section are to discuss:
* The main types of trials used in FSD, the purposes of each, and some of the issues related to their design and planning,
* Some of the issues related to trials designed to address crops and livestock.
* Some of the issues involved in trial implementation, including selection and involvement of farmers and the specific use of farmer groups.
<section>b</section>
9.2 Types of trials
Once research priorities have been identified within the research programme and suitable hypotheses have been developed for testing, trials work can begin, The first requirement is for researchers -- and participating farmers, if appropriate -- to define the trial objectives as specifically as possible. This then will influence the type of trial that is most suitable for fulfilling the objectives. However, as indicated earlier (Section 2.4), FSD teams have multiple clients namely, farmers, station-based researchers, extension and development agency staff, and sometimes planners. Similar types of trials do not have equal appeal to all the clients.
One somewhat simplistic way of classifying trials undertaken on farms is differentiating them on the basis of who manages and who implements them (i.e., researcher (technician) or farmer (Table 9.1)). Thus, three major types of trials are possible:
* Researcher managed and researcher implemented (RMRI).
* Researcher managed and farmer implemented (RMFI).
* Farmer managed and farmer implemented (FMFI).

a. There is a degree of subjectivity m some of the entries in the table, but they generally reflect what is the case. In a sense, these expectations also reflect the reasons why the different types of trials are undertaken. In the literature, RMRI trials sometimes are called exploratory trials, whereas RMFI trials sometimes are termed refinement trials.
b. Standard multilocational trials are also RMFI. Multilocational trials are differentiated from trials undertaken in a farming systems context in that they are not designed, implemented, or evaluated with a farming systems perspective in mind.
c. In a sense, there are two types of FMFI trials, those done through research- oriented farmer groups
A careful study of Table 9.1 indicates that the three trial types can be differentiated in terms of research objectives, methods, experimental design, types of data collected, methods of analysis, evaluation criteria, and likely appeal to the different 'actors' in the agricultural development (equivalent to validation trials in the literature) and the more widespread testing done through extension-oriented farmer groups (equivalent to verification trials in the literature). process. Generally in FSD, technology design work begins at the RMRI level; then when a technology is thought to be appropriate, it is passed on for testing by the farmer, first at the RMFI level, and then at the FMFI level, Obviously the farmer becomes progressively more involved as one moves from experimentation at the RMRI to the FMFI level. Farmer groups - which will be discussed later (see Section 9.8.6) -- are particularly useful for implementing trials at the FMFI level and to some extent at the
RMFI level. In RMRI type trials, undertaken on-farm, the researcher input is much greater. RMRI trials on farmers, fields are most similar to those conducted on the experiment stations. Therefore, the level of testing achieved meets the standards demanded by station-based researchers. However, FMFI trials are the most satisfactory for the farmer and provide the most practical test of the technology. Because of management and resource constraints, yields or returns will diminish from the RMRI to the FMFI level. The information in Table 9.1 notes the major differences between RMRI work -mainly the preserve of experiment station researchers -- and RMFI and FMFI trials that emphasize on-farm work. One such difference, for example, is the tact that cause-effect relationships and 'hard' (quantitative) objective-type data are obtained more easily from RMRI work, whereas farmer attitudes and inputs into the research process are obtained more readily from RMFI and FMFI work
undertaken on farmers' fields, However, data collected under such formats, particularly at the FMFI level, are likely to be 'softer' (more qualitative) and more subjective in nature. Once one understands the purposes of the different types of trials, it is easier to recognize the complementarities that exist between them and? therefore, easier to adopt appropriate criteria in evaluating their worth.
All three types of trials are vitally important in contributing to a well rounded FSD programme. Yet surprisingly, a survey of 41 FSD projects undertaken a few years ago indicated that only 32% undertook all three types of trials, 12% percent undertook only RMRI trials, and only 46% undertook any FMFI trials [Barker and Lightfoot, 1986].
There is also another type of trial, called superimposed, which has considerable potential that often is not exploited fully. Superimposed trials include elements of management by both farmers and researchers, with implementation primarily the responsibility of farmers. These trials tend to be single-factor experiments such as looking at the response of fertilizer superimposed directly on a farmer's own plot where he/she is providing both labour and management. Although, not strictly correct, these can be considered a type of FMFI trial.
Mainstream FSD, in spite of the iterative principle that underlies it, often has been implemented in somewhat of a linear mode. For example, often technology design work begins at the RMRI level; then when a technology is thought to be appropriate, it is passed on for testing with the farmer, first at the RMFI level and then at the FMFI level. Obviously the farmer becomes progressively more involved, on a daily basis, as one moves from experimentation at the RMRI to the FMFI level.
It is legitimate to be somewhat uneasy about this linear connotation. Because of this and other considerations, such as the research capacity of farmers, the comparative advantage of FSD, and the need to improve the efficiency of the technology development process combined with recent methodological advances, there are strong arguments for moving in the following direction with respect to on-farm trials:
* Farmers should be involved much earlier in the research process than often has been the case to date, Good examples of where this has been done involve farmer assessment of varieties on experiment stations and farmer input into designing and evaluating treatments (Boxes 9,1 and 9,2).
* Minimal emphasis should be placed by FSD teams on RMRI type trials, FSD teams have a comparative ad vantage in trials that maximize farmer participation and assessment (i.e., trials at the RMFI and FMFI levels).
* Methods that have developed in recent years should be introduced that will enable the needs of more than one client (i.e., researchers and farmers) to be better satisfied in FMFI type trials. Farmers' needs are more likely to be satisfied as a result of their being involved as much as possible in such trials, At the same time, researchers' needs can now be better met through:
* Using methods that can express farmers' assessment in a more quantitative manner -- which will more likely appeal to technically oriented scientists (e.g., using PRA techniques (see Section 8,4.4)).
* Making greater use of alternative statistical techniques such as regression analysis including modified stability analysis (see Section 10,4,3) [Hildebrand, 1984; Stroup et al, 1991],
Thus increasingly, the objective of ensuring farmer precision in assessing whether the technology fits his/her needs does not have to be accomplished at the expense of 'statistical' precision.
* Research resource efficient methods should be utilized in implementing on-farm trials, Clustering work (see Section 5,5) and using farmer groups (see Section 9.8,6), especially in FMFI trials, are good examples of such approaches. Also relating to maximizing the return from limited research resources, the trials should be sufficiently documented (e.g., contain site descripters) and potentially relevant to large numbers of farmers (i.e., the recommendation domain should be extensive).
BOX 9.1: INTEGRATE FARMER EXPERTS INTO ONSTATION RESEARCH
In Rwanda, Sperling [1991], Sperling and Ntabomvura [1994], and Sperling and Berkowitz [1994], have demonstrated that local commodity experts (i.e., farmers) can be brought usefully onto the experiment station to participate in the early screening of experimental bean varieties, Station based researchers learn farmer and user criteria, whereas farmers make selections for on-farm experiments. Thus, women farmers and research station scientists have collaborated in evaluating the new bean lines, Such collaboration recognizes farmers' knowledge of soils, seasons, arid planting practices. After four years of testing, farmers' and breeders' selections have been evaluated in terms of farmer acceptance and diffusion. The implication is clear: involve farmers as early as possible in the research process!
Use of superimposed trials should be encouraged not only because they provide a flexible approach in responding to unexpected experimental opportunities or issues, but also because the non-experimental variables reflect farmers' actual situation.
BOX 9.2: USE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGNING TRIALS
Local knowledge about soils, paddy types, and fertilizer resources available to farmers helped in the design of on-farm trials for the Hibunawan barrio on the west coast of Leyte, Philippines [Perrot Matre and Weaver, 19921. Results from these trials led to the design of technology in the form of strategies that are more appropriate for farmers than current recommendations.
From their experiences, farmers thought that rice response was most related to the soil and paddy types and to the timing of application, especially with respect to the type of fertilizer used. None of the Hibunawan farmers applied a pre-harrowing basal application, as was done on research stations, because of the high risk of crop failure that can not be discerned at that early period in the season. Farmers also observed several rice variety and fertilizer application interactions that would be important. Their foremost concern was on how to make the most effective use of set amounts of fertilizer available to them.
Farmers and FSD workers were able to design trials that incorporated these specific questions, including trial sites, as part of the experimental design. From these trials, participants hoped to complement and adjust the farmer's own rules-of-thumb to engineer helpful fertilizer recommendations.
9.3 Functions of different trial types
In designing all trials the objectives should be specified clearly, which, in turn, will help indicate the most appropriate trial type. In order to make this determination, it is important to understand the functions of the different types of trials. These are as follows:
* RMRI Trials. This format is used most commonly in FSD during the design stage, when the objective is to determine whether a new technology will function, in a technical and biological sense, in the physical environment of a farmer's farm. Because all of the work. at least with reference to the treatment variables, is handled by researchers, the trial design can be as large and complex as is needed to answer all the relevant questions. Generally, formal, replicated designs are used in these trials. Such trials, which are designed to answer cause-effect relationships, should be carried out on experiment stations whenever possible. The reasons for this include: lower implementation costs (e.g., in terms of logistics or time) and potentially better control (e.g., in terms of easier supervision or easier maintenance of ceteris paribus conditions). However, there are occasions when conducting such trials on farmers' fields is highly desirable and sometimes even essential. Such
situations arise if the special environmental situation of the experiment station does not seem to provide a realistic environment for testing a technology (Box 9.3).
When RMRI trials are undertaken on-farm, it is desirable to have station based researchers play a major role in implementing them on behalf of? or in collaboration with, FSD team staff.
* RMFI Trials. The primary purposes of RMFI trials are to determine whether farmers can implement a particular technology using their own resources and to determine how much benefit the technology provides when this occurs, The benefit may be measured in many ways, including grain yield, net profits, cash returns to farmers' labour, net production per unit of ploughing time, etc. The participation by the farmer is essential in order to get a realistic picture of whether farmers will be able to implement the technology with the resources they possess, to develop a realistic economic picture, and to obtain initial farmer assessment of the technology,
At the RMFI level, researcher management still is required, because researchers need to collect basic data on what happens when farmers implement a new technology and on the performance of the technology, or technologies, versus the farmers' own production system. Accurate descriptions of technology performance and accurate estimates of values required for partial budget analysis (see Section 10.5.2) both require well designed and properly implemented trials and a good deal of fairly detailed data collection -- both technical and socio-economic in nature.
The involvement of the farmer has a major impact on the design of RMFI trials. It is necessary to keep in mind that the farmer is not a paid or unpaid labourer. Rather, the farmer is an independent person who is trying to run a business (i.e., the farm). Hence, the researcher should not take any more of the farmer's time than is absolutely necessary. For this reason, a good rule of thumb might be that trials should not require more than a single day for planting. If the farmer is using draught animals for ploughing, this will limit the size of the trial. The trial design should be simple enough that the farmer will understand clearly what the treatments are and how they need to be implemented.
* FMFI Trials. The primary purposes of FMFI trials are to determine how a technology will perform under farmer management and to gather extensive farmer assessments of the technology, so that it can be modified, if necessary, before it goes into the dissemination stage. Farmer assessments generally are collected through discussions (i.e., informal surveys) and through one-shot, formal, structured surveys. The more farmer opinions collected in this activity, the better, One good way to handle these types of trials is through the use of farmer groups (see Section 9,8.6). Because these trials are both farmer-managed and -implemented, they need to be extremely simple in design so that they can be implemented without any guidance from researchers.
BOX 9.3: RMRI TRIALS CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES SOMETIMES NEED TO BE ON FARMERS' FIELDS
Much work relating to weeds needs to be implemented on farmers, fields. This is because the weed complex is likely to be very different from that found on experiment stations. Examples of such work are as follows:
* Field tests were conducted on-farm in Illinois, USA, to evaluate herbicide control of bigroot morningglory (BM) [Horak and Wax, 1992], BM is a weedy perennial vine with a deep taproot and occurs in corn and soybeans, particularly on sandy bottomland. Populations of this weed occur in patches on infested fields though these fields can be scattered widely. Such patches are identified readily by farmers but are not represented adequately on research stations in the area.
* Field tests to evaluate genetic resistance to herbicide effects among populations of Palmer amaranth (PA) were conducted at numerous on-farm locations in South Carolina, USA [Gossett et al, 1992], These tests were on natural populations at their original locations, because researchers were fearful that harvesting and importing seeds to research stations might spread the genetic resistance to other populations of PA in the area.
* Leafy spurge (LS) is a serious economic problem on rangeland of the northern plains of the USA [Lym and Carlson, 1994]. Research has focused on use of biological control agents because of the long-term resurgence of this weed following treatment with herbicides. Technology development work in North Dakota, USA, was carried out on farm range sites. This work lead to a strategy of combining leafy spurge gall midge, a biological control insect that is most effective at LS control in wooded areas, with herbicide treatments to knock back LS populations in open areas of the range. The midge was able to exert biological control in open areas once the LS populations were reduced by the herbicide.
* Another weed technology is being designed through on-farm research. Common crupina (CC), a fall germinating, annual range weed, was first recorded in the northwestern USA in 1969 [Zamora et al, 1989; Zamora and Thill, 1989]. Its distribution is still limited, and a plan is being designed to eradicate this weed before it becomes a major economic threat. Seedling emergence and seed bank longevity were monitored in farm range areas during a four- year period to understand the biological characteristics of CC necessary to plan its eradication. Farmers on whose land CC is growing are participating in assessing human health risks and potential environmental disruptions from the eradication treatments before the plan is implemented.

9.4 Some issues in planning trial work
Before looking at the possible trial designs, five important points that should be considered when planning trials:
* The Need to Specify Trial Objectives. Clearly defining trial objectives is perhaps the single most important activity in planning a trial. The trial objectives are statements explaining what the trial is supposed to achieve. Decisions regarding the trial design (i.e., the format, that is RMRI, RMFI, or FMFI, the treatments to be included, the data that must be collected, etc.) depend entirely upon the objectives of the trial. For this reason, before starting any trial activity, the researchers and other interested/involved parties must agree on the exact objectives of the trial, and these must be written down, Only after that can the trial be designed and implemented. Beginning a trial without a clear idea of its purpose and exactly what questions need to be answered can result in a lot of wasted effort.
* The Need to Choose an Appropriate Format to Fit Trial Objectives. Once the trial objectives have been defined clearly, the trial design can be formulated. To decide whether a trial should be RMRI, RMFI, or FMFI, researchers will need to consider the type of information required from the trial. If only technical data are required -- such as stand establishment, or grain yield -- the trial probably can be implemented as RMRI. However, if much farmer assessment is required, or if the farmer's own resources need to be involved, then the trial will need to be implemented as either RMFI or FMFI. The choice between RMFI and FMFI will depend largely on the complexity of the trial design, the number of treatments and replications per location, and the type of data required. The more complex the trial and the more technical data are required, the more researcher management will be needed.
* The Need to Limit Research Topics to Fit Research Resources. Researcher-managed trials (i.e., RMRI or RMFI) require a good deal of attention from senior researchers. Aside from being present during critical implementation stages, researchers must make regular field visits to each trial site throughout the season. In addition, much time is required to: plan the trials; collect the necessary inputs; and arrange for tillage, planting, weeding, spraying, and other activities, Trials also require training and supervision of the technicians and often involve a lot of discussions with farmers, Where research teams share resources -- for example, vehicles or technicians that perform work for agronomists, economists, and animal scientists at the same time -- care must also be taken to ensure that individual researchers do not monopolize the resources to the detriment of other disciplines (see Section 6.2),
There are always more problems than researchers have time or resources to address. However, because of all the above requirements for researcher-managed trials, researchers must be very careful in planning their work load for the season. Team members should work together to set research priorities and carefully consider the amount of time and resources that will be required for each planned activity, Taking on too much work will result either in some activities being dropped during the season or some work being lost due to insufficient attention, and the quality of the research generally will be reduced. Taking on less work than is possible will result in a waste of resources, Careful planning and experience will be the best tools for developing optimum work loads.
In contrast to researcher-managed trials, FMFI trials require much less of the researchers' time during the season. Under this format, researchers are involved in planning the trials with the farmers, perhaps in collecting and supplying the necessary external inputs for the trials, and in monitoring the progress of the trials. But this is much less work per trial than is required for day-to-day management of RMFI trials. To reap the full benefit from FMFI trials, it is necessary for researchers and farmers to have frequent discussions, which can be handled efficiently through regular group meetings (see Section 9.8.6). Because farmers are providing the day-to-day management of the trials, researchers can visit the trials at their convenience, rather than having to visit at specific critical periods, This also helps researchers to spread out their work load and improve efficiency,
* Careful Consideration of Experimental versus Non-Experimental Variables. The design stage produces potentially appropriate sets of improved practices for testing at the farm level, The following procedure is recommended for making decisions about the experimental and non-experimental variables in RMRI trials and, when necessary, in RMFI trials that constitute part of the testing stage:
* The experimental variables should consist of practices for which farmers, management is flexible or of new practices that ex ante evaluation suggests would increase productivity. Flexibility in management is increased when there are under-utilized resources? whereas increasing productivity of variables is vital to breaking constraints (Section 6.4.2).
* The feasible range of treatments for such variables is set by the flexibility that exists. For example, some flexibility could be introduced by assuming that the policy/ support system could change. Then, for example, it could be assumed that an institutional source of credit could be made available to supplement the cash flow of the farm business. The above remarks suggest that development of improved practices usually should consider the existing or definitely expected policy/support system. Therefore, results from cause-effect type research will be more relevant if researchers include in the levels of their experimental variables those that farmers might actually be able to implement. If all levels of input required are too high for the farmers to adopt, then the research may have relatively little relevance without the aid of special support programmes for farmers. This applies not only to external inputs like improved seed or fertilizer, but also to internal inputs
such as household labour availability.
* Non-experimental variables should be set at levels representative of local farm practice and/or should be implemented by farmers themselves. The failure to take into account this interaction between farmers' practices and recommendations is a neglected and crucial reason for poor adoption. For example, seed beds are often better in RMRI variety trials undertaken by breeders. Varietal testing under such conditions can provide very different results from what would occur if the seed bed preparation more nearly approximated that generally used by farmers.
* Therefore, it is important to evaluate ex ante whether the levels of the non experimental variables are likely to influence the relationships being examined between the experimental variables, Special justification should be made if the levels of the non-experimental variables differ significantly from what the farmer is likely to be able to achieve, For example, in an RMRI tillage trial, the decision might be made to keep the treatments as weed-free as possible so that they do not complicate an analysis of the differences between the tillage treatments. It is important to recognize, however, that farmers may not be able to create a weed-free environment. Therefore, it may be appropriate to record measurements of the time required in each treatment to keep the plot weed-free. Such information could be useful in later evaluation of the appropriate tillage treatment(s) to use in trials involving farmers. In this connection, such information could be given to farmers to
help in their assessment of which treatments might be appropriate.
* Inclusion of Control Plots. It is important to remember that researchers and farmers need to compare treatments with something. Thus, in all types of trials, some form of control, which 'copies? the farmer's usual levels of the experimental variables, is generally used for comparison. It is amazing how often control plots are omitted (see Box 9.4).
Many farmers might feel confident that they can evaluate new options on the basis of their experience, even when a control or reference is not physically nearby for visual comparison. This is, in fact, the situation with testing new prototype equipment (see Section 10.4.1 ). This approach is generally not advisable for evaluating most cropping and livestock management options. Two problems that can unknowingly arise are:
* Bias in the thinking of the evaluators may not be recognized,
* The evaluators (i.e., the farmers implementing the trial, visiting farmers, and researchers) may not ascertain correctly all the circumstances that surround a particular response,
Both of these can lead readily to evaluations that are better than or worse than what would be the case if controls were included correctly.
To achieve systematic and critical assessments in FSD programmes in the farmer's own design of management strategies, it is strongly advised to conduct test options using controls and a systematic unbiased treatment of each, This latter implies use of randomization, even in the farmer's own testing.
* Plot Design. Because of a number of different constraints, FSD researchers and participating farmers often have adopted the use of field-long and management-friendly plots. These plots are likely to cut across considerable amounts of variability in the field (e.g., soil, hydrology, etc.). In this case, the plot design tactic is to uniformly incorporate field variability into every plot instead of the conventional tactic of carving out portions of land that are homogeneous for making comparisons. Long, management-friendly plots first found their way into on-farm work out of necessity. Using these plots was the only way to interest many farmers and also proved the best way to incorporate farm operations in the trial in a realistic manner. It is now becoming apparent that long management plots also can provide statistical analyses equally as powerful as conventional, small, homogeneous plots (see Box 9.5).
* Careful Attention to Recording Appropriate Data. Although the following discussion concentrates on trial designs, it is important to remember that implementation requires that good records and data are collected either in field books or on specially designed data collection sheets.
This data usually will be largely technically oriented in RMRI and, to a lesser extent, in RMFI trials, There are many methods for collecting such data (i.e., both input and output data) corresponding to the array of enterprises, operations, and subject area concerns, etc., that are found in farming systems around the world. Sometimes data collection procedures that would be appropriate for local FSD work can be found in local extension bulletins or research reports, Training manuals produced by the international agricultural research institutes and by NGOs and training institutions in the country where the FSD team(s) is located also can often be useful, This is because methods often need to be adjusted to fit particular situations and farming systems. For example, FSD teams helped produced guidelines for data collection in Botswana. These are available in Worman et al. 11992: pp. 149-202], Included are procedures for trial site selection, calculations of seeding and
fertilizer rates, soil characterization, and so forth. Two excerpts of the Botswana work, covering measurements of plant density and grain yields, are included as Appendix A3 in this manual, They have been included because they treat the topic of measurements in mixed cropping that generally is not covered elsewhere, while at the same time illustrating the need to make adjustments in the data collection procedure to fit the environment in which the research is being undertaken.
An important component of this data collection -- and, unfortunately, it is something that often is omitted -- is recording of data that describes the environment under which the trial was undertaken, These site descripters include data on soil type, weather (i.e., temperature and rainfall), unusual features, etc., which help in ascertaining the potential for extrapolation to other areas.
However, it is important particularly in RMFI and FMFI trials, that such data be supplemented by socio-economic information. If this is not done, and often it is not done satisfactorily, the trials are really simply technically oriented, multilocational-type trials and the major objective behind involving the farmer -- that is assessment of relevancy under practical farming conditions -- is lost. With reference to socioeconomic type data, attitudinal or more qualitative-type data can be very useful, Because of costs, however, care must be taken in deciding what objective or quantitative types of data need to be collected (see Section 6.5.1 ). Usually such types of data relate to physical data (i.e.' usually technical data already collected); labour and equipment requirements by type and operation; and price data relating to inputs, outputs, and wages [Worman et al, 1992: pp. 187-193, 200-201]. Collection of such date can be particularly time consuming. Therefore,
sometimes it is possible to use standard labour coefficients for some operations that don't change between operations and only collect labour data on operations that are likely to be affected by the operation. In other cases, it is appropriate to collect socio-economic data on only a subset of all trial sites.
* Decision Concerning Evaluation Procedure. In order to ensure an appropriate experimental design and data collection procedure, the evaluation procedure should be decided on before the trial is implemented.
BOX 9.4: FARMERS CAN BE RELUCTANT TO HAVE CONTROL PLOTS
The use of controls or check plots is important to researchers in providing standards against which experimental treatments can be compared. A recent survey of farmers in Kansas, USA, concerning their attitudes about on-farm research [Freyenberger et al, 19941, which incidentally were very positive, indicated that farmers tended not to be very concerned about controls, perhaps because of familiarity with their own farm and the fact that they felt it was necessary only to convince themselves of the value of the results. Only 36% of the farmers implementing their own on-farm research had controls likely to be acceptable to researchers, with those farmers particularly interested in sustainable agriculture practices being the least supportive of this strategy (i.e., only 28%). In fact, 25% of all the farmers and 35% of the 'sustainable agriculture' farmers used only a before- and-after comparison.
The implication of these findings is that compromises will be needed on both sides, if effective, collaborative, working relationships are going to develop between farmers and FSD researchers and if farmers are to be able to provide an effective means for other (i.e., visiting) farmers to compare the proposed change with what is currently done. This latter point is particularly important, because the survey also revealed that farmer-to-farmer communication and interaction were very important sources of information on possible changes.
BOX 9.5 LONG NARROW PLOTS MAKE GOOD PRACTICAL AND STATISTICAL SENSE
Farmers participating in an on-farm research programme in the state of Iowa, USA (i.e., Practical Farmers of lowa, PFI) opted for narrow plots that ran the entire length of the field. Usually, the width of these plots was about two widths of the widest piece of equipment used, Farmers found that using this plot design enabled them to make side-by-side comparisons of a number of treatments and even to randomize treatments much more easily than they could using small 'garden plots, typical of most research work.
These management-friendly plots not only improved the quality of implementation of on-farm trials, they also boosted their statistical power [Thompson and Thompson, 1990], Statistical power, as shown by low percent coefficients of variation (CVs), was found to be actually greater for on-farm trials with long plots that cut across large amounts of field variability than for shorter on-farm plots or for small station-plots.
For measurements on corn, soybean, and wheat yields in a range of experiments, CVs ranged from:
* 0.7-5,9% for plots 6m wide by 365m in length in which the entire plot was planted and harvested by the farmer.
* 4.5-15.2% for 12m by 38m plots managed by researchers but conducted on farms,
* 8-15% for small station-plots that were planted and harvested by hired help,
A related study showed that costs and information returns for farmer managed research was superior to those of station-based research in these subject areas.
This implies that FSD personnel should not conclude that on-farm work, though relevant, is always technically inferior to station managed research,
9.5 Trial designs appropriate to crop research
A number of possible trial designs can be used in FSD work, especially for those relating to crop research. For convenience in presentation, they can be divided into two major groups as follows:
* Those that involve replication of treatments within fields. These are most suitable for RMRI trials, whereas the simpler designs can be used in RMFI trials.
* Those that usually have no replication of treatments within fields. These very simple designs are used in FMFI trials.
The following sections briefly outline the different types of trial designs.
9.5.1 Trial Designs Involving Replication within Fields
Some experiments require accurate comparisons of several quite specific treatments. For example, a tillage trial might involve comparisons of several different tillage options, or a fertilizer trial might involve examining the effects of several different levels of fertilizer application, of both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer. For the comparisons to be meaningful, the treatments must be applied in a particular way and at very specific times on each plot. To be sure of detecting important differences between the treatments, it is usually necessary for this type of trial to be replicated both within a farm and across several farms and often across years as well. Because of the need for precise treatment applications and replications, these types of trials generally require researcher management either RMRI or RMFI. For these types of trials, the use of simple, formal, trial designs is quite appropriate:
* Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The CRD is one of the simplest trial designs. When using the CRD with a field trial, the number of treatments and the number of replications per treatment are decided first. Then the appropriate number of plots are drawn, and the treatments are assigned randomly to all plots. This usually is done with the help of a random number table.
This type of design is appropriate only for experiments where plots cannot be grouped meaningfully. An example would be where all plots are on the same soil type, the soil is of equal depth in all plots, and the field has very little or no slope. The CRD is the simplest design in terms of the analysis of the data, especially if some treatments are lost. Less information is lost with missing data in the CRD than with other designs. The disadvantage of the CRD is that it is not very precise, because all of the variation between experimental units is included in the experimental error term,
* The Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). The RCBD is used where experimental units -- that is, plots in field trials -- can be grouped meaningfully. For example, plots higher up a slope may be grouped together, and plots lower down the slope may be grouped together. Or, if soil depth varies from one end of an experimental area to the other, plots on the end with shallower soil may be grouped together, and plots on the end with deeper soils may be grouped together, These 'groups' generally are referred to as 'blocks', In the RCBD, because each block contains a complete set of treatments, these blocks also can be called replications or 'reps' for short, The reason for grouping the treatments this way is so that differences observed between treatments are more likely to be due to the treatments themselves, rather than the differences between experimental units,
The RCBD is one of the most commonly used designs for field trials. This is because differences exist in most fields, and using 'blocks' helps to improve the precision of the experiment, It is also relatively simple to analyze, so long as one can avoid missing data points. It should be noted, however, that when using the RCBD, the researcher must have some idea of what field differences he or she is blocking against and lay out the trial accordingly.
* Split Plot Designs. A split plot refers to a trial plot that receives a certain treatment and then is 'split' or divided into sub-sections, to which different levels of another treatment are applied. For example, suppose an experiment is designed to examine the effect of irrigation on sorghum grain yields. Three treatments are included: no irrigation, moderate irrigation, and heavy irrigation, Then suppose the researchers also wish to examine the effects of irrigation, with and without nitrogen fertilizer. Each of the irrigation treatment plots is 'split'. One half of each plot receives the nitrogen treatment, and the other half does not. In each replication, then, there will be one non-irrigated plot, one plot that receives moderate irrigation, and one with heavy irrigation. Additionally half of the area that receives no irrigation will receive nitrogen; the other half will not. Half of the plot that receives moderate irrigation will receive the nitrogen treatment, and
the other half will not, Half of the plot that receives heavy irrigation will also receive the nitrogen treatment, and the other half will not. The irrigation treatments have been 'split' for different levels of nitrogen.
Split plot designs are used commonly when:
* Large experimental areas are required for one treatment but not for others (e.g., irrigation treatments on different crop varieties).
* Researchers wish to include an additional factor in an experiment to increase the scope of the experiment (e.g., adding a fertilizer treatment to a trial involving several tillage treatments).
* Larger differences are expected from one factor than the others (e.g., irrigation treatments on different sorghum varieties).
A split plot experiment is often a convenient approach for implementing research that involves the comparison of different levels of two or more factors. However, the designs and the analytic procedures are slightly more complicated than the CRD or RCBD.
In RMRI type trials, any of the above designs can be used satisfactorily in on-farm trials. However, in the case of RMFI trials, it is probably best to restrict trial designs to an RCBD or CRD, to restrict replications to two or a maximum of three per farm, and to restrict treatments to a maximum of four or five. Remember, the more complicated the trial is, the more difficult it will be to obtain 'qualitative' farmer assessment of the different treatments. The idea of seeking farmer assessment as early as possible in the research process, as argued earlier (Section 9,2), can be important to avoid wasting research resources and time on developing technologies that will never be, or are unlikely to be, acceptable to farmers.
9.5.2 Trial Designs Usually Not Replicated within Fields
In these types of trials, replication takes place across fields. The following three types of FMFI trials are used commonly in FSD work:
* Paired Comparisons. Using this approach, farmers implement a planned comparison in their field on previously marked plots. This approach generally is used for simple comparisons, for example, with and without fertilizer, row planting versus broadcast planting, or single ploughing versus double ploughing. However, it also can be used to test an 'improved' system against the farmer's 'traditional' system, for example, a system involving double ploughing, row planting, and phosphate fertilizer versus the traditional broadcast planting, single ploughing, unfertilized system. This format generally requires that the same crop and variety be used for all paired comparisons, with the same seeding rate across trials and farms, and the same planting date for each plot in a pair. Then, aside from treatment variables, the management of the comparison follows the farmer's usual practices.
The number of treatments in each set of comparisons also can be expanded where it is necessary and appropriate. For example, the approach could be used for crop variety trials, where researchers wish to determine the best variety of a crop to recommend within a region. In this case, the comparison might include three or four new varieties, to be compared against the farmer's own.
The paired comparison format has been used extensively in FSD work for FMFI trials. It is appropriate for farmers because:
* It is fairly simple to understand and implement.
* It generally does not require much of the farmer's time or management, because it is a small trial.
* The results are fairly clear and easy for farmers to interpret -- whether or not there has been any benefit from the 'improved' treatment.
The format is also easy for researchers to apply over a large number of fields. Once the sites have been selected and marked prior to the start of the season, farmers can usually implement the treatments themselves, with researchers checking the progress in the regular group meetings and/or visiting the fields at their convenience (Box 9.6).
As indicated, these types of trials usually are best replicated across a number of farms, rather than being replicated within a farm, However, this observation is based on experiences in low-income countries with limited-resource farmers. Limited farmer resources in terms of labour, traction, land, etc., often make it difficult for a farmer to handle more than one replication adequately, especially because plot sizes used tend to be larger than would generally be the case in RMRI trials. Nevertheless in high-income countries replication within a field becomes a more realistic possibility, although as will be seen later (see Section 10,4,3), there are advantages to involving more farmers and testing under as wide a range of environments as possible, Therefore, replication within farms should not be undertaken at the expense of involving more farmers,
* Field Testing New Equipment Prototypes, One of the simplest trial formats can be used when testing new pieces of farm machinery. In this case, the equipment simply is used by several farmers within a region, No plot size is specified, and no replications are required within a farm, The farmers simply are provided with the equipment, shown how to use it, and -- as long as they have an interest -- are requested to put it to use. Researchers then assess the performance and effectiveness of the equipment by:
* Observing its operation in the field.
* Holding informal discussions with the farmers who use it,
* Conducting a formal survey of the farmers who use it.
A formal survey may be used to obtain quantifiable data on farmers' opinions, the problems they encounter in using the equipment, their suggestions for improvements, and their judgments as to whether or not the equipment could benefit their farm operations (Box 9.7),
This approach is particularly suited to testing equipment that has been used in other areas and that researchers wish to introduce into the target area. In such cases, the design of the equipment is known to be effective, and the primary purpose for the tests is to determine whether the equipment is appropriate for farmers' systems and resources and the environment in the target area.
* Superimposed Trials. As indicated earlier (see Section 9.2), superimposed trials can be used to test relatively simple innovations under farmer management. In these trials, a treatment is superimposed in a plot or plots on a farmer's field, often after the farmer has started the initial crop husbandry work, usually after planting. The comparison in this case is generally between the farmers own system and that system plus an additional treatment, for example, an extra weeding or a top dressing of nitrogen, etc. The treatment plot yields are compared with yields from an equal area of the field adjacent to the treatment plot. There may be more than one comparison per field, and comparisons usually are made in a number of fields.
Unlike the other types of trials, discussed earlier, which are implemented according to a plan drawn up at an earlier date, superimposed trials can be pre-planned or unplanned in the sense of responding to a problem that has arisen and for which a satisfactory solution is sought. Examples of the flexibility of superimposed trials are given in Box 9.8 .
BOX 9.6: FARMER GROUPS ARE SUITABLE FOR MONITORING FMFI TRIALS
Farmer groups (see Section 9.8.6) have many good characteristics, one being to provide a forum for making the use of researchers' time more efficient, particularly with reference to FMFI trials that they need to visit only irregularly. In one area of Botswana, when a set of this type of trials was managed through group meetings, farmers about 100 comparisons were properly implemented in both the 198788 and 1988-89 seasons.
BOX 9.7: TESTING EQUIPMENT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT APPROACH
A new type of donkey collar was introduced in one area of Botswana. Originally, it was designed and manufactured in Kenya where it was in general use. It Botswana, it was tested by several farmers. Both informal discussion and survey data showed that it was an improvement over the equipment farmers had been using up to that time. After that study, local production of the collar was started and collars were offered as part of a development extension programme.
BOX 9.8: SUPERIMPOSED TRIALS PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR RESEARCHERS
Two examples from Southern Africa illustrate the flexibility of superimposed trials:
* Pre-Planned. Experiment station trials had determined earlier the ideal plant populations for sorghum and millet. However, in FSD work, it was found that few farmers achieved the ideal plant population, Therefore, the cooperation of a few farmers who already had standing crops was obtained, in order to investigate the practicality of gap filling -- through transplanting -- and thinning, so that farmers could more closely approach the optimum plant population.
* Unplanned. A farmer with a plot infected with many weeds was not keen on investing a lot of labour in weeding. In order to demonstrate the benefits of weeding on the eventual yield of the crop, it was suggested that he weed only part of the plot.
Advantages of superimposed trials include the following:
* Often they can be undertaken at a lower cost than RMRI or RMFI trials.
* A potential exists for responding to research opportunities that arise during the agricultural year.
* They can provide an easy way to demonstrate new practices or technologies to farmers.
Thus, there is considerable potential for superimposed trials to respond to unanticipated opportunities and as tools in convincing farmers to change their strategies.

9.6 Approaches to livestock trials
Animals are complex biological systems involving many elements such as health, nutrition, genetics, reproduction, and behaviour. The multiple uses of animals and the multiple ways they interact with other components of the farming system all make trial work with animals very complicated compared with crop research. Table 9.2 shows some of the differences between crops and livestock that have important implications for research related to livestock. Some of the implications for handling these are given in Table 9.3 together with suggested strategies and techniques for handling them in on-farm testing.
TABLE 9.2: COMPARISON OF CHARACTERISTICS OF CROPS AND ANIMALS
CHARACTERISTICS CROPS ANIMALS
Mobility Stationary Mobile
Live cycle duration Generally less than six months Generally more than one year

Observation unit numbers Many Few
Variability of observations Lower Higher
Source: Amir and Knipscheer [1989: p. 13].
Obviously, in designing and testing research work involving livestock, these characteristics and issues need carefuI consideration. In general, on-farm trial work with livestock has been much more difficult to implement and less successful than that involving crops. Therefore, it is inevitable that greater emphasis tends to be placed on RMRI type trials -- often on experiment stations -- than should be the case in crop research. There is also another important reason for this tendency. These trials involve more of a risk for the farmer than do crop trials, because they affect the limited number of livestock owned by the farming family and such trials generally take place over a longer period of time. To minimize farmer risk, it is most important that basic research affecting a trial be completed on-station before the trial is moved to the farm.

Sorce: Caldwell and Walecka [1987: pp. 257 - 259].
In recent years, there has been increasing concern with evaluating the appropriate roles for station-based and farm-based research with respect to livestock, For example, participants at one conference concluded that [FSSP, 1986: pp. 5-71:
"On-station research should focus on testing higher yielding variants of old enterprises (e.g., from other areas) or testing new enterprises as suggested by ex ante analysis, and by on-farm research. Because this kind of research (introducing new enterprises or improving old ones) has to be more controlled than on-farm research, it should be done on-station before on-farm research, unless the technology is well established and unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that on-station research can be omitted."
The participants also identified five roles for on-farm research with respect to livestock [FSSP, 1986: p. 5]:
* To give an ex ante description of the production systems and to identify relevant problems for on-station research.
* To verify on-station results,
* To provide a continuing flow of information to on-station programmes.
* To test new technologies under farmers' conditions.
* To demonstrate improved technologies to farmers and extension personnel.
Experience supports the greater role of on-station research in the livestock area. Some reasons include:
* Compared to crop trials, more frequent monitoring is required for livestock trials, which increases travel costs for on-farm research.
* Because animals do not care for themselves and do not stay in one place like plants, the results are likely to be less accurate on-farm, compared to the more controlled environment of the station,
* In working with livestock, laboratory facilities may be more important than in working with plants. This is because fewer animals are involved, and the loss of an animal is a major event,
* Laboratory facilities, which are used to conduct research on blood samples and in diagnoses of diseases, are superior at a station, and there are generally fewer problems in transporting specimens to the laboratory from an on-station trial.
The other side of the coin is that, unless extreme care has been taken in the diagnostic phase -especially in areas like animal health, biased data may be used to determine priorities. What is actually a big problem at the village level may never be reported to central research stations, because the farmers don't know its a problem, don't recognize it as a problem, or think it is something else all together, For example, farmers may understand that heart-water kills stock, but don't know it by that name or recognize that ticks transmit it. Thus, it is important, where possible, that professionals in the disease area have some involvement in the diagnostic phase.
Farmer-managed livestock experiments should take place in the farmer-managed setting, with farmer-provided livestock. However, when farmers have very limited livestock resources and each animal is valuable, it may be necessary to reduce the amount of farmer risk in order to encourage participation. If there is any risk to the animals' health, even if it is only minimal, it may be necessary to provide a guarantee of replacement if the animal is incapacitated or dies [Shaner et al, 1982: p. 121].
In addition, if the researchers are going to conduct research either by providing animals to farmers (e.g., a new breed) or through researcher implemented animal trials, it is important to be certain that the farmer or research field staff is capable of handling the animals, They also must be willing to take on the day-to-day responsibility of animal care, particularly in a confined or semi-confined trial situation. In the case of research staff, they must be made aware that animal care is a daily responsibility -- particularly with confined animals -- and that someone must perform the daily chores whether it is a public holiday or not. This may necessitate special administrative arrangements to pay overtime or otherwise compensate staff for the extra time.
9.7 Testing within crop-livestock systems
In low income countries, the vast majority of farmers who keep livestock also grow crops. Therefore, any proposed changes in technologies relating to livestock have to be evaluated in terms of their potential impact on the whole farming system. Thus, testing on-farm can be a very important exercise. Testing of technology alternatives, within the crop-livestock system, may be carried out on a single management component component technology research -- or on a combination of technologies that may involve both crop and animal production techniques. Thus, the objectives of the testing phase include:
* Measuring the performance of alternative technologies in the farm environment.
* Comparing alternative component technologies and production systems with those currently used by farmers in terms of biological productivity, farm resource use efficiencies, and farmers' preference.
* Identifying labour, cash, and agricultural input requirements of alternative technologies.
* Identifying resource conflicts at the farm or community level that may be caused by the alternative technologies.
If a number of major changes are being introduced in an alternative crop-livestock system, the situation is even more complicated. One approach that can be taken in this situation and has been used in the past, is to use a unit farm, where a suitable farmer is selected to 'allow, his/her farm to be modified at the researcher's cost, and the test is run within the farm environment. Because the test is researcher-managed and -implemented, it may and, in tact, generally does, lose its 'farmer character' [Zandstra, 1985: p. 176].
Therefore, as with crops, it is important for farmers to be involved as much as possible in trials involving livestock. Some ways that farmers can be involved in livestock trials are:
* As an observer, where the researcher designs and executes an RMRI trial on the research station or on the farmer's land sometimes with her/his animals, These test animals often are used through a rental agreement, However, as has been argued earlier with respect to crop research (see Section 9,2), there is considerable merit in exposing farmers to such work and eliciting their opinions on the proposed treatments and the results.
* As implementor of a test with the farmer conducting all operations (RMFI) using his/her resources and animals, often augmented by production inputs or implements and with supervision from the researcher, However, experience has indicated that RMFI trials with respect to livestock are generally not very successful, meaning relatively greater emphasis on RMRI type trials, This is because ceteris paribus conditions tend to be much more difficult to maintain with on-farm livestock trials than with those relating to crops (Box 9.9).
* Through the farmer testing the technology at the FMFI level with or without a support system providing the requisites for the technology to be implemented.
BOX 9.9: LIVESTOCK MOBILITY MAKES RMFI TRIALS DIFFICULT
In Botswana, recommendations exist for mineral supplementation of cattle and small ruminants. However, RMFI trials that one FSD team was involved in with respect to mineral supplementation failed to demonstrate convincing results. One of the reasons was undoubtedly the fact that livestock in the harsh environment of Botswana tend to be very mobile and, as a result, do a substantial amount of browsing, which provides a variety of minerals. Browsing was not considered an option when testing the benefits of mineral supplementation in experimentation in on-station RMRI trials.
Therefore perhaps, given the current livestock practices in Botswana, mineral supplementation is not a relevant recommendation, However, the experience also highlights the need to take current farming practices into account when designing proposed improved technologies.

9.8 Implementation of trials with farmer involvement
9.8.1 Regular Farm Visits
It has been said that the best 'fertilizer' a farmer can apply to the crop is foot prints in the field. In other words, regular field visits are extremely important for ensuring a good crop or a productive animal. The same applies to good trials.
Well trained technicians can be very helpful in implementing trials and collecting data, but their performance will be only as good as their supervision. Regular visits are important for several reasons:
* Only through regular visits will researchers understand what has happened in the trial throughout the season and be able to correctly interpret the results,
* Only through these visits can the researchers observe and guide the performance of the technicians and farmers -- in the case of researcher-managed trials -- and be sure that the trials are implemented properly and the data are collected properly.
* For trials with researcher management, it is particularly important that researchers are present when treatments are being applied and critical events occur in the implementation of trials (e.g., when crops from trials are harvested). Mistakes during such activities could greatly affect trial results and lead to either misinformation being produced or the loss of valid results from a trial.
* Lastly, in researcher-managed trials, only through regular field visits can researchers identity problems in a timely manner (e.g., developing weed infestations, developing insect problems, or disease problems in livestock) and deal with them appropriately.
Thus, particularly in researcher-managed trials, there is no substitute for regular visits by senior researchers. Probably visiting once a week is a minimum. Even with FMFI trials, senior researchers must visit each trial occasionally to ensure that the trials are valid for analysis and to understand what has occurred so as to interpret the results correctly.
9.8.2 Interacting with Farmers
Interactions between research and extension personnel and farmers sometimes can be poor because of shyness, a lack of respect, or not knowing how to communicate with the farmers In order to improve the quality of such interaction, it is important for FSD and extension staff to accept the following:
* Researchers should realize that they are there to serve the farmers, not the other way around
* Researchers must understand that the farmers are not there only to do trials and demonstrations. They have other more important objectives, like working to teed their families. Therefore, farmers cannot always give high priority to trials and/or demonstrations. Therefore, it is important to be reasonable about the level of cooperation and collaboration requested of the farmer. For example, efforts should be made to avoid becoming over-committed and putting him/her into a high risk situation.
* Efforts should be made to ensure that both farmers and researchers know exactly what the agreement is. In other words, a type of contract -- which may simply be verbal in nature -- needs to be agreed upon. Also, care should be taken by FSD team members to deliver on any promises of help that they make and to be very wary about building any reward systems into the contract terms. In general, reward or insurance terms, such as guaranteeing a certain level of return, should be avoided, particularly in trials at the FMFI level,
* Sometimes FSD and extension staff feel they must give answers to all questions, whether they are sure of their facts or not. Instead, they should realize that giving wrong information to farmers is much worse than saying 'I don't know', because eventually they will lose the farmer's confidence. In this case, it is best to answer: 'I don't know, but I will find out', Researchers also can check with other farmers to see if they have any good solutions.
* The concept of the trial and the procedures to be used must be explained fully and carefully, several times, especially where farmers are conducting experiments for the first time, because they sometimes have difficulty understanding the concept of 'comparisons,, Any disappointments that result from farmers not collaborating to the degree anticipated should be transmitted to the farmers in a constructive rather than a destructive manner. It is important to try and learn from such experiences and plan in the future, if possible, to make changes that will avoid these happening again,
* Because no technology works in all places, at all times, it is dangerous to tell farmers 'this works', 'this doesn't work,. Instead it is better to say, 'in our experience, this works more often than that', then suggest the farmers try it and form their own opinions,
* It is also important to be well prepared, Farmers lose confidence when they come to a demonstration and the equipment doesn't work, or they are promised seed and it is not delivered. FSD workers should prepare thoroughly, in advance, before meeting farmers and work hard to fulfill their promises.
* It is important to listen to and, where possible, desirable, or relevant, attend to farmers' problems quickly.
Farmers, participation is critically important in FSD. The level and degree of participation of course varies according to the nature of the trial. In RMRI trials, the farmer provides the land and the researcher provides all the inputs and controls the trial. The farmers' contribution is in a sense minimal. On the other hand, in RMFI trials, the farmers' participation is much greater, because they are responsible for implementing the trial under the management of the researcher. Thus, in this type of trial, the quality of the interaction becomes critically important. Finally, in FMFI trials, the farmer is in complete charge and the researcher is dependent on good interaction in order to reap any benefits from the trials.
Although the intensity of interaction with the farmer will depend on the type of trial, a number of factors will influence the nature of the relationship. These are discussed below for each type of trial. Researcher-farmer relations, location of trials on the farm, on-farm trial designs, field data management, and standardization are a few things that need to be considered when conducting research in farmers, fields with their active participation. Although the tone of the following discussion implies emphasis on on-farm trials involving crops, many of the principles apply to on-farm livestock trials as well.
BOX 9.10: RMRI PLOT SIZES ARE DETERMINED BY ENVIRONMENT AND TOPIC
In semi-arid Botswana, the size of RMRI plots has generally been a minimum of 6m by 20m when less precise methods of planting and spreading fertilizer have been among the included treatments. These plot sizes could be smaller if more precise placement methods were used.
For soil moisture conservation/tillage trials using animal draught, plot sizes of 40m to 50m in length and 10m to 15m wide have been satisfactory. Using tractors in such trials might require plots up to 0.5 hectares in size. For these types of trials, large plots are necessary to ensure that treatment effects are separated within the experiment. the researcher's supervision? members of the host family can participate when invited or when they have time and are interested in learning more about the technology. The farmer also can be hired to do some of the work, for example, weeding, bird scaring, or threshing, and may provide the draught power. The farmer is paid for this work, and in most cases, the grain yields are given to the farmer in lieu of rent.
9.8.3 Implementation of RMRI Trials
Relevant points with reference to RMRI trials are as follows:
* Selection of Farmers. In this type of trial, the selection of farmers depends less on their resources -- because these are provided by research -- and more on the technical environment (e.g., are soils representative for the area?), Nevertheless, significant secondary criteria in the selection process are the interest and potential for cooperation individual farmers have shown, Also, they need to possess a large enough area of suitable land to allocate to a replicated trial. Each farmer is approached individually. Researchers meet the farmer before the planting season to discuss the proposed trial and to find out if the farmer is willing to host a trial. The farmer is encouraged to take an interest in the implementation of the trial and, to the extent possible, to comment on and evaluate both the proposed treatments and the results. The more the farmer understands about what is going-on, the more capable he/she will be in explaining it to visitors and friends, so that
more individuals can learn from the trial.
* Site Selection. The site should be representative of the target environment and should include the type of soil, topography, etc. suitable for research work. It is important to make clear to the farmer that such conditions are needed to prevent bias in the results. A trial site should not be located where there are paths, ditches, large trees and other conditions that are not normally part of the environment. To ensure good researcher-farmer relations, it is very important that the site be satisfactory for both the farmer and the researcher. Plot sizes obviously are determined by the content of the trial and usually can be the same as used on-station (Box 9.10).
* Implementation. Farmers must understand the importance of the trial to the researchers. The risk of not completing trials is higher on farms than on experimental stations. All the arrangements and the implementation are carried out by the researcher, but the farmer, as a partner, should be informed of the whole procedure so that he/she will not destroy it through independent action or by accident. Although all the work is carried out by the researcher or under
* Data Collection. Less information usually is recorded in on-farm trials than in trials conducted on experiment stations, Researchers should not collect data beyond what is appropriate for the area and the trial, Farmers develop high expectations when something is done on their farms, and their curiosity should be satisfied as quickly as possible if their support and assistance are to continue, Consequently, it is important to ensure that as little time as possible lapses between the completion of trials (i.e., recording data) and informing the farmer of the results,
* Yield Estimation and Result Assessment. For most trials, the final stage is assessing and evaluating a given technology, with yields from the different plots representing the differences between treatments, A suggested procedure is as follows:
* It is important to inform the farmers that production obtained from the trial will eventually be theirs to keep. One approach is to leave all the grain at the farmer's house for drying, threshing, and weighing. However, sometimes this is not possible if detailed information is required on seed weight, seed number. etc.
* Farmers should be given the opportunity to see the yield differences that occurred between the plots before the grain is combined for storage. This provides them with an opportunity to appreciate the treatment differences attained.
* After harvest estimation is completed, farmers should be thanked for their assistance, and plans for the coming year discussed with them. For example, whether the same trial will be repeated, what modifications will be made, whether the same or a different location should be used, etc.
9.8.4 Implementation of RMFI Trials
Relevant points with reference to RMFI trials are as follows:
* Selection of Farmers. Farmers for these trials are selected in the same way as in RMRI trials, They are contacted individually before the beginning of the planting season. Because in RMFI trials, farmers carry out the work under the guidance of the researcher. it is extremely important that the farmer understands the differences between the treatments, what is being compared, and what is required for the different treatments and appreciates the importance of proper experimental procedures. It is also essential that the farmer has a genuine interest in the trial, so that he/she is serious about properly implementing the procedures. The farmer also must have the necessary resources to conduct the trial. Proper selection of farmers in this case requires a good deal of researcher-farmer discussion. Proper selection of participating farmers can make all the difference between successful and unsuccessful RMFl trials.
* Site Selection. As with RMRI trials, a representative location should be chosen for the trial, so that the results can be generalized. Portions of the field with big trees or stumps, paths, ant hills, and ditches should be avoided. Again, the location must be agreed upon mutually by both parties. Because part of the purpose is to examine the effect of farmer implementation of the technology, farmers must have sufficient space to simulate a real operation. In other words, they must have a sufficiently large plot so that the implementation is not very much different from the way it would be done on the whole field. This enables collection of 'real' socio-economic data relating to labour and traction. Where animal draught is being used, plots need to be long enough so that the animals are not turning around constantly. Also, there must be sufficient space at the end of each plot for the animals to turn without entering other experimental plots. For example in trials where
animal traction is used, a plot length of 40 to 50 metres and a width of 10 to 15 metres may be satisfactory. For crop variety trials where labour or animal traction inputs are not likely to vary substantially between treatments (i.e., except for differences in time required to harvest the different yields), plot sizes can be smaller. Finally, where larger plots are used, the total number of plots must be restricted severely, so that all plots can be planted within a reasonably short period (e.g., a day).
* Implementation. When conducting RMFI trials, the researcher must appreciate that the farmer its not simply someone to be given instructions on what to do. Rather, the work that the farmer is to do must be discussed and agreed upon mutually. Researchers must accommodate the other priorities of the farmer within the experimental design. Thus, although the farmer does all the implementation under the guidance of the researcher, there is a sharing of responsibilities, and the farmer plays a significant role so that he/she can be in a position to assess the potential value of the technology under practical farming conditions.
* Data Collection. The farmer should be informed during the planning of the trial what data will be collected. Before the trial work begins, it is important to decide on how to record the data collected. It is advisable to develop some standard procedures on how to collect the data. These procedures will help to protect the reliability of the information and to speed up the data processing and analysis.
* Yield Estimation and Result Assessment. It is important that the farmer understands the harvest procedures and that he/she is to compare the yields of the different plots. It is usually necessary, every year, to remind the farmers about this before harvest time and to check the procedures during and after harvest. Generally, the farmer will assess the value of the different treatments, not only in terms of yields, but also in terms of the inputs required to obtain those yields. In this type of trial, both farmer assessment and researcher judgement -- based on documented figures -- are used in the final assessment of the different treatments.
BOX 9.11: FARMER GROUPS FACILITATE TESTING A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIONS
FSD teams in Botswana have had extensive experience in using farmer groups for organizing FMFI trials. A wide range of options has been tested in such a format including:
* Tillage/water conservation techniques
* Planting method options
* Crop varieties
* Manure and fertilizer options
* Forage and fodder production options
* Evaluation of implements
* Seed protection options
9.8.5 Implementation of FMFI Trials
FMFI trials can be undertaken very conveniently through farmer groups (see Section 9.8,6). The object is to test a broad range of technologies under a wide range of conditions. As well as helping to determine what types of innovations are most appealing to farmers with a wide range of resource conditions, they provide a good way of estimating the robustness of different technologies under real farm conditions Additionally, FMFI trials provide an opportunity for involving farmers directly in the technology generation and assessment process, Points to note about a suitable procedure are as follows:
* Selection of Farmers. Prior to the onset of the experimental period, research staff may attend a village meeting at which they make a formal report describing the results of the previous year's research, They also describe the plans for farmer group activities for the coming year and invite anyone wishing to participate in the farmer group to attend the first group meeting. At the first group meeting, a wide range of technology options is discussed (Box 9.11). Farmers then are asked to select any technology they wish to test. They also are invited to add to the list any items that have not been mentioned. Those farmers wanting to undertake a trial form the farmer group that meets on a regular basis (e.g., monthly), Local extension staff also are invited to attend these meetings, where progress and problems are discussed,
* Site Selection. Farmers themselves choose the sites for their trials, However, they are asked to select sites for the test and control plots that are as similar as possible. Factors to consider in determining plot size are the same as discussed for RMFI trials (see Section 9.8.4).
* Implementation. Trial procedures are discussed at the first group meetings and are repeated in later meetings. Additionally, where necessary, village staff visit farmers to assist in the implementation. Items that are to be tested are supplied to the individuals in the groups. Any equipment being tested is given out on a loan basis. After selecting the technologies they would like to test, farmers cut pegs for marking the plots. FSD field staff visit each farmer to help in pegging each trial and to make sure that the farmers understand what they are supposed to do in terms of implementing each trial. Staff may help supervise implementation, particularly in the case of unfamiliar equipment. Field days often are held in each village, At these field clays, a selection of the participating farmers is given the opportunity to explain and show their trials to the rest of the group, as well as to farmers from outside the group, to FSD staff, to station-based researchers, and to
extension staff,
* Data Collection. Because of the FMFI format of the trials, emphasis is given to obtaining farmer opinions rather than on gathering quantitative data, The farmers assess the technologies and discuss them during the regular meetings As a result, the farmers provide feedback on problems raised and, where possible, help find alternative solutions to them. Further development of PRA techniques (see Section 8.4.4) should increasingly enable a degree of quantification of this qualitative type data.
* Yield Estimation and Result Assessment. At the end of the season, the farmers harvest the plots separately to compare the yields and are helped by the field staff to weigh the produce. As in other types of trials, the farmers are allowed to keep any production from the testing work they conduct, Implements are assessed through informal discussions and by conducting a forma] end-of-season survey, through which farmers express their views on the particular item they have tested, All other trials are assessed by yield comparisons, informal discussions, and formal end-of-season surveys,
9.8.6 Farmer Groups
Because FSD teams in Botswana had a major role in developing the approach for using farmer groups in on-farm experimentation, which is summarised in a recent paper by Heinrich [1993], some time is spent here discussing its characteristics, The term 'farmer group' obviously can refer to any group of farmers who come together for any purpose, However, in the context of on-farm research in Botswana, the term farmer group has been used to signify a group of farmers who come together to test and adapt new agricultural technology options, to discuss the results of those tests, and to identify on-farm needs for other technology options, These groups are composed of farmer participants, researchers, and local extension personnel and generally meet at regular intervals throughout the cropping season. The farmers in these groups select the technologies they are interested in and test them on an individual basis under the FMFI format. They constitute a group in the sense that they meet
to discuss together on a regular basis. These group meetings are supplemented with targeted problem identification/verification visits to specific fields by the researchers themselves during the trial implementation stage.
There are three main purposes for the formation of farmer groups in on-farm research:
* To Expand the Range of Technologies That Can Be Examined in an' On - farm Research Programme. Trials that involve researcher management and supervision require the researchers to spend a good deal of time on field visits. This limits the number of technologies that a research programme can test and evaluate. However, many technology options that may be useful to farmers and others have been developed on the research station and will need field testing before being released to extension. As indicated earlier (see Section 9.5.2 and Box 9.6), by using farmer groups and including farmers in the testing process, research programmes can greatly expand the number of technology options being evaluated in the target area.
* To Include Farmers in the Technology Development Process. One of the main reasons for conducting on-farm research is to include farmers in the technology development process. However, simply having researchers conducting trials on farmers' fields is not the most effective way to undertake this. In the farmer groups, the participants select the types of technologies they wish to test, they perform the tests for themselves, and they discuss and evaluate the various technology options with other farmers as well as with researchers and extension personnel. The two most important criteria used in judging new technology options are: how the technology performs under farmer management and the farmers' joint evaluation of the various technology options. Additionally, at the regular meetings, farmers have the opportunity to present their observations and opinions to research and extension personnel. Thus, through the farmer groups, the farmers become full partners in the
technology development process.
* To Create o Forum for Direct Interaction Between Farmers. Researchers and Development/Extension Personnel. One of the primary objectives of FSD is to create linkages between research, development/extension, and farmers at the field level. Farmer groups bring together farmers, researchers, and extension personnel at the field level, in order to work together to develop applied technologies to increase farm productivity.
There are several ways for farmer groups to be organized. There are research-oriented and extension-oriented farmer groups [Norman et al, 1988]. Although discussion here is confined mainly to research-oriented farmer groups, many of the points apply to extension-oriented farmer groups as well.
The groups are composed of FSD researchers, extension personnel (i.e., from village, district, and regional levels), and farmers, The groups are open to any village farmer who is interested in participating, At the first meeting of the group, researchers (i.e., both station-based and on - farm) discuss a wide range of technology options, addressing as many production constraints as possible, Farmers also are requested to raise questions about problems that they feel have not been addressed adequately. From the list of technology options that is thus developed, individual farmers select specific technology options they wish to test, However, across farms, trials of specific technology options are conducted according to a mutually agreed upon trial design. For example, it is suggested, a cowpea variety trial, if selected for testing by 10 farmers, is implemented using the same set of varieties, on the same size plots, and with the same seeding rate at all ten locations. This
may allow some subsequent statistical analysis, However, if some farmers choose to deviate from that agreed plan, then that is of course, their prerogative. New equipment, small amounts of seed, and required chemical inputs are, if necessary, provided by researchers. Additionally, the researchers visit each trial once during the season to verify proper implementation, Throughout the season, the farmers, researchers, and extension agents meet as a group on a monthly basis. At these meetings, farmers discuss their progress with the trials, their observations, and any problems encountered, Possible solutions to the problems are discussed by the group.
Researchers collect data on the dates of field operations and the crop and variety used -known because of the standard trial design and the use of researcher-provided seed. The type of equipment used also is also recorded. At the end of the season, farmers harvest and sometimes research staff weigh grain yields and conduct end-of-season farmer assessment interviews. PRA interview techniques (Section 8.4.4) also could be used. These interviews are used to quantify farmer's opinions and perceptions of specific technology options (e.g., crop genotypes). Results are reported both to farmers and to other interested researchers.
Many benefits are derived from using the farmer group approach. A few of the more Important ones are as follows:
* Efficiency. Contacting farmers one by one requires a lot of travelling by researchers. Also, when dealing with individual farmers, researchers must explain their work and objectives and the technology options they are interested in testing many times over. By addressing farmers as a group, researchers not only save a great deal of travel time, but they can explain their programme to many farmers at once, thus saving time on explanations as well. By holding regular group meetings with participating farmers throughout the season, farmers, researchers, and development/extension personnel can discuss progress, problems, and farmers' observations, without the researchers having to visit each farm every month. Thus by working with groups, instead of making a lot of visits to individual farmers, researchers save both time and money that would otherwise be spent on fuel.
* Expanded Range of Technologies Tested. When using the farmer group approach, researchers can work with many more farmers than when they work only with individuals. As a result of greater participation in the testing activities, many and varying technology options can be tested.
* Research-Extension Liaison. When researchers talk with one set of farmers and development/extension personnel talk with a another set of farmers' they may form different ideas about farmers' problems in a region and the best solutions for those problems. However, if research and extension personnel work together at the field level and meet together with large groups of farmers on a regular basis, this problem is reduced. Working together in the farmer group approach allows research, extension, and farmers to come to a common understanding of the problems. If the same groups work together to test various technologies that address those problems, then all are able to see which technologies are useful and practical and which are not. Furthermore, if extension personnel participate in technology development, they will be in a good position to later extend the same technologies to other farmers. Thus, the farmer group approach provides a forum where researchers, extension
personnel, and farmers can meet on a regular basis to address problems in the field. This interaction can be of benefit to all participants.
* Group Dynamics and Immediate Feedback. An individual farmer may be reluctant to tell a researcher that a particular technology option is not good. It also may be difficult for an individual farmer to convince a researcher. However, if a group of farmers gets together before a meeting and share a common opinion of a new technology, then it is likely that someone will raise the point during the meeting. Furthermore, if one farmer tells a researcher that a particular technology is not working, the researcher may just assume that the farmer applied the technology incorrectly. This will not happen if 1() farmers at once explain that a technology option is not working. Thus, dealing with people in a group tends to help communications -- if the group is not too large -- and allows research and extension personnel to quickly obtain a practical assessment of any technology being tested. The groups also provide an opportunity for farmers to share opinions and observations among
themselves and to develop their own solutions to problems. In societies that are not egalitarian, farmer groups probably will have to be formed for different 'classes' of people in the village, including, when necessary, different groups for men and women (Box 9.12). Also, as the group becomes bigger, productive interaction may be diminished. It is not clear at what size of group a breakdown in communication is likely to occur but, once this is known, the solution is easy -- break the group into two.
* Farmers Develop Their Own Production Packages. Farmers understand their own production problems and resource constraints better than researchers. Thus, when farmers are able to select technology options from a range of options and apply them where they wish, they often develop specific packages that are more practical than what researchers alone could have devised. Farmers also may find uses for technology items that researchers would not have considered. Thus, farmers can have a lot of input into developing improved production systems.
* Farmers Teaching Farmers. The farmer group approach provides good material for field days. Because the trials are FMFI, the farmer who has implemented a trial is able to present it and explain it to other farmers, Farmers learn best from other farmers, so these field days can be very effective when a technology option is ready for extension.
* Flexible Response to On-Station Research Needs. When large numbers of farmers are participating in the testing activities, it is very easy to introduce new technologies for field testing. For example, if the station-based cowpea scientists wish to get farmer evaluations of five new cowpea varieties, it is easy to introduce these to the groups and find farmers who want to try them. It would not be as easy if the researchers had to implement the tests themselves in several locations, Thus, the farmer group approach makes it easier for on-farm researchers to respond to the needs of on-station research programmes for field testing of their new technologies.
* Forum for Obtaining Other Information. These groups are effective forums for obtaining general information not only on the relevance and value of technologies being offered to farmers, but also on many other topics such as producer prices for products in an environment where there are no physical markets or market days; on aspects that affect all farmers (e.g., comments on development projects, extension, etc.); controversial issues (e.g., availability of inputs); trends (e.g., fertility, draught type, etc.): general opinions on issues; or information on variability (e.g., types of farms, farming systems, planting patterns).
BOX 9.12: FARMER GROUPS FACILITATE INTERACTION
Two very positive experiences have come from using farmer groups in Botswana:
* Members of groups have been together for some time, and, therefore, interactions between the farmers themselves and between the farmers and the 'outsiders' have become more relaxed, creating the potential for more productive discussions.
* The cultural setting is such that discussion is not inhibited between farmers in different recommendation domains, thus creating potential for greater variability in the views expressed. Also, the majority of the individuals attending the meetings have been women, some of whom came from male-headed households .
9.8.7 A Case Study: Evolution of Farmer Groups in the Lake Zone, Tanzania
This case study is based on the experiences of Roeleveld and Colleagues 11994] in the Lake Zone FSD team in Tanzania where, like many other countries, it is still called FSR. The material presented provides a good illustration of how farmer groups can evolve over time and develop a 'life of their own' and incorporate other functions as a result of the feeling of empowerment that members appear to develop. Undoubtedly, internal group dynamics can facilitate this feeling of empowerment.
Following a participatory informal survey conducted in November 1992 by the Lake Zone FSD team, an on-farm research programme was started and resulted in the development of farmer research groups (FRGs). The survey, which was carried out in collaboration with the extension service, focused on animal husbandry, a subject not covered adequately in an earlier survey. During the survey, three villages located in one of the three agroecological zones of Kwimba District (8000 square kilometres) were visited, each one for three days. Techniques such as transect walks, village mapping, kraal visits, and individual and group discussions were used. Male and female farmers from various socio-economic strata of the village communities participated. Within a month after the survey, village debriefing meetings took place to discuss survey findings and to identify an initial research topic. In the meetings, which were very well attended by both male and female farmers, proposals for
research were selected. In all three villages, it was jointly decided that farmers would test an oxen-drawn weeder to alleviate the workload of men, and particularly of women, during the weeding season. A few weeks later, the first trial had started.
More farmers volunteered than could participate, because the number of weeders available were limited. Therefore, some selection was necessary. About 20 households per village could be included. Care was taken to include female-headed and non-oxen-owning households. Participants of this FMFI trial agreed to meet every two to four weeks to exchange experiences in the use of the weeder. The farmers liked this idea and decided that the 'group' should have a chairman and a secretary. This was, in fact, the start of the FRGs or in Swahili kikundi wa wakulima watafiti.
The village extension worker and research staff attended most of the meetings, which were organized regularly by the FRGs in two of the three villages. Attendance was high (i.e., 15 to 30 persons) with a surprisingly large number of women. Farmers were very positive about these exchanges, and discussion on subjects other than weeding quickly developed. Farmers who had not participated in the trial also started attending these one to three-hour meetings. In the third village, the development of the FRG initially stagnated because of village leadership problems, Once the villagers themselves had solved the problems, the FRG in this village also rapidly developed.
About two months after the start of the trials researchers suggested that the FRGs each organize field days to show farmers and extension workers from neighbouring villages, representatives of other FRGs, district extension personnel, and researchers the progress that had been made in ox-weeding. The results more than fulfilled expectations, The FRGs, in collaboration with their local extension workers, organized three extraordinary field days, which included talks by FRG members, field visits, and general discussions, and ended with songs and food, Transport of district staff and a few crates of soft drinks were the only contributions from the research side,
In that same season, FRG representatives visited farmers in a nearby district where ox-weeding had been introduced recently, Also, a male and a female farmer presented their experiences in a one-day workshop for extension and development staff at the district agricultural office, and all three villages participated in a presentation of the oxen-drawn weeder at the annual district agricultural show.
The first season of the ox-weeder testing ended in each village with an evaluation of the technology by male and female farmers (i.e., farmers' assessment). During these meetings, improvements in the design of next season's testing were discussed, and the meetings ended in big social gatherings with dance, music, and food. At the end of the first year, a second trial, feed supplementation of oxen, was implemented and a fourth research village added.
The second season started with village research planning meetings. Most of the participants had participated in the trials of the previous season. More trials, both agronomic and animal production related, were planned, Most experiments had been suggested by researchers but were based on problems identified during the surveys or expressed during FRG meetings. As a result of requests from female farmers, trials on sweet potato and cowpea varieties (i.e., 'women crops') were included, which mostly involved women, Despite suggestions from researchers to consider changes in the organization of the FRGs, because of the growing number of trials and participants, no changes occurred.
As a result of the increase in the research programme on the research side, little attention was paid to further development of the FRG approach during the second season. This was despite concerns regarding the 'openness' of the groups; little involvement of farmers in data collection; and some inefficiencies in the collaboration between researchers, extension workers, and FRG leaders and participants.
Despite this lack of 'active' guidance of the FRGs, they functioned well. FRG meetings continued, field days were organized for large groups of visitors, a village drama was performed during the annual agricultural show, and every trial was evaluated with farmers. Both extension staff and farmers (i.e., from the FRGs and from non-research villages) helped in testing the first extension leaflets.
Attendance at the different events was generally high. Activities for women often attracted 50 to almost a 100 persons. During the second year, the groups developed greater confidence and knowledge concerning the research done and appreciation of the actual role of 'research'. This was expressed very clearly during the many visits FRGs received from missions visiting the research station and from government officials. The FRGs organized the visitors' programme, and both men and women responded to almost all questions raised about the research undertaken.
The second year showed a number of interesting spin-offs. Four of them were as follows:
* An active women's group was established in one of the villages. Although its members individually participated in the trials, they participated as a group in the ox- weeder trial to generate income by cultivating a rented field. The group recently has applied for credit to increase their economic activities.
* Another activity undertaken by tanners, independently from the research programme, was the training of farmers in nearby villages in the use of oxen-drawn weeders. This training occurred following formal requests from neighbouring villages whose farmers had seen the trials on field days, had seen the equipment operating when passing by, or had heard about it from others. Both male and female farmers have visited the villages to help in the training, indicating that both male and female farmers were trained. Attendance at training was reported to be very high.
* As a result of a request for training in the use of oxen-drawn weeders, from a regional Integrated Pest Management Project, 40 subject matter specialists, extension workers, and farmers from three districts were trained during a two-day period by one of the FRGs.
* Finally, two of the FRGs have created a revolving fund that they want to use for income-generating activities such as the supply of inputs.
Currently, the FRGs are at the start of their third season. Attempts have been made by research to organize large, dynamic, research-planning meetings in the villages in order to enlarge the number of participants and to increase participation of different user groups. With this in mind, 'technology markets' were organized in which researchers demonstrated through posters materials, demonstrations etc. what they can offer, and farmers could choose to participate in one or more of the trials. Furthermore, FRGs have agreed on the delegation of tasks and responsibilities by appointing a farmer research coordinator for each type of trial. Participating farmers will also start collecting some experimental data, a task that will be monitored by the village extension workers. Training sessions are being organized to establish this new initiative with reference to the FRGs and research/extension collaboration at the village level.
In conclusion, a promising start has been made in developing a participatory on-farm research programme. Farmers are becoming increasingly involved in the different steps of the research process, Participation in most of the activities and events is generally high, and participants are becoming more self-confident and increasingly familiar with the 'why and how' of the trials. The FRGs have started developing activities of their own, particularly in the field of training and income generation.
Important components in the success of the FRG approach to date are believed to include the facts that the trials address major farmer-felt problems and that farmers are treated as real partners in the research process. The group approach fits well in the Sukuma culture. From the research side, emphasis currently is being placed on finding ways to ensure broad socioeconomic participation and on increasing the efficiency of the research process through better distribution of tasks among the partners, Also, increasing attention will be paid to medium-term research activities, while at the same time increasing the influence of farmers in defining the research agenda.

10. Analysis and evaluation
10.1 Objectives
The objectives of this final chapter are to
* Discuss the types of analyses required in on-farm trials: technical, economic, and social.
* Review some of the characteristics of limited-resource families (i.e., households) and suggest what are likely to be suitable technology evaluation criteria for them.
* Describe some specific techniques for evaluating technologies with respect to technical feasibility, economic viability, and social acceptability.
* Discuss briefly some issues with respect to formulating recommendations, give an example of a specific technology in Botswana, and indicate one way to assess technology adoption.
10.2 Trial analysis: integrated analysis
Analysis of trials is the process by which team members evaluate and interpret trial results to determine the acceptability of a technology to farmers. Through the use of various analytical techniques, trial results are examined and evaluated systematically and used to predict whether farmers will find the technology acceptable, Of course, it is also important to try and ensure that this technology is potentially equitable in terms of its impact in the sense that its adoption by some families does not result in unfavourable impacts on the livelihood of other families in the:
* Short run -- for example, making it impossible for draught to be shared by different families.
* Long-run -- for example, resulting in ecological degradation.
In the long-run, only farmers, not plants or animals, adapt and adopt new technologies, Thus, FSD workers must learn to plan, view. and evaluate their work from the farmers' perspective -- to see the world through the farmers' eyes.
Analysis and interpretation take place after a trial is completed, but the planning for analysis must occur before the trial is implemented if maximum use is to be made of information obtained in the trial. The type of analysis planned is determined by the type of trial, but the implementation of the trial is also dependent on the type of analysis to be conducted.
The objective of analysis is to provide information for an integrated interpretation of trials, which can be used in planning further FSD, identifying relevant on-station research, and/or formulating recommendations for technologies prior to dissemination.
Analysis in FSD is performed on the data generated by on-farm trials, surveys, and studies. Once the data are collected and organized, the team can apply tools from different disciplines to generate a set of disciplinary analyses, which can be considered together in an interdisciplinary framework for final analysis and interpretation (i.e., integrated analysis),
Biological analysis of trials is usually the first step in analysing the actual trial data. At this step, the team determines if the new technology represents a significant biological improvement over the traditional system, The team must decide whether the results were obtained in a 'typical, environmental setting, and so are generally applicable, or whether they were produced under 'atypical' conditions (i.e., don't reflect farmer conditions) and must be interpreted with caution.
Of course, biological evaluation by itself is an inadequate indicator of whether the technology is suitable for dissemination to farmers. As a starting point for analysis, FSD workers seek to understand the household and farming environment. An understanding of the household and farming situation is important, because it serves as a basis for judging whether a technical change represents an improvement, To assess this, three types of analysis are important,
* Technological analysis is performed by the agronomist or animal scientist from the FSD team and determines if the new technology is practical in a technical sense. For example, can the farmer receive a greater yield or more animal product with the inputs and practices he/she can reasonably be expected to use with respect to the new technology?
* Economic analysis is used to determine if the farmer will receive a greater economic and more stable return from adopting the technology, Part of the economic evaluation is an assessment as to whether the farmer has enough resources available to adopt the technology or can acquire them by borrowing or receiving a government subsidy to facilitate adoption,
* Social analysis is used to determine if the technology is acceptable within the household (i.e., intra-household) and overall village (i.e., inter-household) situation. Socio/cultural analysis looks at the technology in a whole farm, analyzes acceptability for the various members of the household who are involved with the technology, determines if there are cultural factors that influence acceptability, examines consumption/nutrition implications, etc.
Another consideration in the social evaluation is an environmental impact assessment (i.e., whether there are likely to be long-term beneficial or harmful effects to using a new technology). Unfortunately, to date, much FSD work does not explicitly undertake an analysis of the environmental impacts of a technology. Researchers may do this subjectively, but it is important to do it explicitly. The whole area of long-term impacts of a technology on the environment is of interest to society and also possibly to the individual farmer. For example, the effect of a cropping system on the long-term fertility of the farmer's land, its impact in increasing or decreasing soil erosion, etc., are areas that deserve more consideration than currently they usually are given.
It is extremely important to all these types of analysis to evaluate whether a technology should be disseminated or not. For example, although biological interpretation may be made on the basis of a statistical test using a ().01 or 0.05 significance level, economic analysis may still be justified for some technologies that do not meet this level of biological significance. Two possible reasons for this include:
* Farmers may be willing to use a new technology, even when biological research results are not statistically significant. This is particularly true when the farmer's investment is small and the potential results are relatively large.
* Even though the level of biological return (i.e., yield) may not be significantly greater for a new technology, there may be other benefits. such as reduced labour demand at certain times, greater reliability in return, etc., that make the technology attractive to farmers.
All of the analyses should include and be tempered by farmers' reactions to the trial and researcher observations. The greater the degree of farmer management in a trial, the less quantitative scientific analysis is likely to be possible and the more qualitative farmer and researcher analysis will be involved. There is a continuum starting with RMRI trials, which have a Iarge amount of quantitative data for scientific analysis, and ending with an adoption study to determine farmer acceptance after the farmers have had a chance to adopt the technology on their own.
The final step is to bring all of the individual analyses together into an integrated interpretation of the trial results, The integrated interpretation of trial results probably should involve farmers and farm family members, FSD and on-station researchers, development/extension staff, and policy makers. Although it may not be possible to get all together in one group to discuss the interpretation of results, all have an interest in this interpretation and should be included at some point. Because different participants have different views of the benefits and costs from adopting a technology, there may not be a single all-inclusive interpretation of the results. An attempt to make an integrated interpretation, however limited, is of value to the FSD team in designing its future work plans, as well as giving the team members guidance in the question of likely adoption of the technology.
Numerous analytical tools are available to undertake the types of analysis just mentioned. The choice of tools depends on the purpose of the trial; the type of trial (RMRI, RMFI or FMFI); the data that have been collected, and the level of training of the researcher carrying out the analysis. Although many sophisticated analysis procedures are available to the researcher? they often have limitations concerning data or implementation of the procedure, which cannot be met under FSD conditions, and so are inapplicable.
The usual approach in practical FSD work is to use fairly simple procedures that are more adapted to field conditions and provide the basic information needed for interpreting trial results. Table 10.1 provides a listing of the primary tools that usually are used in the analysis process. Emphasis is on simple procedures that can be used under practical field conditions.
Even though FSD teams make use of all these types of analysis, they primarily rely on a two-pronged approach involving:
* Formal or Quantifiable (More Objective) Evaluation -- especially with reference to technical and economic aspects -- in order to provide convincing evidence to other researchers and planners, extension/development agency staff, and those responsible for formulating recommendations.
* Informal or Qualitative (Possibly More Subjective) Evaluation on the part of farmers testing it -- which could be based on a large number of criteria are weighted differently,
The following sections, do not discuss some of the standard statistical techniques listed in Table 10.1 that are used in station-based trial work (e.g., t-tests, analysis of variance, etc.) and survey work (e.g., frequency distributions, cross tabulations, chi-square tests, etc.), because they are well covered in standard statistical texts.
10.3 Suitable evaluation criteria -- farmer viewpoint
The ultimate success of a new farming technology depends on farmer evaluation, acceptance, adoption, and sustained use. Much of the success of the evaluation process hinges on selecting appropriate evaluation criteria. The difficulty of separating out these criteria is why FSD teams are increasingly advocating the two-pronged approach mentioned above (see Section 10.2), namely both formal (i.e., quantitative) and somewhat more informal (i.e., qualitative) approaches.

a. Descriptive statistics are common to several types of analysis for use in summarizing and describing data. The tools include: frequency distributions; measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode); measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range, coefficient of variation); and graphics (histograms, bar charts, pie charts).
The primary issue is to ensure that effective evaluation takes place before technologies are recommended for dissemination by the extension service. Obviously, the best test of the value of a technology is the degree of farmer adoption that occurs. Unfortunately, such ex post monitoring is too late to prevent wasted investment in extension training and in policy/support system services developed to handle anticipated increases in production. Therefore, FSD teams try to evaluate the value of the technology ex ante or before it is disseminated widely to the mass of small farmers. A favourable assessment is essential if an official recommendation is to be developed, As implied to some extent in earlier discussion, there are three important points in determining the success of this ex ante evaluation.
* To the extent possible, the criteria used should be those that will be used by farmers in the target group (i.e., recommendation domain). As implied above, these are often difficult to identify.
* Farmer assessment is potentially an important complement to formal quantitative analysis.
* The balance between an evaluation based on the criteria used by local farmers and a societal evaluation -- such as unfavourable impacts on other families and on ecological stability -- is a difficult one to strike.
To help evaluate a technology from the farmer's point of view, some questions that might be useful to ask are:
* Is the problem to be solved important to the farmer? A problem may appear to be important from the researcher's perspective, but not from the farmer's.
* Do farmers understand the trials? Technologies building on small changes in the existing system probably are most easily understood.
* Do farmers have the time, inputs, and labour required for the improved technology? Farmers evaluate the resource requirements of a new technology not only in terms of whether they have or can secure the necessary resources, but also in terms of the competing demands for the resources. In addition, different family members control different resources and so may view the technology differently.
* Does the proposed technology make sense within the present farming system? A change in one part of the farming system generally causes changes in other parts of the system. How will these secondary changes impact the system as a whole?
* Is the mood in the region favourable for investing in new crop/livestock technologies? This may depend on how farmers view the economic and social situation in general. Is the proposed change compatible with the policy/support system that is likely to be available and with local preferences, beliefs, or community sanctions? Tastes and colour in foods, superstitions, the relation of the farming system to larger community values and activities all can effect the acceptance of a new technology.
* Do farmers believe the technology will continue to pay off in the long-term?
In a more formal sense, as was mentioned earlier (see Section 3.4), it is reasonable to assume that farmers will use criteria of two types in evaluating technologies:
* Whether they are able to adopt. Three factors important in determining this are:
* Is it technically feasible for the farmers to adopt the technology, that is, are the necessary inputs readily available and can all the necessary operations be undertaken technically'?
* Is the technology likely to be economically viable (i.e., profitable and dependable) for the farmers to adopt at the levels that will be beneficial to them? In this connection, it is important to be .sure that the proposed technology is more profitable and, hopefully, more dependable than the one it is designed to replace. In comparing technologies, it is important to determine that the proposed improvement increases the return to the most limiting factor. In a situation where labour or draught power are more limiting than land, it is important to look at the relative returns and dependability of those returns, in terms of the return per hour of labour or draught used during the most constraining period (e.g., the ploughing/planting bottleneck in assessing economic viability.
* Is the technology likely to be socially acceptable to the farming families? For some farming families who, for example share draught power, any proposed improved technologies that require more intensive use of draught power may not be acceptable because the potential for sharing may be decreased. As discussed above, there is also an issue of what happens to within household relationships.
* Whether they are willing to adopt. Broadly speaking, will farmers be better able to achieve their goals by using the improved technology'? As indicated earlier, the criteria on which they will decide their willingness to adopt often are difficult to determine. In addition to their experience in testing it and general feeling as to whether it helps in solving problems/constraints Important to them, other factors will include the balance between preferred foodstuffs and returns to labour during one particular period of the season. Such factors are particularly difficult to relate to for those who are 'conditioned' to an experimental method that deals basically in weight per unit area of land. Indeed, several such criteria may have to be brought to bear on a single proposed change. For example, staggered planting as a practice may indicate water, labour, or draught power scarcity, risk management, and a preference for a prolonged supply of a certain type of fresh food --
all at the same time. There is little chance of weighing these correctly in an economic analysis under the conditions in which many limited-resource farmers operate.
This difficulty in second guessing the balance in farmer evaluation criteria often has prompted FSD practitioners to argue for farmer assessment as a practical approach to technology evaluation. The FSD phase of technology development is in farmers' fields, with farmers on the spot. Yet, to date, the devices developed and used for farmer assessment are rudimentary, although, as discussed earlier (see Section 8.4.4), the use of some of the PRA techniques appears to have considerable potential. Farmer assessment is likely to be particularly useful when:
* Farmers have had little previous experience with the components of the new technology and, therefore, cannot be expected to provide useful information in an ex ante survey.
* Knowledge of a recommended technology is needed to focus the questions regarding farmers' experience, because there are many solutions to farmers' problems.
* The farming system is difficult to simulate in a formal model.
* Ex ante survey work has not been well conducted.
Improved methods for routine farmer assessment of technologies continue to need further development and refinement, Farmer assessment has been important in FSD work. Some FSD teams have made efforts to ensure that this took place through:
* Undertaking different types of trials reflecting various degrees of commitment on the part of farmers (see Section 9.2).
* Using farmer groups in assessing the values of the different types of technologies including work done at the RMRI level (see Section 9,8,6),
This emphasis on individual farmer's criteria for technology evaluation ignores the possible impact on other farmers and on broader societal issues, which is considered in a later section (see Section 10.6).

10.4 Technical feasibility
10.4.1 Assessing New Equipment Prototypes
Quantitative and qualitative techniques are used to evaluate technical handling and other aspects of equipment alternatives. Typically, open-ended qualitative survey techniques are used to evaluate how well the equipment handles, to identify issues, and to discover thoughts about changes that might be made. In some cases, these assessments are combined with physical measurements (e.g., efficiency of work indicators such as dynometer readings of pulling power and work rates for a draft animal harness, or precision of work indicators such as seed placement or seed damage rates for a planter) to complete this technical evaluation,
During assessment of the operational handling aspect of alternative equipment, strategies, etc., varied reasons for poor operational handling will be encountered, such as:
* Poor quality manufacturing,
* Inappropriate designs of prototype equipment,
* Lack of training in using unfamiliar equipment and strategies, and so forth,
When handling problems can be foreseen clearly by FSD staff or farmer participants, it is usually advisable to make corrections or necessary adjustments before undertaking statistical testing. Assessments of operational handling may not always require a control for comparison, Controls would not be very meaningful if the experimental operation was qualitatively different from other conventional operations in the farming system.
Informal one-on-one exchanges or group discussions involving farmer participants, FSD staff, and relevant experts are highly effective and informative methods of assessing the handling characteristics of alternative practices. PRA techniques, such as matrix scoring (see Section 8.4.4), potentially are ideally suited to quantify these informal assessments.
Even when the initial assessments of handling performance are negative, significant progress still can be made if insights and suggestions lead to better designs and pinpoint needs for instruction and farmer training.
10.4.2 Assessing the Technical Responses of Alternative Technology Options
Standard statistical techniques listed in Table 10,1, as indicated earlier (see Section 10,2), are the same as those used in station-based trial work (e.g., t-tests, analysis of variance, etc.) and are well covered in standard statistical texts, Therefore, this section simply covers some of the issues involved in choosing which statistical procedures to use in on-farm research analysis,
A number of helpful observations and suggestions have been made by various authors about quantitative evaluation techniques that pertain to FSD in particular, though no single set of standards has emerged yet, The following represent some of these observations:
* FSD generally will not involve itself in a technology fishing expedition. Statistically speaking, this means that FSD technical assessments will place much greater emphasis on estimating levels of technical responses as opposed to testing hypotheses of significant difference.
* The technical merits of technology tested in FSD should have been identified already during the ex ante screening of technology options (see Section 5,8.2). The relevance of estimating the magnitude of a difference as opposed to its statistical significance relates back to the fact that these estimates serve as the foundation for economic analyses and contribute to the formulation of judgements and opinions by farmers and experts. In consulting statistical references, the FSD worker will discover that estimating responses or the magnitude of a difference requires more observations than do simple tests of significance of differences.
* In most cases, multiple-mean comparison procedures, such as least significant difference (LSD) and Duncan's, should be avoided in FSD. These are procedures to explore for -- some might say to fish for -- differences when there are no firm hypotheses about which of several treatments might be superior for the measurements evaluated, In principle, FSD works with ideas obtained from farmers or from station-based research. Invariably, information exists about the technical merit of these alternatives but these are still hypotheses as far as these farming conditions are concerned. (e.g., screening a large number of varietal introductions for adaptation to a new area).
* Questions can be asked in research trials that will provide powerful answers, even in simple trial designs. A common interest in FSD is to evaluate two or more alternatives that can be combined and progressively form a 'technology ladder' (see Section 6.4.2). Meaningful comparisons can be incorporated into the trial design and the analysis for this purpose. It is always appropriate for a researcher to discuss his or her ideas, early on, with statisticians to see whether they might be improved; for example, making a trial simpler or in some other way less demanding on participating farmers.
* A common attitude is that analysis of variance and regression tests are robust enough to handle some departure from the test assumptions about the data (e.g., homogeneous variances, normal distributions, etc.) and, as a result, the possibility of serious problems is ignored. When working in a highly variable farming environment, this attitude might be dangerous. For example, large differences in variance -- the spread between treatments on different farms -- could significantly upset a stability analysis result (see Section 10.4.3). Data can be transformed to correct this problem.
* A grossly under-utilized tool in FSD research is covariate analysis, As FSD work increases its emphasis on situation-specific assessments, aspects of the situation can be determined, measured, and incorporated into the analysis of the response, These technical variables, or covariates, might be physical, such as values relating to soil or weather situations, or socio-economic, such as the likelihood of a resource being available. Covariates are quantitative and continuous in nature. Some of the apparently qualitative criteria used to classify farms into recommendation domains could be represented quantitatively and used in covariate analysis.
* The principal objective in FSD analyses is to predict responses to farming alternatives on specific farms, at specific sites, and under specific circumstances across the target area. If FSD analyses have a predictive function, then they would tend to be characterized as follows.
* Predictive technical analysis will most often be based on statistical regression and related statistical techniques. However, other options exist that may become more prominent in the future (see Section 10.4.4).
* Two important requirements for obtaining accurate predictions of technical responses are:
-- That the data represent a sufficiently broad spread of environments and of the factors that affect the response. This spread must cover the full range of circumstances for which conclusions are sought. It would be highly inappropriate, for example, to make general conclusions based on responses measured only in years with below average rainfall. To achieve this spread of circumstances, numerous authors have written that in FSD work, it will be more important to include a larger number of farms rather than devote FSD and farmer resources to replications within the farm or field (see also Sections 9.5.1 and 9.5.2).
-- That trial designs be streamlined, straightforward, and convenient, such that farmers are able to accurately implement and manage trials in a manner consistent with their own management style. In FSD, this is usually given as another argument for single replications per field or farm.
* FSD researchers need to be vigilant in looking for variation in responses during technical analysis and for the possibility of unanticipated causal factors, These circumstantial responses might enable FSD to fine-tune recommendations for farmers. At the same time, a warning is in order, An initial set of responses should not be used to draw anything but a preliminary hypothesis about non-treatment factors causing a response. Doing otherwise will lead readily to spurious conclusions, if the response is related to chance or to some factor not identified properly.
If FSD researchers discover interesting responses that were not considered when the original trial was designed, these results need to be confirmed. Confirmation might include some or all of the following procedures.
* Review results with participants. Participants with their managerial expertise often are able to verity or reject initial hypotheses,
* Evaluate the scientific logic of the hypothesis (i.e., possibly involving outside experts).
* Re-do the trial designed in a manner that the preliminary hypothesis can be tested.
10.4.3 Modified Stability Analysis
In FSD, modified stability analysis (MSA) or adaptability analysis, as suggested recently by Hildebrand and Russell [1994], is being used increasingly to assess the biological performance of treatments (i.e., technologies) in different technical environments. When used judiciously, this analysis also can help assess technical feasibility under different farmers' management systems.
* Basis for Modified Stability Analysis. To better understand how these analyses are used, the basis for stability analysis is briefly examined. The performance of all treatments fall, or rise, depending on the harshness of the environment. The performance of stable treatments, however, is less susceptible to the effect of environment. The prediction of stability is achieved through the use of a statistical procedure. Estimates for statistics obtained in this procedure then are used as indicators of stability. Regression techniques are used in modified stability analysis. To date, such techniques have been underutilized in FSD work. In many respects, because of the difficulty of maintaining ceteris paribus conditions in experimental work undertaken at the farm level, regression analysis is intrinsically more suitable than analysis of variance in such situations [Stroup et al, 1991]
Stability analysis needs data from a multi-environment test. The same set of treatments is tested in each environment. Treatments could be varieties, tillage systems, and so on. Because the testing required for this procedure is expensive, having treatments without proven potential in at least one environment is not cost effective. A range of environments is obtained by conducting the test at different locations and seasons within a country or target area. A range of environments also can be created within one site by imposing another performance factor. For example, if several irrigation regimes are implemented at one site, the set of treatments can be tested in each regime. The test needs to cover the entire range of environments envisioned by the researcher as targets for these treatments.
In on-farm research, multi-environment tests are common, The testing of a technology to improve grain yield on a range of farms, in different villages, and over several seasons gives excellent data for stability analysis.
Stability is measured from a simple linear ( i.e., straight line) regression of the performance for one treatment on the index values of the environments. The environmental index is a value that is supposed to define the standard for performance in each environment. To visualize the analysis, consider a scatter diagram, The indices for environments are put on the horizontal axis and the measure of performance on the vertical axis, The environmental index points are not spaced equally. Two environments might have nearly the same index. The straight line regression shows how much change in performance of the treatment takes place for each change of the environmental index unit,
Performance of crop production treatments usually is measured as grain yield, But, performance also could be measured by other factors, such as crop establishment, plant height, weed levels following tillage treatments, etc. Criteria important to the farmer also could be used (e.g., net return per hectare, etc.), Therefore, in a sense, modified stability analysis potentially could be used to assess more than technical performance,
The regression analysis is easy; obtaining good measures of environmental indices is not, Measurements of rainfall, soil depth, and soil pH are examples of indices that have been used in stability analyses. As an example, stability analysis could show how much the yield of a tillage system changes with each 25 millimetre increase in seasonal rainfall. More often, indices are calculated from the performance of treatments themselves. Suppose yields for double-plough planting are regressed on yields of single-plough planting in data covering 120 farmer-implemented comparisons of these systems. The 120 single-ploughing yields become 120 environmental indices. The regression can explain how much change in double-ploughing yield takes place with each 10 kilogram increase in single-ploughing yield. In this ploughing example, yield of single-ploughing is a good measure of environment when this system is the standard for that area.
Usually, in practice, the standard performance is measured as the average of several or all the treatments. Statistically, this is a problem, because Y. the dependent variable in regression, is part of X, the independent variable. Their values are automatically related. Nonetheless, the average of treatments often is used as a measure of environmental index. Take a test of four cowpea varieties conducted on three farms in each of three villages with the test repeated for three seasons. For each of the 27 environments, the index can be calculated as the average yield of the four varieties. Stability is assessed separately for each variety by regressing variety yield on average yield.
For stability analysis to be of use, the range of environments must be adequate. Even though regression can give a prediction of outcomes for environmental indices beyond those in the data, the prediction is not likely to be accurate for environments that are far outside those of the test. Data drawn only from testing in wet seasons with high yields cannot be used to assess stability over dry and wet seasons. Data for stability analysis need to include a minimum of one environment from each end of a typical range of the indices.
In stability analysis, three regression statistics are used as indicators of stability: the coefficient of regression ('b'), the standard deviation of this coefficient (s[b]), and the treatment mean.
Because 'b' indicates the slope of the regression, it explains whether the performance of a treatment improves faster, slower, or the same as the environmental index, If the environmental index is expressed in the same units as treatments (e.g., yield), 'b' equals I when treatment and index increase at the same rate. The s[b] indicates how much the researcher can rely on the regression relationship. A high s[b] means that the performance of the treatment is erratic in good and poor environments. The mean, combined over environments, indicates the general ability of a treatment to perform well.
The stability or adaptation of treatments (i.e., technology) is defined as follows:
* With good stability or general adaptation, 'b' equals 1, mean performance is high, and s[b] is low. Other researchers feel that stability is highest when 'b' is less than 1 (i.e., the performance does not change much between poor and good environments), mean performance is high, and s[b] is low,
* With good specific adaptation, 'b' is significantly different from 1 (e.g., less if adapted to poor environments and more for better environments). To be considered good specific adaptation, the performance must be relatively high in the environments for which the treatment is adapted and the s[b] low.
* Poor adaptation is indicated by low performance means, regardless of the regression coefficient ('b') or s[b].
* Erratic performance is indicated by a high ski, regardless of performance mean or regression 'b'. Note that the performance of a treatment sometimes appears erratic because the treatment is interacting with factors that are not parts of the environmental index (e.g., a new sorghum hybrid does poorly in an otherwise good environment because of an adverse reaction to a soil factor).
* Adaptability Analysis. Adaptability analysis can be used in FSD to help in dividing farms into recommendation domains (see Section 4.5 and Box 10.1 ). When a technology is tested under farm conditions, a number of characteristics of the farm combine to make a unique environment: soil type, farm management, and so forth. Adaptability analysis capitalizes on each environment's capability to cause a particular yield response to each treatment and then provides the data platform on which the researcher can seek 'cause and effect' explanations for these responses.
The steps in adaptability analysis are the following:
* Conduct a trial with a common set of treatments in each environment, Usually in FSD, each environment is a different farm. It is strongly advised that the set of treatments include the farmer's conventional practice as a basis for making comparisons with farm environments outside of the trial.
* Regress treatment yields on the environmental index of each farm.
* Differentiate treatments that are favoured in the high-yielding environments from those that are superior in the medium- and in the low-yielding environments. It should be noted that these differences, which emerge as differences in regression slopes, may not be real if statistical tests for difference are not significant.
* Characterize high- and low-yielding environments further by looking for a non-experimental factor (e.g., soil factor, climatic factor, etc.) that is linked to the responses. The practical expertise of FSD staff and farmers is needed to identify factors that logically should link to different responses of trial treatments. To evaluate the factor-response relationship in an observational manner, the factor values can be plotted on the same regression graph used in the adaptability analysis. It is advisable to discuss with a statistician other tests (i.e., analysis of covariance) that might be used to assess how strong the relationship is between a factor of the environment and the trial responses. The factor that is chosen then is used to define the appropriate recommendation domains for the technologies that were tested in the trial.
This method of sorting farm environments works quite efficiently, if the causes of high or low performance are constant from year to year. However, in some environments, variation in weather or some other factors exerts a large influence on the relative performance of many treatments, This means that the relative performances of treatments might place the farm in one recommendation domain in one year and in another domain in the next season, Therefore, the use of adaptability analysis would need more years of data in areas with highly variable weather than in growing environments with more equable weather.
BOX 10.1: MSA CAN HELP DEFINE RECOMMENDATION DOMAINS
Farmers in the Manaus District of Brazil clear forested land to plant crops such as cowpeas. Soil fertility declines quickly and, after a few seasons, the land is abandoned. Research was conducted to define appropriate soil fertilization recommendations for this zone and different circumstances in this zone [Hildebrand and Russell, 1994]. MSA was used for data collected on 13 farms that each tested four potential fertilizer packages. This included one package that was the farmer's own practice of not applying fertilizer. For these farmers, cash is scarce and the major constraint to development, so the focus when assessing response was on the criterion of kilogrammes of cowpea per dollar of cash cost.
Following a step-by-step application of MSA to this problem, two recommendation domains were delineated and factors within the environments that characterize these two domains were identified. The message for extension of this MSA is that:
* The farmers' own practice would be appropriate in the first and second seasons after clearing land of primary forest and in the first season after clearing land of secondary forest.
* Chicken manure plus one-half dose of triple superphosphate fertilizer would be appropriate in later seasons and on waste land,
Because of its high cost, a full dose of triple superphosphate fertilizer would be too risky for most farmers. If it is used, it should be used only for the first or second seasons of planting.
10.4.4 Computer-Based Simulation
As of today, the use of simulation tools is not common in FSD technical analyses. However, the use of such knowledge-engineering methods has proved helpful in evaluating alternatives in other fields. These simulations permit the users to evaluate multitudinous alternatives, at least on a preliminary basis, without investing in the implementation of real-life trials. Simulation scenarios could involve technology or management alternatives, changes in the future circumstances of farming, and so forth. Simulation programmes in the future might prove to be a very effective means of organizing FSD data. These programmes might strengthen the linkage between knowledge systems (e.g., allowing participants to effectively interface with scientific knowledge frameworks).
Simulation is a developing area, however, and good tools are not presently available for most FSD analytical work. Criticisms of contemporary simulation models for use in FSD focus on their inability to:
* Accurately predict even biological responses over the range of circumstances encountered in real farming systems.
* Address aspects of farming related to human behaviour.
Solutions to some of these problems likely will be found. It is anticipated that simulation programmes, probably supporting an iteration between machine and human participants, will become part of the arsenal of FSD analytical tools of the future, particularly with respect to FSD with a 'natural resource systems focus' and with a 'livelihood systems focus' (Section 3.3).

10.5 Economic viability
10.5. 1 Overview
Tools for economic analysis are probably the least known on FSD teams, which is why some time is spent in this section outlining some of the main tools. Many other references also deal with the topics in much more detail.
Most limited-resource farming households produce a mix of products for household use and sometimes for selling, Livestock (i.e., cattle or small stock) may be sold whereas basic grain production is, if not subsistence production, is at least substitution production. There are many methods for analysing potential improved technologies in a formal manner from an economic viewpoint. Three critical issues underlying the legitimacy of many of the results of such analysis are:
* Measurement Problems in Doing On-Farm Trials in FSD. At times, it is not possible to collect all of the data needed for an economic analysis, or the data collected are suspect. It may be necessary to make estimations of individual data values or to use coefficients for some activities (i.e., particularly labour coefficients) in order to perform a particular analysis. With integrated trial design involving all team members and close supervision of field activities, the need for making estimates and for using coefficients can be reduced. Although it may be practical to use standardized coefficients for some labour activities, for example, broadcast planting or ploughing, which are common to all technologies being tested, it is important to collect actual labour data for activities that differ between treatments, such as weeding times where there is an additional tillage operation that may reduce weed burden on one of the trial plots. Obviously, it is desirable to have all
measurements as accurate as possible, but given field conditions, it may be necessary to settle for less than perfect data. Thus, the analysis performed should be appropriate for the quality of data that are collected.
* Placing Correct Values on the Inputs and Products not Originating from or Ending up in the Market Place. On the input side, for example, a particularly challenging issue is that of valuing family labour of which, the demand, and, therefore, the value are likely to vary seasonally. On the output side, there are many issues, for example, problems relating to valuing production consumed by household members, valuing manure from livestock that is used in production of crops, etc. However, guidelines are available on how to deal with these difficult issues. No matter how inputs and outputs are valued, it is important to explain carefully what has been done when reporting the results, so that others can evaluate the criteria for relevance to their situation and make adjustments accordingly.
* The Use of Evaluation Criteria Reflecting Those Important to the Household. Some issues relating to these have been covered in an earlier discussion (Section 10,3), One important requirement is to evaluate the results in terms of the most limiting factor, for example, return per hour used during critical bottleneck periods, rather than return per hectare. The latter is usually the major evaluation criterion used on experiment stations. Inappropriate use of such a criterion could leave researchers advocating irrelevant technologies and screening out others that could have been relevant.
As indicated earlier, techniques for economic analysis in FSD continue to be relatively simple. This is so because the relatively simple techniques are most readily understood by planners and non-economists, and because field data often are not sufficiently accurate to support complex analytical techniques. This latter reason is particularly significant where the price for most of the inputs and commodities is not determined in a market. Generally, economic analysis is carried out on the 'old' as well as the 'new, technology, in order to compare the technologies and to identify changes in the whole farm system caused by changing one part of the system.
The majority of economic analyses with reference to on-farm trial work in FSD fit in three categories:
* Average Returns Analysis. This analysis is the basis for most of the other analyses and consists of a listing of the average costs of producing a particular product and the average value of the product for each technology being compared. The cost- and-returns analysis requires information on both variable and fixed inputs, A more limited average variable cost-and-returns analysis often is used to compare different technologies that used the same fixed inputs. This information can be used to compare the average returns above variable costs (RAVC) (i.e., sometimes called gross margin analysis) for different technologies and the returns to other production factors such as total labour or ploughing labour, The process of valuing inputs and commodities its of particular importance in making realistic cost-and-return analyses.
* Budget Analysis. There are several types of budget analysis. The enterprise budget is a statement of costs-and-returns (i.e., both variable and fixed) for a particular enterprise or technology. This type of budget can be used as a building block in making whole farm budgets and in estimating the impact of a change to the new technology. The partial budget, on the other hand, is a direct comparison of the elements within enterprise budgets that change between technologies. This type of budget requires fewer data than the enterprise budget and offers the advantage of direct comparison. Finally, whole farm budgets can be used to look at allocation of resources between enterprises and at the impact of a new technology on the allocation of resources to other enterprises on a farm. The partial budget technique is used most frequently in FSD.
* Risk Analysis. When a farmer undertakes a crop or livestock enterprise, she/he aIways faces the risk of failure and loss of their time, cash, or other inputs invested in the enterprise. When farmers consider a new technology, they are concerned about the risk involved compared to the risk of their present technology. Measuring risk is difficult and of somewhat limited value, because different farmers look at risk differently. Risk analysis needs to be kept as simple as possible. Some indications of risk can be obtained from doing sensitivity analysis with partial budgets. Two additional tools used are stochastic dominance analysis, which assumes that farmers prefer more profit to less, and a modified safety-fret analysis, which provides information on the likelihood of returns from a technology falling below a minimum acceptable level.
Another type of economic analysis that is highly desirable is marginal analysis. Average returns and budget analysis are based on average data values acquired from a number of replications of a trial, all of which use about the same level of variable inputs. Thus, comparisons are being made between technologies based on a given level of inputs. Marginal analysis goes beyond the comparison of a given level of inputs and looks at profitability as levels of variable inputs change, This addition allows determinations as to the best (i.e., most efficient and profitable) allocation of resources for a given enterprise, Unfortunately, marginal analysis requires data over a wide range of inputs, something that is not available in much FSD work, so marginal analysis techniques, although valuable, have not been used widely, In practice, types of data required for marginal analysis are likely to be available only from RMRI type trials, which are not a major preoccupation of FSD work.
Therefore, the type of data available will influence the type of economic analysis that is possible. In the following sections, three major types of economic analyses commonly used are described briefly, namely average returns above variable costs (i.e., gross margin) analysis, partial budgeting and sensitivity analysis, and simplified risk analysis,
10.5.2 Gross Margin Analysis
An analysis of the average (i.e., mean) costs/benefits from different technologies being examined in a trial often is made, Where all of the relevant data have been collected, this type of analysis can be used, However, this requires valuation of both fixed and variable inputs, In many cases, the variable inputs are what need to be examined, because the fixed inputs are constant for all plots in the trial, Thus, the most common analysis performed involves the average returns above variable costs (RAVC) or gross margin approach. This allows a comparison between various technologies being tested based on the inputs the farmer must provide.
The procedure for gross margin analysis is:
* Calculate an average yield or an average amount of product for each separate technology,
* Calculate average inputs -- often with particular emphasis on labour inputs -- for each technology separately.
* Calculate the gross return (i.e., gross total value product), which is the yield times the appropriate field price for the product or products,
* Calculate the variable costs associated with each technology. The variable costs for a crop trial usually include labour; seed; draught hire (i.e., if hired draught is used); and a charge for equipment depreciation.
* The average return above variable cost -- also called net return or gross margin -- then is calculated by subtracting the variable costs from the gross total value product.
* These average net returns then can be compared between technologies, Some scientists believe that the return for a new technology must be at least 30 percent higher than that for the traditional technology before farmers will be willing to consider adopting it [Zandstra et al, 1981: p. 63].
This analysis generally is done on a per hectare basis, and the return calculated is a return to management, assuming that land is fixed and that labour has been valued at the price of its best alternative use (i.e., opportunity cost).
In order to maximize profits, it is necessary to maximize returns to the most limiting resource. For example, land may not be the most limiting resource, The most limiting resource may be traction time or labour for ploughing or weeding. When the most limiting resource is known, it is possible to calculate an average net return to that resource for the different technologies being compared and choose the most favourable technology. This procedure will not maximize the returns, because it does not examine different levels of inputs, but it will maximize the returns to the most limiting factor for a fixed level of inputs. For example, it is possible to calculate a return to weeding labour by omitting weeding labour costs (i.e., all other labour costs are included) from the cost total and then dividing the return by the number of hours of weeding labour, giving a return per hour of weeding labour.
10.5.3 Partial Budgeting
The partial budget is a way of analysing differences in costs and benefits of two or more competing enterprises or technologies. A good start for any economic analysis of a technology, including budgeting exercises, is to make a statement of the farmers' objectives, especially as they relate to the particular farm enterprise/technology.
The second step in any budgeting exercise is to make a detailed description of the technology or enterprise. For partial budgeting, it is necessary to be concerned only with those things that change from the existing technology to the proposed one. For budgeting in general, this step includes:
* Determining the 'unit of analysis'. The unit of analysis may be for an enterprise or technology, such as corn and bean production using an intercrop system from one hectare for one crop season, or the meat production from 100 goats for a year.
* Identifying of all operations that will be performed. For crops, this includes land preparation, tillage operations, applications of pesticides, fertilizers, etc., and marketing activities. For animals, it will include herding labour, milking, slaughtering, marketing, etc.
* Using data, where available, estimating the quantities of inputs for each operation (i.e., labour, chemicals, etc.).
* Determining the 'field price' of purchased inputs, equipment, labour, etc.' whether it is a cash cost or an opportunity cost. Multiply the price by the number of units to get a total cost for that input,
* Using data, where available, identifying the quantities of all outputs such as grain' fodder, meat, hides, etc.
* Determining a 'field price' for all outputs, whether sold or used by the household. Multiply the price by the number of units to get a total value for the particular benefit
Partial budgeting is a method of organizing data and information about the costs and benefits from some change in the technologies being used on the farm. Thus, partial budgets are useful tools for analysing small changes in farming systems and require less information than a whole farm budget or an enterprise budget, They measure changes in income and returns to limited resources; provide a limited assessment of risk; and, through sensitivity analysis, suggest a range of prices or costs at which a technology becomes profitable,
Partial budgets are not used to estimate the total income and costs for each of the technologies being considered. The goal is to estimate the difference in benefits or losses expected from the technologies. The partial budget technique is most useful where the new technology consists of the existing technology with one or two changes. The following steps are used in creating a partial budget:
* Identify the elements in the production process that are different (i.e., such as purchased inputs, different labour requirements, etc.).
* Quantify inputs that are different for the technologies.
* Calculate a 'field value' (i.e., quantity used times field price) for each input.
* Also identify, quantify, and value outputs that are different.
* Organize this information as outlined in Table 10.2, resulting in a presentation of information such as is given in Table 10.3,
To interpret this partial budget (Table 10.3), note that the increase in benefits more than makes up for the reductions in benefits, Even though more costs are associated with the new technology, there is a net gain of almost P20 per hectare from using the new technology (i.e., double ploughing) over the traditional (i.e., single ploughing) technology. In its most simple interpretation, it does pay to switch from single ploughing to double ploughing in conditions similar to those where the tests took place. The change (i.e., increase) in benefits was larger than the change (i.e., increase) in costs necessary to produce that benefit.
It is also possible to look at changes that are likely to occur if prices, yields, or input requirements change. In other words, it is possible to investigate how sensitive the results are likely to be to such changes -- a primitive measure of risk. This is done easily by setting the partial budget up on a spreadsheet such as Lotus 123. Table 10.3 shows the results that will occur if the value of labour increased or decreased by 50 percent, and what the wage rate would need to be if no increase occurred in net return from double ploughing compared with single ploughing.

A partial budget is easy to interpret. However, it rarely is presented with a statement of the farmer's objectives, the farmer's resource base, and important non-cash considerations. A first consideration should be the question: does the criterion of increasing net benefit per hectare imply that it is in the farmer's interest to maximize returns to land? Often, this is not the case. The partial budget does not indicate if the draught and labour are available to the farmer to do a second ploughing, or if the farmer has the capital to hire a second ploughing, if ploughing is done through a hire arrangement. For many farmers, the availability of labour or capital may be more constraining than the availability of land. As has been repeatedly emphasized, the evaluation criterion used should maximize returns to the most constraining variable.
Although it a useful technique, there are limits to its value. Three problems that partial budgets do not address directly are:
* While a partial budget gives an indication of which of two or more technologies is 'better', it does not answer the question as to which technology is 'the best'.
* The partial budget may indicate that the new technology is 'better' than the traditional technology, but it will not show that both technologies produce a loss. An enterprise budget would show this type of information.
* The partial budget may indicate that a new technology is 'better' than an existing technology, but not the 'best' level at which to use the new technology. For example? feeding a supplement to dairy cattle is better than feeding no supplement, but partial budgeting will not tell how much supplement is most profitable to teed.

10.5.4 Risk Analysis
Unfortunately, not all inputs are under the farmer's control. In Botswana, one of the most critical inputs for rainfed agriculture is soil moisture. There is a great deal of variability in rainfall between years, within years, and even between plots in the same village. This highly variable rainfall introduces a great deal of risk and/or uncertainty into the farming system. There may be other sources of risk as well, such as uncertainty about the availability of seed or traction. Farmers consider risk in their farming system and make adjustments to compensate. In Botswana, one of the traditional methods of addressing risk is to plant a large number of plots over a period of time in order to take advantage of the rains that do come. Another risk-reducing mechanism is to keep the investment of labour and cash in arable agriculture as low as possible. Thus, the farmer will not weed a plot if he/she thinks that plot will fail.
By looking at the distribution (i.e., range) of returns from experiments, it is possible to obtain some information on how risky a particular technology may be. There are several simple tools for looking at the distribution of returns, which can help in examining the question of risk. A very primitive method was indicated in the preceding section. It was shown that partial budgets also can be used to assess risk when a sensitivity analysis is included to show expected net gains from changes in levels of certain variable inputs/outputs and/or their prices (see Table 10.3).
In the real world, no two farmers have the same attitude toward risk. Some are more inclined to take risky actions (e.g., before, during, or after the cropping season) with the ultimate hope of receiving a larger return on their investment of labour and cash. Some are less inclined to do so. When one interprets farmers' risk attitudes, it is important to assume that they realize a trade-off may exist between getting a greater return from a technology and assuring stability in the return (i.e., that there are few years with little or no return).
Farmers generally are grouped into three categories in relation to their attitudes toward risk.
* Risk Averse. Farmers who are willing to sacrifice high expected yields and returns in order to keep the risk of low income and loss at a minimum. This type of farmer is conservative in his/her approach to decision making.
* Risk Preferring. Farmers who will go after the highest yields and expected returns, even though there is a good possibility that they will receive a low income or suffer a loss in many years. This type of farmer is liberal in his/her approach to decision-making.
* Risk Neutral. Farmers who choose the technology with the highest expected yield or return, without considering the potential for losses.
Farmers may fall into different groups depending on the season, the amount of resources available at that particular time, the magnitude of the cost, and the potential gains and losses from a given technology. When FSD workers interpret risk for technologies, it is important to remember that farmers will look at risk differently and so may fall into different recommendation domains based on their attitude towards the risk involved in a particular technology. However, in general, particularly with reference to major enterprises, limited- resource farmers in low income countries are likely to have a risk-averse attitude.
Generally, a farmer will have some idea of the risk of crop failure under the cropping system he/she currently uses. When considering a shift to a different cropping system, the farmer usually thinks not only of the cost of additional inputs (i.e., labour and cash) and the potential net gain in returns (i.e., whether considered in terms of yield or cash value), but also the increased or decreased risk of having a crop failure. If farmers think that risk will be increased under a new technology, they often will want to see a larger net gain from the shift to compensate for the increased risk. An increase in yield or net returns of 30 percent over the existing technology is probably the minimum increase that most farmers will consider acceptable before they adopt the technology. The opposite is also true. A perceived decrease in risk will often induce farmers to shift technologies, even if the gains from doing so are small.
Actual measurement of farmers' risk attitudes is very complex and not practical, because the attitudes are always changing, Thus, methods for estimating risk are based on the actual data collected in trial work, rather than trying to measure farmers' attitudes toward risk,
Two simple ways of analysing risk that depend on the outcomes from trials comparing new technologies to existing technologies are as follows:
* Safety-First Analysis. Most farmers are concerned not only with the highest yield, or return, they can get from a technology but also with the possibilities of getting little or no yield or return and, in fact, suffering a loss. Safety-first analysis looks at the results of trials comparing a new technology and a traditional technology and asks which technology will meet a chosen minimum standard -- a minimum yield or a minimum income -- most often. Alternatively, safety first can indicate which technology will produce a loss the least often. For some farmers, it is very important to have a certain amount of grain produced or the family will go hungry. For this type of farmer, it does not matter how high a yield may be possible with a new technology; if his/her family will go hungry more often under the new technology than under the old, his/her family will not switch.
Strictly speaking, a safety-first analysis is the probability (i.e., percentage of the time) that a technology exceeds a specified output level. Two or more technologies can be compared, and the one that produces at least the desired output level the highest percentage of the time is preferred. A second way of looking at the same issue is to determine the percentage of the time that a technology falls below a specific minimum level that must be reached. Table 10.4 provides some data on the percentage of times that some factors, considered in singleploughing and double-ploughing trials, were above the specified minimum. It appears that double ploughing was generally better in this measure of risk than single ploughing.
* Other Distributional Analysis. Although the safety-first risk-analysis method uses the distributions of trial outcomes in examining risk' it is also helpful to look at some of the traditional measures of distributions to get clues as to how the technologies will be assessed for risk. The traditional way of reporting trials data is to look at the arithmetic mean. The technology with the greater mean yield generally is preferred. However, one year of very good results, combined with several years of very poor results, may give a higher mean than several years of average results. And a farmer may prefer to have a steady return rather than one that fluctuates a great deal. Thus, it may help to look at the data in more depth.
One way to provide more information to the farmer is to compare the median, which is the value that is half way between the highest and the lowest value, with the mean. If the median is less than the mean, it indicates that the farmer will receive less than the mean return more than half of the time. It may be helpful to look at how much difference there is between the mean and the median. If there is little difference, then the farmer will receive close to the mean most of the time. A lot of difference may indicate a few really good returns for the technology and many rather poor ones. Actually graphing the distribution can help in determining what is happening in the relation of means and medians. These are some indications of the skewness of a distribution.
Another potentially useful measure is the percentage of the time that a farmer can expect to receive a yield or return less than the mean yield or return. If this percentage is high, it generally indicates a situation of a few good and many poor yields or returns. Table 10.4 provides information on the mean, median, and percentage of times the yield or return was less for some single-ploughing and double-ploughing data. Although, in general, both the mean and the median were greater for the double ploughing, indicating a possible overall advantage, the percentage of the time that single ploughing was less than the mean was smaller than for double ploughing, indicating that double ploughing may be somewhat less stable.
FSD workers may want to consider using an average of the five lowest yields rather than just the lowest yield for comparison purposes. In the case of the data from Table 1().4, the lowest yield for both single ploughing and double ploughing was zero (i.e., no yield). This produced net losses of P2.70 for single ploughing and P5.70 for double ploughing. Comparing an average of the five lowest yields gave average of 1.8 kilograms/hectare for single ploughing (i.e., average return of minus P 1 .97), whereas the five lowest yields for the double ploughing averaged 19.4 kilograms/hectare (i.e., average return of P2.90). This implies, that all other things being equal, farmers may prefer the double-ploughing technology. This method is sometimes called minimum returns analysis [CIMMYT, 1988A].

10.6 Social/societal acceptability
Evaluating technologies from a social/societal viewpoint has two dimensions. These are to evaluate it from the viewpoint of:
* Relations among people in the present generation (i.e., intra or within generation)
* Relations between the current and future generation (i.e., inter or between generation ) -- that is, ecological sustainability.
Although individual farmers in the current generation, particularly if they are very close to the survival level, are not likely to be too concerned with intergenerational relationships, it is more difficult to separate out broader societal issues and social acceptability as far as the individual farming family is concerned with respect to intra-generational relationships, As far as the individual farming household is concerned, intra- or within-household relationships are likely to be important in assessing the social acceptability of a proposed improved technology, but such households may, or may not, be too concerned about what is likely to happen to relationships between households if the technology is adopted, Therefore, no attempt is made in the following discussion to differentiate social issues of interest to the individual farming family from the collective interests of society as a whole, In any case, individual farming households influence, and are influenced by,
what is acceptable to society as a whole,
10.6.1 Present Generation Relationships
Because individual household members are differentiated and households are also members of the community, social criteria include both effects within the household (intra-household) and across households in the village as a whole (inter-household).
A couple of important intra-household social criteria include:
* Gender Issues, What would be the effects of the proposed technology on other activities undertaken by women and men? For example, would more frequent weeding by women reduce time available to them for child care? Would a technology that decreases work for the men increase work for the women in the household? Thanks to the work of Feldstein, Flora, Poats, and Jiggins, methodologies have been developed in recent years to evaluate such gender issues, It is important to identify who in the household is the decision maker with reference to the enterprise or operation the technology relates to, who controls and applies the resources assigned to it, and who reaps the benefit. If the same person is not connected with all three, then complications will arise in designing relevant technologies for improving its productivity that will be attractive to all parties, For example, men could require women to work harder as a result of the introduction of a new technology in an
enterprise or operation concerning which they are the decision makers and from which they themselves reap the benefit.
* Short-Term Livelihood Issues. What would be the effects of the proposed technology on the seasonal cash, resource demand, production, and consumption flows of the household? For farming households very close to the survival level, any technology that is likely to exacerbate seasonal flows with respect to any of these are likely to be socially unacceptable. With respect to the production/consumption relationship, poor seasonal synchronization between the two and the poor overall level of production often result in seasonal hunger. In many parts of the world, this in turn, may, result in differentiation in levels of nutrition of individuals within households, according to gender and age. The prospects of such problems, combined with the uncertainty of the climate in many areas where limited-resource farmers operate and the general low level of living, predisposes such households to implement not only strategies to try and minimize production risk but also closely related
coping strategies of various types to try and maintain household security, This enables them to consume during periods when production is deficient [Frankenberger and Goldstein, 1990; Jodha,1990]. Some of these can adversely affect future productivity. Obvious examples would be selling off productive assets (e.g., animals used for draught purposes) and obtaining access to food at high rates of implicit interest (e.g., repayment in terms of labour at busy times in the farming cycle) or explicit interest, It is important to know if such coping strategies exist, whether they are among the factors determining how risk averse such households are likely to be. They also indicate how much reliability can be placed on the availability of cash for improving the productivity of the farming system, in contrast to buying food to ensure survival.
Other social criteria involve inter-household relations, These may involve changes within the community, if new technologies are adopted. Some of these criteria include:
* Effects of proposed technologies on labour-sharing or food-sharing networks. For example, does the increased ploughing time required for double ploughing mean that the family traction will not be available to other members of the extended family'?
* Effects of proposed technologies on differences in power and status among different people in the community.
Some of the community-based social criteria involve preferences and taboos. For example:
* Cultural or religious preferences for a specific crop or animal management practice. An example would be the practice of keeping animals as a store of wealth to be used in a time of need, rather than being sold on a regular basis.
* Cultural or religious taboos against specific crop management practices. An example would be having to delay ploughing at the beginning of the rainy season until the village leadership gives permission.
Social criteria also can effect economic and agronomic criteria, The use of cattle as a store of wealth means that farmers may not want to reduce their value by using them as traction animals.
Therefore, it is important to evaluate potential improved technologies for possible negative social impacts.
10.6.2 Ecological Sustainability (i.e., Future Generation Relationships)
Another part of the societal evaluation is to determine whether the proposed technologies contribute positively to -- or at least do not have a negative impact on -- the sustainability of the land in the long-run, However, until recently, this has received insufficient attention in evaluating technologies, Reasons for this neglect include:
* The primary effort of FSD has been to respond to the 'felt' needs articulated by farmers. The closer farmers are to the survival level, the more likely these needs will demand fulfillment in the short-term (e.g., producing enough food to survive until next year). As a result, farmers will be less concerned about environmental degradation in the long-term,
* Because of responding to the 'felt' needs of farmers, much FSD work generally has a short-run focus, This is in contrast to a long-run orientation in which societal impacts become more crucial, The short-term focus, combined with the methodological complexity of incorporating societal evaluation criteria and the time required in deriving such societal impact evaluations, has meant that FSD has played a limited role in this area, Emphasis on long-term evaluation has been confined largely to subjective ex ante evaluations, Such evaluations influence choices of problems to work with and the solutions to be advocated,
* Most FSD, because of its institutional affiliation, tends to concentrate on the development of relevant improved technology, It is possible to develop technologies that do not have a negative impact on the environment -- particularly the agro- ecological environment, such as soils, and, to a much lesser extent, the socio-economic environment in the equitable distribution of benefits, However, it is the implementation of relevant policy/support systems that play an even more important role in making sure that societal goals are fulfilled,
Although recognizing the dilemmas implied by the above discussion, it is important to bear in mind that what is done now by the current generation of farmers has a bearing on what is possible in the future, A prime example of this is the issue of environmental stability recognizing the negative impact of environmental degradation on the livelihood of future farming families and possibly on the whole of society,
Current adoption of technologies and implementation of policy/support programmes can have either negative or positive influences on environmental stability. Hopefully, as discussed above, technologies developed by researchers increasingly are being screened ex ante for their possible environmental impact. In most countries, there is an explicit concern for conserving the productivity of the soil, Because of the likely short-run focus of most limited-resource farming families, conservation measures by themselves are unlikely to be very attractive to most of them, However, production does not have to be undertaken at the expense of conservation, as long as the people responsible for developing technologies and policy support programmes take conservation into consideration, through linking policies designed to encourage production with those designed to encourage conservation [Norman and Douglas, 1994],
The objective of this discussion is simply to emphasize the need to be aware of the possible conflict between farmers' and societal needs and the importance of technology and policies supporting each other in developing a system of agriculture that will help provide satisfactory levels of living, not only for the current generation of farmers, but also for future generations. Unfortunately, appropriate methodologies for handling these types of the issues still remain to be fully developed.
10.7 Formulating recommendations
The first important point to make with reference to this topic is that the results from the evaluation procedure determine whether a recommendation is made for extending the technology through the extension service.
Information required for approving recommendations often has consisted of hard objective data collected in an RMRI experimental environment. However, there is an increasing acceptance of the need to conduct a socio-economic evaluation, as well as the more common technical analysis. To more closely approach the farmers' operational environment, much of the data required are collected best in an RMFI experimental environment. However, there is likely to be a corresponding increase in the softness of the data -- thereby, for some, potentially reducing its acceptability in the technology evaluation process. Increasing amounts of qualitative attitudinal data, collected at the FMFI level, are likely, for some, to be even more suspect in such an evaluation exercise. As has been emphasized earlier, it is unfortunate that a move towards greater incorporation of the farmer -- the ultimate customer of trial work -- in the evaluation process has a tendency to result in a more
qualitative/softer type of data that is generally less acceptable in approving official recommendations. There is obviously no easy solution to this problem, but it is apparent that a judicious mix of hard/quantitative and soft/qualitative data may be useful in the evaluation process (Box 10.2).
Scientific objectivity, requiring many years of painstaking experimental work -- often in a somewhat artificial environment -- should not be substituted completely for researcher judgement. Resources for research are limited, and ways need to be sought to maximize the return from them, so as to facilitate the agricultural development process.
With respect to this. it its important that the recommendations are formulated and passed on to extension at the earliest possible opportunity, in order to maximize their impact on the farming population. Although it is desirable to defer making recommendations until some adoption has occurred, this often results in unacceptable time delays. Rather, recommendations need to be based largely on ex ante evaluation. Because of limited research resources and diverse interests of groups using research results, it would be desirable to see a move toward devising interim best-bet recommendations, based on the best knowledge currently available to the research scientists. These should have the proviso that they can be modified in the light of further research. Of course, there is an inherent danger in doing this, especially if an interim recommendation has any possibility of adversely affecting the environment or farmers' welfare. However, if the relevant interested parties are
brought together? it should be possible to avoid drawing up inappropriate recommendations.
In an earlier section (see Section 5.9.2), mention was made of the desirability of incorporating conditional clauses and targeting information into recommendations. Much of the information needed for this process does not require exhaustive experimentation but can be derived from the knowledge and experiences of trained scientists working at the farm level. Thus, in recognizing the diversity of farmers, on-farm trials can help in developing targeted and conditional clauses for proposed improved technologies. Doing so can potentially improve the return from the limited research resources by providing a technology that is appropriate to more farmers through widening intervention possibilities. It is particularly important to develop a range of options when dealing with a difficult farming environment (Box 10,3). Such guidelines indicate how greater numbers of farmers can more closely approach the optimal situation.
BOX 10.2: USING LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO MODIFY RECOMMENDATIONS
An experience of the Communication for Technology Transfer in Agriculture (CTTA) project in the Callejn de Huaylas, Ancash, Peru shows how technology developed on research stations can be modified in light of local needs and knowledge [Mate, 1992],
Farmers in the Callejn de Huaylas had reported that the potato worm (Premnotrypes sp.), called 'papakuru,' was one of their most serious pests on potato, In response, station scientists developed a double chemical treatment recommendation for control of this pest, The recommendation, comprising a curator powder application at planting and a volaton treatment at hilling, placed a high demand on draught and labour during ploughing and planting and this was unacceptable.
Farmers rejected the two chemical treatment but, working with the scientists, developed a compromise recommendation, Farmers knew that rotating potatoes with maize would help in controlling 'papa-kuru,' They knew that moistened seed would develop a bitterness less palatable to the pest, They also knew that exposing ploughed soil to the sun and bird predation for a few days before planting would also reduce populations of the pest, The compromise recommendation consisted of these known measures of control as a substitute for the curator powder application at planting combined with the volaton treatment at hilling, Volaton is an insecticide that is readily available and also affordable to most farmers.
The tone of the above discussion suggests that, generally, 'blanket' type recommendations are likely to have very limited value. Much wider adoption is likely to occur, if a number of options are offered to farmers and the recommendations are tied more closely to the farmers' own production environment, Consequently, in recognition of this, there is increasingly a move away from recommendations being approved at the national level to an approach where they can be approved at a more localised level (e.g., regional) by a group representing the different 'actors' in the agricultural development process at that level (e.g., something like a Regional Coordinating Committee (see Section 6.3.2)). Such a trend is obviously desirable, enabling decisions on recommendations to be made in a more timely manner and to be made by individuals who are more familiar with the local production environment. It is important to note, however, that a role still exists for some coordination of
recommendations at the national level to:
* Provide a documentation role in terms of the status of appropriate technology available in the country.
* Play a distribution role in suggesting extension of technological recommendations to other areas with similar production environments.
* Provide a forum or conduit for technologies that require changes in policy/support systems to facilitate their adoption (e.g., facilitating multiplication of newly approved crop varieties).
BOX 10.3: OFFER THE FARMER OPTIONS INSTEAD OF PRESCRIPTIONS
The N.D. University of Agriculture and Technology (NDUAT), Faizabad, India, developed an on farm experimentation approach to reach resource-poor farming communities [Maurya, 1992]. Most farmers in these communities had missed the benefits of the Green Revolution with its packages of optimal recommendations.
The NDUAT approach stressed work with whole communities. It stressed the farmer's own criteria. It stressed making options available, even when these did not appear to be the 'best' choice. The NDUAT attempted to build a new aptitude among farmers of experimentation, critical evaluation, continued innovation, and adoption as appropriate.
During an 8-year period of on-farm work, more than 700 farmers tried options in the production areas of field crops, vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, goats, pigs, and fish. The NDUAT even introduced station 'rejects' to farmers, such as genotypes that would no longer be carried by station breeding and screening programmes.
10.8 A case study: Example of double ploughing technology in Botswana
Over the years in Botswana, FSD teams did a great deal of work on double ploughing which has now been approved as a recommendation [Heinrich et al, 1990]. A summary of the results, presented in the following tables (i.e., Tables 10.5 to 10.8), illustrates many of the points made in this chapter,
Conclusions on double ploughing were that it was suitable when:
* The first ploughing is done when planting is not possible (i.e., an option),
* Farmers control draught power and are faced with land constraint and/or lack labour for weeding.
* It is concentrated on deeper soils with higher clay fractions enabling higher water holding capacity (i.e., targeting information),
Later work looked at early ploughing plus other alternatives. Table 10.8 provides guidelines as to what can be done with different levels of control over traction and different types of seasons. The table contains both conditional and targeting information.

a. Most of the data in this table are derived from results presented in Worman [1987] and involve trials for which labour data were recorded. The trials were research managed and farmer implemented (RMFI) with a sample size of 20. Planting of the single- and double- ploughed plots was done on the same day. Figures in the table are the average/plot.
b. Preparation time includes ploughing and planting.
c. Consists of weeding time only.
d. Gross return equals yield times price where the price of sorghum is PO.43/kg.
e. Net return equals gross return minus costs where costs equals seed (P0.30/kg for 4 kg) plus depreciation on equipment (estimated at P1.50/ha). In this calculation, labour has not been costed.
f. The difference has been the opposite way round for other trials undertaken at both Francistown and Mahalapye. From a sample size of 59 paired comparisons, the average weeding times per hectare for single and double ploughing were 34 and 19 hours, respectively. This makes the return per hour of weeding on double-ploughed plots even bettre.

10.9 Ways to assess adoptions
One of the questions of interest to all members of a FSD team is to what extent farmers are adopting recommended practices. Adoption analysis can be performed on technologies that have been tested extensively in FMFI trials within ? recommendation domain and are ready for extension. The potential for adoption of the technology can be assessed by determining the adoption among the farmers who performed the final verification (FMFI) trials on the technology. It also may be of interest to know how many farmers are adopting technologies that they have been testing on a more limited scale as part of a research programme.
It is desirable to know whether farmers are likely to adopt a particular technology before it is presented on a large scale through the extension system. If farmers are not willing to adopt the technology after the final large - scale testing, it may need to be modified to increase acceptability.

b. These results indicate the comparison for double ploughing a single hectare or single ploughing two hectares when the first hectare is planted at the time of the first ploughing. However, the combined results from this planting and from the hectare planted on the same day as double ploughing do not really provide a valid comparison with double ploughing, because it is recommended that the first ploughing be done when there is not enough soil moisture for planting (i.e., the yield for planting at this time would approach zero), The figures in brackets reflect the average values of the two hectares combined.

There are several ways to assess the likelihood of adoption of a technology,
* The researchers make an assessment of the adoptability of each technology through their analysis of the technological, economic, and social factors that they think are important to farmers.
* Observations and discussions with farmers during the course of testing, particularly during a final large-scale verification (FMFI) test, can give an indication of problems and provide the researcher with a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of adoption.
* A formal end-of-season survey of farmers or PRA techniques can be used to assess their plans to adopt the new technology and determine any problems encountered,
* The best approach is to examine actual adoption by conducting a survey one or two years following the large-scale testing of a technology to determine whether farmers who participated in the testing actually have adopted the practice and to what extent,
* A study of other farmers in the area (i.e., those not involved in the testing of the technology) also can be made to determine the extent of horizontal or farmer-to-farmer diffusion.

The first three approaches above are qualitative in nature and measure farmers' intentions either as expressed or deduced by researchers. The last two approaches measure actual adoption and are quantitative in nature.
One approach to quantifying adoption is to use the index of acceptability suggested by Hildebrand and Poey [1985: pp. 122-123]. To determine the index of acceptability for a particular technology, information is collected from farmers one or two years after they have participated in large-scale testing of a technology. Farmers are asked if they are using the technology, and if so, on what proportion of the area of the particular crop for which it was recommended. An index of acceptability then can be calculated as follows:
I[a] = (C x A)  100
Where:
I[a] = Index of acceptability
C = The percentage of the farmers interviewed who participated in the large scale testing and who were using the technology on at least part of the crop at the time of the interview.

A = From among those farmers who used the practice that year? the percentage of the area they planted with the new technology compared to the total area planted to the particular crop (e.g., the area planted to a new sorghum technology as a percentage of the total area planted to sorghum).
For example, if 150 farmers participated in the test of a double-ploughing technology, and after two years a survey found that 65 were using double ploughing on at least part of the land they planted, then 'C' would be 65 . 150 = 43 percent, The average area planted using double ploughing by the 65 farmers was 4.3 hectares. These same farmers planted an average of 6.1 total hectares. Thus, 'A' would be 4,3 . 6,1 = 70 percent, The index of acceptability would be (43 x 70) .- 100 = 30,1,
BOX 10.4: ACCEPTABILITY INDICES CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INSIGHTS ON SPONTANEOUS ADOPTION
In 1989, a study of spontaneous adoption was undertaken in one region of Botswana [Wortnan, Williams et al, 19901, The degrees of adoption of a number of technologies were assessed, including double ploughing, row planting, combination of double ploughing and row planting, and use of fertilizer. These were technologies that the FSD team had tested with farmers over the years.
The results indicated that 26 percent of the interviewed farmers had spontaneously adopted at least one of the technologies, On average, 35 percent of the crop land planted by adopters was devoted to the new technologies. Overall, the index of acceptability amounted to 9.2. Some additional insights obtained from examining the results were:
* How complicated the technology is to implement affected the adoption. The relatively simple double-ploughing technology had an index of acceptability of 26 compared to the more complicated (i.e., requiring more management skills) row-planting technology, which had an index of acceptability of 14.
* As might be expected, wealth influenced adoption, Wealthier farmers were more likely to adopt technologies, with an index of acceptability of 19 for farmers owning more than 40 cattle compared to 0.7 for the poorest farmers who owned no cattle.
* The environment in which the household operates is important in determining adoption, with the farmers from a more 'progressive' village having an index of acceptability of 19 compared to I for the farmers from a more 'traditional' village.
A rule of thumb for interpreting the index of acceptability is that a technology has a good chance of being adopted if I[a] exceeds 25 and 'C' is equal to or greater than 50 [Hildebrand and Poey, 1985: p. 122]. This is a measure of acceptability to the farmer and does not reflect the impact of the technology. It is also important to consider the magnitude of both 'C' and 'A,, It is possible to have a very low 'C,, indicating that few farmers are adopting the technology, combined with a high 'A,, indicating that those using the technology were using it on a large portion of the land planted to the crop, This could be because a sub-group of the recommendation-domain farmers find the technology particularly valuable, although it is not accepted by most farmers, This also may indicate that different recommendation domains are present. The opposite situation, where a large number of farmers are using the technology on a small portion of the area planted to the crop, could
indicate that farmers are still testing the technology, are not yet convinced that it should be 'adopted', or have adopted the technology as a component of a more complex cropping system. An additional survey in the following year may be valuable in assessing the adoption, or some modification may be necessary to promote adoption.
The index of acceptability procedure is designed for analysing the adoption of a particular technology, usually for a single crop, for farmers in a specific recommendation domain (Box 10.4), If it is used to measure adoption under other circumstances, such as a measure of spontaneous adoption on a range of new technologies, the interpretation of the results will be different, and the numbers suggested above probably will not be relevant. Instead, comparison of the index of acceptability between technologies or by farmer characteristics (i.e., indicating possible recommendation domain delineations) may be of value.
Finally, as indicated in an earlier section (Section 5.10.2) increasing emphasis is being placed now on looking at the impact of research as a whole. Adoption of technologies developed earlier by the research system and disseminated through the extension system is considered an important indicator of the return from such investments. Methodologies for undertaking such studies now are becoming readily available -- see, for example, CIMMYT [1993].

Appendix A3: Estimating crop densities and yields
In FSD trial work measurement of crop densities and yields are often two of the most important activities. The following sections illustrate the complexity of such activities and, in doing so, also indicate the necessity of often having to adjust the methodology to the local situation, in this case to the semi-arid climate of Botswana.
A3.1 Introduction and use of density measurement
After grain yield, plant density is the most important direct measurement in on-farm crop trials. Plant populations vary greatly among planted areas in Botswana. Different technologies and other causes can influence the percent of seeds sown that emerge and become useful plants. In FSD, plant density measurements are used to estimate the percent field emergence.
The FSD researcher should measure plant density when most of the plants of the eventual crop stand are emerged and established. Establishment is a relative term, but with sorghum it is usually four to six weeks after first emergence. Established plants generally have sent roots into the sub-soil below the ploughing layer. The researcher often wishes to measure the percentage of seeds sown that became established as the response variable. Two ways to calculate percent field emergence are:
* When it is assumed that all the seeds sown are viable:
Percent field emergence = [100 x crop stand (plants/ha)] / number seeds (seeds/ha)
* When a seed viability test is conducted to test the percent of seed that can germinate:
Percent field emergence = [100 x crop stand (plants/ha) x % seed viable] / number seed (seeds/ha)
Note: Researchers not farmers, usually measure population density. When it is not possible or desirable to conduct a stand count for a whole plot, it is necessary to use some sampling procedure. FSD staff in Botswana frequently use the systematic quadrat sampling technique, In the following sub-sections, this method plus several of its variants is discussed,
A3.2 Measuring plant densities
A3.2. 1 Systematic Quadrat Sampling for Broadcast Planting
The procedure consists of the following steps:
* Sub-Sampling. Sub-sample the plot with a 2m by 2m quadrat. Take 20 quadrat sub samples in a systematic pattern. Usually, this pattern consists of two passes through the plot each with 10 equally spaced sub-samples. Preferably, two people carry the quadrat, count plants, and record data. The front carrier follows a sampling line and the rear carrier counts paces. The rear carrier places the quadrat on the ground, without bias, at the point of his or her toe,
* Data Collection. In each sub-sample, count and record the number of plants of the crop,
* Calculate Crop Stand. This is done as follows:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = [average number plants per quadrat x 10,000 quadrat length (metres)] / quadrat width (metres)
For example, if there is an average of 8.3 sorghum plants per sub-sample and a quadrat sub-sample of 2m by 2m, the:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = (8.3 x 10,000)/(2 x 2) = 20,750 plants/ha.
Note: When the shape of the plot is long and narrow or of another irregular shape, the sub-sampling pattern should be such that quadrat sub-samples are spaced as equally throughout the plot as is possible.
A3.2.2 Systematic Quadrat Sampling for Row Planting
* Sub-Sampling. Sub-sampling for row-planted plots is similar to that for broadcast planting. The pattern for rows consists of two passes, each with 10 equally spaced sub samples. Each pass follows rows near, but not on, the border, Therefore, select rows that are one-fourth of the plot width from the border.
* Data Collection. The procedure is similar to that for broadcast plots. The main difference is that for row planting, the number of rows in each sub- sample is recorded. The number of rows sampled should remain the same for all sub-samples in a plot. When row spacing is 0,75 metres, two rows should be included in each sub- sample,
* Calculate Crop Stand. This is done as follows:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = [average number plants per quadrat x 10,000] / [number rows in quadrat x quadrat length (metres) x row spacing (metres)]
For example, with an average of 7.4 sorghum plants per sub-sample, when each quadrat sub-sample is 2m x 2m, with an average row spacing of 0,75 metres, and two rows in the sub-sample, then the:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = (7,4 x 10,000)/(2 x 2 x ().75) = 24,667 plants/ha.
Note: Researchers should avoid sampling in rows where the plant stand is unusual due to a cause other than the treatment. The most common example is blockage of a planter during one pass through the plot. When this problem is observed, a neighbouring, but not adjacent, row is sampled.
A3.2.3 Row Segment Measurement for Row Planting
* Sub-Sampling. Sub-sampling is on segments of rows. This method is similar to the systematic quadrat method for row planting The main difference is the use of a measuring stick or measuring string to mark the row segment instead of a square quadrat.
* Data Collection. Data collection is also similar to that of the systematic quadrat method for row planting. The segment length is recorded as the length of the stick or other measuring device used.
* Calculate Crop Stand. This is done as follows:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = [average number plants per segment x 10,000] / [segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres)]
For example, with an average of 21.4 sorghum plants per segment sample, each segment having a length of 1() metres, and average row spacing of 0.75 metres, then the:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = (21.4 x 10,000)/(10 x 0.75) = 28,533 plants/ha.
If more than one row in the segment sub-sample is included, then:
Crop stand (plants/ha) = [average number plants per segment x 10,000] / [segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres) x number of rows]
Note: Researchers who use this method must check that the measuring stick does not slide out of position when they make their plant counts.
A3.2.4 Methods for Mixed Cropping in a Broadcast Planting
Use the method described for systematic quadrat sub-sampling for broadcast planting (see Section A3.2.1). When crops are mixed, the researcher must record the number of plants separately for each crop that he or she identifies in a sub-sample. A crop stand for each crop in the mixture and for the combined mixture is calculated.
Note: Mixed cropping situations happen in many on-farm trials. Volunteer watermelons, cowpeas, and other crops commonly establish in sorghum trials. In experiments controlled by the farmer, these volunteers should be left and counted. In other experiments, where agronomic data are more important, the researcher may wish to remove these plants. The researcher should not count the removed plants.
For example, if there is an average of 8,3 sorghum plants and an average of 0,9 watermelon plants per sub-sample and a quadrat sub-sample of 2m by 2m, the:
Sorghum stand (plants/ha) = (8,3 x 10,000)/(2 x 2) = 20,750 plants/ha
And the:
Watermelon stand (plants/ha) = (0,9 x 10,000)/(2 x 2) = 2,250 plants/ha
Therefore:
Intercrop stand (plants/ha) = 20,750 sorghum plants + 2,250 watermelon plants/ha.
A3.2.5 Methods for Mixed Cropping in a Row Planting (intercropping)
Use the method described for row segment measurement for row planting (see Section A3.2.3), The researcher sub-samples or counts each crop in the intercrop and records these data separately, Usually, the segment samples for one crop are paired with segment samples for the other crop. Record the proportion of intercrop rows occupied by each crop.
Stand for each crop (plants/ha) = [average number plants per segment x proportion of rows x 10,000] / [segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres)]
Stand for the intercrop (plants/ha) = ((average number plants of first crop per segment x proportion of rows) + (average number plants of second crop per segment x proportion of rows) x 10,000)/(segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres))
Take the example of a two-row sorghum to one-row cowpea intercrop. Research staff count an average of 18.4 sorghum plants per segment sample and an average of 12.6 cowpea plants per segment sample. Each segment has a length of 8 metres, The average row spacing is 0.82 metres.
The sorghum stand = (18.4 x 0.67 x 10,000)/(8 x 0,82) = 18,793 plants/ha
The cowpea stand = (12,6 x 0,33 x 10,000)/(8 x 0,82) = 6,338 plants/ha
The intercrop stand = [((18.4 x 0,67) + (12,6 x 0,33) x 10,000)] / (8,0 x 0,82) = 25,131 plants/ha
Note: The inter-crop stand equals the sorghum stand plus the cowpea stand.
A3.2.6 Percent Ground Cover as an Alternate Measurement
Percent ground cover can be used as an alternative to plant counts in some situations. It is often preferable to estimate weed growth by percent ground cover than by plant counts. This is because weed plants differ enormously in size per plant, Spreading crops such as watermelon, pumpkin, and indeterminate cowpea also might be measured as ground cover instead of plant number.
On-farm researchers in Botswana use percent ground cover to measure weed growth before ploughing, weed growth at weeding time, weed growth late in the season, and watermelon growth in a sorghum-melon mix. Researchers use two different cover-estimation methods:
* Whole Plot Method. FSD researchers estimate visually the percent of ground covered by vegetation. The estimate is from 0 percent (no ground cover) to 100 percent (when vegetation cover equals the ground area). The researcher stands at one end of the plot to make the estimate. If the plot is long, the researcher divides the length into equal parts and estimates percent cover for each division of the plot. The plot estimate is the average of all division estimates.
* Quadrat Sub-Sampling Method. The ground cover is estimated using two quadrat sub sampling methods. For each method, quadrats are used that measure 2m by 2m:
* Method 1: The quadrats remain at fixed positions in the plot. The positions represent different parts of the plot, This method is used when repeated measures of cover are needed. Because of the time and material costs of maintenance, work is usually to confined to a very few fixed quadrats (e.g., two to four per plot). Again, a visual estimate (i.e., 0 to 100 percent) of the percent of ground covered by vegetation is usually made.
* Method 2: Quadrats are placed for one measurement only. Sub-sampling is similar to that for systematic quadrat sub-sampling for broadcast planting, (Section A3.2. 1 ). The same visual estimate of the percent of ground cover is usually made.
Additional points to note are:
* Contrary to conventional wisdom, estimates of a percent cover are better than a simpler rating of cover, even if precision of the percentage seems suspect. Compare a 0 to 10 rating system with a 0 to 100 percent system. Some researchers may never differentiate better than between ratings of six or seven. Even then, nothing would be lost in using percent estimates, because true differentiation is still between 60 and 70 percent. Other researchers are able to differentiate better than between a six or seven rating particularly near the zero or 10 extremes. For these researchers, the 0 to 100 percent estimate is more precise.
* Accuracy, precision, and consistency between researchers will be improved with simple training on estimating percent ground cover. Even after training, several different staff members are asked to cross-check estimates on some of the same plots, Experience shows that a core of staff can be identified to give repeatable estimates of percent ground cover,
The following situation occurs commonly in on-farm research, Suppose there is a need to know the sorghum plant density as well as the ground cover provided by a secondary intercrop or by weeds. Using systematic quadrat sampling (see Section A3.2.1), the following were found: an average of 8,3 sorghum plants and an average watermelon plant cover (i.e., Method 2 above) of 62% per sub-sample, the:
Intercrop stand = 20,750 sorghum plants/ha, + 62% watermelon ground cover,
A3.3 Introduction to crop yield estimation
Yield is the most important direct measurement in crop experiments, In this section, methods that are used to measure crop yield in on-farm research are discussed, Over the years, these methods have been used and modified to suit the needs of work in Botswana. The methods vary, because requirements of experiments differ. Researchers should thoughtfully select the appropriate method for each experiment in their programme.
Once a method is selected, it should be used throughout the trial or experiment. This can ensure that differences in the data are a result of treatments and not of a change in research methods. If circumstances require a change, the change should take place between replications and not between treatments. Treatments in a replication must be handled in a uniform manner.
Not only methods, but personnel and equipment, cause bias in a yield measurement, if one treatment is favoured. Farmers or staff sometimes have a preferred treatment. When this happens, the data become biased and possibly invalid. Training of staff and farmers helps avoid bias caused by uneven use of measuring methods,
The researcher will choose a method for several reasons: speed, ease, cost, information needed, precision needed, nature of crop or crop mixture, and design of the trial, The researcher must also remember that yield measurement, whether by researcher or farmer, should be handled in a way that does not greatly inconvenience the farmer.
<section>m</section>
A3.4 Yield measurements of sorghum and millet plots
The method used must be appropriate for sorghum and millet trials. In contrast to trials on legumes, most sorghum and millet trials focus on production practices. A single variety with a relatively uniform maturity is planted. This means that yield usually can be measured with a single cutting. Plots for trials on tillage-planting and water conservation tend to be large, which increases the size of the harvest. The method also needs to be quick, because sorghum and millet plots tend to be numerous in on-farm research.
All sorghum and millet trials are not the same. Some consist of a large number of plots in a field, whereas others include only two or three plots, The participation of farmers is generally more in simple experiments than in those with a larger number of plots in the field.
A3.4.1 Systematic Quadrat Sub-Sampling for Sorghum and Millet
The procedure, which can be used for both broadcast and row-planted plots, can be used to make fairly accurate estimates of grain yield during a single visit by researchers to the field. This procedure is especially useful for production systems in which harvests are typically carried out in stages. This procedure is remarkably accurate in the Botswana production situation because much more of the variability in sorghum and millet grain yields is due to head numbers per hectare than to average weight per head. The procedure is as follows:
* Sub-Sampling. Sub-sample the plot with a 2m by 2m quadrat. Take 20 quadrat sub samples in a systematic pattern. Usually, this pattern consists of two passes through the plot with 10 equally spaced sub-samples. If the plot is row planted, each pass follows rows near, but not on, the border. In such a case, select rows that are one-fourth of the plot width from the border on both sides of the plot. Preferably, three people work: two carry the quadrat, and one carries the sample bags and records data. The front carrier follows a sampling line and the rear carrier counts paces. The quadrat is placed on the ground, without bias, at the toe of the rear carrier. For row planting, record the number of rows in each sub-sample and average row spacing in each plot.
* Data and Sample Collection. In each sub-sample, counts are made on the number of plants and number of grain heads. Heads are recorded as:
HR -- Heads already harvested before measurement.
MT -- Heads ready for harvest.
GR -- Heads that are green. These can reach maturity.
GZ -- Heads that are completely missing due to livestock feeding.
At this point, there are two options:
* Option 1: Harvest the MT heads and put them in large, brown kraft paper bags. Labelling includes field, plot, and quadrat number. Close and staple bags. Pack sample bags from plot in a large burlap bag.
* Option 2: Harvest the MT heads and bulk all sub-samples from the plot in a large burlap bag. This is the option now recommended.
* Drying, Threshing, and Weighing Samples. Which approach to use here is based on the options used above:
* Option 1: Oven dry or sun dry the sub-samples. For sun drying, the heads should be removed from the bag. For this option, a protected space is required, reached by the sun, in which to spread and dry the samples. Alternatively, heads may be left in the bags to dry, but the bags must be opened fully. When the samples are left in the bags, drying will take a little longer, but it reduces the danger of samples getting mixed up or lost, When samples reach a uniform threshing moisture, the heads are counted and threshed, grain weighed, and the data recorded on the harvest data sheet, A labelled bag is used to hold a sample throughout the final weighing process.
* Option 2: If the grain is wet, it is first dried, and then bulked sub-samples are threshed and weighed at the farm,
Additional points to note are:
* If a plot has been harvested already, FSD staff still can collect a sample of 30 heads that the farmer indicates came from the plot, Check carefully with the farmer about this, When the plot is harvested, a rough estimate of yield can be made by using this head sample and HR counts in the field.
* Other measurements can be combined with quadrat sampling, such as plant height, visual gauging of average height of productive plants to the base of the main panicle, etc.
* Systematic sub-sampling appears complicated, but experience has shown that research technicians and casual labourers can routinely and correctly handle the method, A training session for technicians improves the quality of sub sampling, When farmers harvest trials, sub-sampling should not be used.
* Sub-sampling is appropriate for RMRI or RMFI trials where the number of plots per field is greatest, With this method, the researcher can gather in-depth agronomic information, such as sorghum tiller numbers and head size in a RMFI manure trial, which is needed for some comparisons with station research. Sub sampling can estimate more precisely the effect of treatments than whole-plot harvest, This is because:
-- Plot size and shape are not regular. Inaccurate estimates of plot size affect whole-plot measurements, but not quadrat measurements.
-- Non-treatment causes often mask treatment effects in portions of plots. Such visible conditions as ploughing dead furrows, plot borders, water washouts, ant hills, and trees can be avoided by sub-sampling.
* Harvesting by research staff can have a negative effect on the farmer's view of the trials. To help with implementation and assessment of experimental technology, researchers should strive to pass ownership of farmer-implemented trials to farmers, Farmers gain a greater sense of ownership if they harvest their own trials,
* Calculate Yield. Grain yield estimates, tiller numbers, and head weights are most easily calculated by entering the data in dBase 3 Plus database package and using the program that is described in Norman and Siebert [1990], Alternatively, grain yield can be calculated by the following formula:
Average head weight (kg) = total weight in sample of heads taken (kg) / number of heads
Total potential grain yield (kg/ha) = (av. head weight x av. number HR heads) + (av. head weight x av. number MT heads) + (av. head weight x av. number GZ heads)
'Potential' is indicated because the GZ heads have been eaten by animals and are not available to the farmer for harvest.
Total grain yield for farmer (kg/ha) = (av. head weight x av. number HR heads) + (av. head weight x av. number MT heads)
Note: An estimate of harvest from heads that are still green can be added if the visit is relatively early and the researcher and farmer believe that the green heads will develop and be harvested at a later date,
Grain yield from green heads (kg/ha) = (av. head weight x av. number GR heads)
For example, FSD staff find several large plots in which about half of the sorghum is ready for harvest but still in the field, The farmer has harvested the earliest heads to prevent damage from wild animals. Using the systematic quadrat subsampling method (see Section A3.4.1), FSD staff count on an average of 5,8 plants/quadrat, averages of 8.5 MT heads/quadrat in the field, 2.2 HR stems/quadrat indicating heads that have been harvested, 3.7 GZ stems/quadrat showing signs of animal grazing of heads, and 5.5 GR heads/quadrat that should still mature and be harvested. The FSD staff harvests the MT heads from the subsamples and collects a sample of HR heads from the threshing floor as directed by the farmer. The MT heads weigh an average of 0.032 kg and the HR heads an average of 0.015 kg. Note that the HR head weight is used for GZ or previously grazed heads, as well. Each quadrat sub-sample is 2m by 2m,
Harvest plant stand (plants/ha.) = (5.8 x 10000)/4 = 14,500 plants/ha
The MT harvest (kg/ha) = ((8,5 x 10000)/4) x 0,032) = 680 kg./ha
The HR harvest (kg/ha) = ((2.2 x 10000)/4) x 0.015) = 83 kg/ha
The GR harvest (kg/ha) = ((5.5 x 10000)/4) x 0.032) = 440 kg/ha
The GZ harvest (kg/ha) = ((3,7 x 10000)/4) x 0.015) = 139 kg/ha
The actual harvest to the farmer (kg/ha) = MT + HR + GR = 1,203 kg/ha
If it is discovered later, for whatever reason, that the field was abandoned before the GR heads matured, the actual harvest = MT + HR = 763 kg/ha.
The harvest that was lost to uncontrolled animals = GZ = 139 kg/ha,
A3.4.2 Whole-Plot Harvest for Sorghum and Millet
* Measure Size and Shape of Plot. Re-measure at the end of the season for RMRI and RMFI trials, For FMFI trials, the researcher may decide that pegging from the beginning of the season is accurate enough.
* Row Planting. Measure average row spacing, if the plot is row planted. Average row spacing equals the width of the plot in metres divided by the number of rows in the plot.
* Plot Boundaries. Where they are not clear, plot boundaries need to be marked, In large plots, tall sighting poles help greatly in marking boundaries, In small- and intermediate sized plots, string lines can be used to mark boundaries. Because the need for precise marking is less in FMFI trials, decisions about boundaries usually can be left to the host farmer.
* Farmer Harvesting. Discuss the needs of the trial with the farmer if he/she will be harvesting alone, When research staff are helping with the harvest, discuss the schedule with the farmer, Arrange logistics, such as where the harvest from the plots will be stacked for drying, If possible, researcher or field staff should visit the field on the day when the farmer starts harvesting. At that time, they should label the harvest bags and agree on which bags will be used for each plot.
* Harvest Criteria. Instruct harvesters on the criteria for harvesting, such as whether to harvest green millet heads, heads with smut, and so on.
* Single Cutting. Usually plan to harvest a plot in a single cutting. If more than one cutting is planned, adjust the harvest criteria appropriately.
* Threshing and Weighing. After drying, thresh and weigh grain from each plot. The farmer is asked to transport the harvest of each plot to the threshing floor, thresh the grain, and put it in a labelled bag. Researchers provide the farmer with bags, Identification on the bag must be simple and clear, Research staff will schedule a visit to weigh the threshed harvest from each plot,
* Calculate Yield. This is done as follows:
Grain yield (kg/ha) = (plot yield (kg) x 10,000)/plot size in square metres,
For example, if 18 kilograms are harvested and the plot size is 10m by 25m metres, then:
Grain yield (kg/ha) = (18 kg x 10,000)/(10 metres x 25 metres) = 720 kg/ha,
Additional points to note are:
* Whole-plot harvesting is easy, inexpensive, and appropriate for FMFI trials. That is why this method is recommended when farmers harvest trials alone or together with research staff. Because farmers are helping with harvesting, a larger number of research sites can be managed, If farmers work with the harvest, they also are more likely to feel they own the trial.
* The additional work required to make the whole-plot method precise enough for some studies can be tedious, Plot size and shape must be measured accurately. Sometimes, portions of the plot affected by causes from outside the trial need to be subtracted from the plot area before calculating yield.
* This method is most suitable with small- and intermediate-sized plots, Keeping many harvest samples of large plots separate is difficult, and the chance of a mix-up increases. Using this method, the researcher cannot easily collect the data to make in-depth agronomic analyses. Information on tiller number and harvest plant stands would need separate sampling and measurement.
A3.4.3 Row-Segment Measurement for Sorghum and Millet
* Sub-Sampling. Sub-sampling and data collection are similar to those of the systematic quadrat sub-sampling method (see Section A3.4.1). The main difference is the use of a measuring stick instead of a square quadrat.
* Sample Collection. Cutting, drying, threshing, and weighing samples are the same as for Option 2 of systematic quadrat sub-sampling (see Section A3.4.1).
* Calculate Yield. Grain yield estimates can be calculated by using the following equation:
Grain yield (kg/ha) = [(sample Yield per plot (kg) x 10,000)] / [(number sub-samples x segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres)]
For example, if 2 kilograms are harvested from 20 measured segments in a plot, each segment is 2 metres long, and average row spacing is 0.75 metres then:
Grain yield (kg/ha) = (2 x 10,000)/(20 x 2 x 0.75) = 667 kg/ha.
Note the following additional points:
* Because this method is similar to the systematic quadrat sub- sampling method, most comments given in that section (Section A3.4.1) pertain here as well. Tiller number and head weights also can be calculated,
* The use of a measuring stick instead of a quadrat has three effects:
-- The stick is more manageable, so work can be done by two technicians instead of three.
-- The stick is easy to transport -- a big plus for staff travelling on bicycle or foot.
-- However, the quadrat is more decisive than the stick about defining the boundary of the sub-sample. Harvest data collected with quadrats are generally more reliable than data collected with measuring sticks.
A3.5 Yield measurements of legume plots
A3.5.1 Whole-Plot Approach
Several reasons why whole-plot harvesting is used to measure grain yield in onfarm legume trials are:
* A major part of on-farm work with cowpea, mung bean, and groundnut has been testing varieties and other crop comparisons. In these trials, plots can be distinguished readily by plant or seed type,
* Legume plots are not big; trials include only a few plots per farm and tend to be FMFI. Farmers can readily manage the whole-plot harvest of this type of trial.
* Most importantly, cowpea, mung bean, and tepary bean have an indeterminate growth habit -- at least partially -- so that more than one harvest cutting is needed. For research staff to sub-sample a plot repeatedly is not practical,
* Groundnut plots do not require repeated sampling. However, these plots are small, and grain yield is more easily measured if farmers harvest whole trial plots.
A3.5.2 Systematic Quadrat Sub-Sampling for Legume Leaf Spinach
Systematic quadrat sub-sampling is used for measuring leaf spinach yield for crops such as cowpea. The procedure is as follows:
* Sub-Sampling. The sub-sampling pattern is similar to that for sorghum and millet (see Section A3.4.1).
* Data and Sample Collection. In each sub-sample, the number of plants are counted and their leaves are harvested. Take all the leaves to measure the potential harvest. Alternatively, consult with the farmer and choose the intensity of defoliation that is typical. Bulk or combine the sub-samples from each plot.
* Prepare Spinach and Weight. Ask the farmer to prepare dried spinach and weigh.
* Option 1: Weigh the plot samples while they are still fresh. Take a small sample (0.5 kilograms) from the bulked sample, Give the rest of the bulked material to the farmer to use as he/she pleases. Ask the farmer to prepare the dried spinach from the small sample, Weigh the small samples again when ready as spinach,
* Option 2: Ask the farmer to prepare dried spinach from the bulked sample for each plot, Weigh it when it is ready.
* Calculate Yield. Depending on the option, the procedure is:
* Option 1:
Spinach weight per 100 square metres = [bulked fresh sample (kg) x (small sample dried (kg)/small sample fresh (kg)) x 100] / plot size (square metres)
For example, if 7.4 kilograms are harvested from a 20m by 10m plot. The 0.5 kilogram small sample, when prepared as spinach, weighs 0.15 kilogram, then:
Spinach weight per 100 square metres = (7.4 x 100 x (0.15/0.5))/(20 x 10) = 1.11 kg.
* Option 2:
Dried spinach weight per 100 square metres = [(prepared spinach weight (kg) x 100)] / plot size (square metres)
For example, if 0.95 kilogram spinach is prepared from leaf harvested from a 15m by 12m plot, then:
Dried spinach weight per 100 square metres = (0.95 x 100)/(15 x 12) = 0.53 kg.
Note: Because leaf sampling might affect grain yield, the researcher should either harvest leaf samples on parts of the plot where grain yield will not be measured or harvest leaf samples equally on all treatments of the legume trial. If leaf sampling is only on some treatments, the others will be favoured, and this might bias and invalidate the grain legume yield comparison of the trial.
A3.5.3 Whole-Plot Harvest for Legume Grain.
* Whole-Plot Harvest Procedure. Whole-plot harvest for legumes is similar to that for sorghum and millet where farmers harvest the grain (see Section A3.4.2).
* Cuttings. The indeterminacy of their growth will require more than one cutting to measure grain yield for cowpea, mung bean, and tepary bean. There are two approaches to dealing with cuttings:
* Option 1: Each cutting is kept separate, If the researcher wants to compare legume treatments for each cutting, the schedule of harvesting by the farmer and weighing by research staff must be organized well. To compare correctly, farmers should harvest each treatment at each cutting, even if the yield is still small.
* Option 2: The cuttings are combined, For most trials, researchers can bulk the different cuttings to get one yield per plot, Even here, farmers often would like to use part of the harvest before the final harvest has been completed. To help the farmers, research staff can organize a schedule of visits to check the harvesting procedure and weigh grain harvests to that date.
For example, a farmer makes three harvests on each plot of a trial involving cowpeas. For one plot, the harvest yields were 5.2 kg, 3.1 kg, and 0 kg. For a second plot, harvest yields were 0.1 kg, 2.2 kg, and 12.1 kg. Upon careful measurement, FSD staff found the first plot to be 12m by 15.5m and the second plot to be 10.5m by 12.0m.
Grain yield of plot one (kg/plot) = 8.3 kg/plot
When adjusted for actual plot size = (5.2 + 3.1 + 0)/(12 x 15.5) = 0.0446 kg/square metre or = 446 kg/ha
Grain yield of plot two (kg/plot) = 14.4 kg/plot
When adjusted for actual plot size = (0.1 + 2.2 + 12.1)/(10.5 x 12.0) = 1.142 kg/square metre, or= 1,142 kg/ha
A3.5.4 Whole-Plot Harvest for Groundnuts
Groundnut whole-plot harvest is similar to that for sorghum and millet, where farmers harvest the grain in one cutting (see Section A3.4.2). For groundnuts, grain yield for the shelled (i.e., shells removed) harvest is reported. A shelling percentage estimate is one of the yield quality measures for groundnut.
To obtain the groundnut shelling percentage, a small sample (e.g., 0.5 kilograms) of unshelled nuts that have been dried for shelling is weighed. Then shell and weigh the shelled sample:
Shelling percentage = (100 x weight shelled (kg)) / weight unshelled (kg)
Shelling percentage can be used to convert unshelled harvest weights to estimates of shelled weights. To get an estimate of yield when a farmer has not yet shelled his harvest: weigh the unshelled harvest, weigh a small shelling percentage sub-sample (0.5 kilograms), shell, and then reweigh the shelled sub-sample:
Shelled harvest (kg) = [unshelled harvest (kg) x shelling percentage] / 100
For example, a farmer has 22 kilograms of unshelled nuts. A 0,5 kilogram sample of unshelled nuts weighs 0.24 kilogram after shelling.
Shelling percentage = (100 x 0.24)/0.50) = 48.00
Shelled harvest (kg) = (22 x 48.00)/100 = 10.56 kg
Grain yield for all legumes is calculated in much the same way as for sorghum and millet. Because plots in legume trials are small and the whole-plot harvest method is used, estimates of yield are sensitive to errors such as overlapping treatments. Consequently, it is important to discuss the requirements of a plot trial with farmers, to inspect plots, and to measure accurately plot size and grain harvest when yield estimates are important.
Note: For groundnut, when shelled harvest weight is required, it is best to leave the bulk of the harvest in the shell and use the approach described above. This is because groundnuts tend to store better in the shell.
A3.5.5 Method for Fodder Crop Plots
Fodder yield is generally measured by systematic sub-sampling, Most fodder trials are FMFI, with only a few plots on each farm. With farmers doing the work, a whole-plot measurement would be preferred. For economic and farmer assessments, larger plots for fodder production and use studies are required. Because fodder is bulky, weighing the entire harvest will not be practical. For this reason, the systematic quadrat sub-sampling method is used. Points to note about this method are the following:
* Procedures for fodder are similar to the leaf harvest method in legumes (Section A3.5.2).
* Set the schedule for harvest measurement with the farmer, Sub-sampling must be done before the farmer harvests the remainder of the plots.
* Time the harvest for each fodder crop to coincide with the stage of growth when the nutritive value is optimal.
* Cut the sub-samples and immediately carry them to a safe point outside the plot. Sub samples from one plot can be bulked together and weighed, This is a fresh weight. Fodder yield should be reported as dry weight. Spread out the bulked harvest samples for drying. Note that the recommendation for standard fodder production is to allow cut hay to dry to some extent in place. This reduces the weight and burden in transporting. Sub-samples are not heavy and removing them to a safe drying point lowers the risk of accidental loss.
* For precise estimates of fodder dry matter yield, research staff need to weigh a harvested sample at one-week intervals beginning about two weeks after the sample is harvested. The exact beginning time is dependent on the weather conditions being conducive for drying, To manage this work, only a representative portion of each bulked sample harvested from the field is separated and weighed. This new drying sub-sample can be put in a large burlap bag and hung to dry, A label on the bag can be used to record dates and weights. Reweigh the drying sub-sample a week later, If the weight is less than that of the previous weight, the sub-sample is still drying. Repeat the weighing until each drying sub-sample weight is constant. Use the constant weight as the dry weight of fodder in the sub-sample.
* Calculate dry matter (DM) yield as follows:
Proportion dry matter = sample dry weight (kg)/sample fresh weight (kg).
Fodder (kg DM)/harvest sample = bulked sample (kg fresh) x proportion dry matter,
Plot fodder yield (kg DM/plot) = [(fodder (kg DM) x plot size (sq. metres))] / sample size (square metres)
Fodder yield per hectare (kg DM/ha) = [(plot fodder Yield (kg DM/plot) x 10,000)] / plot size (square metres)
For example, 10 quadrat sub-samples (2m x 2m) are harvested from a plot measuring 30m by 30m. The bulked fresh weight of the samples is 42 kilograms. A drying sub sample, weighing 5 kilograms, is dried to a steady weight of 1,2 kilograms,
Proportion dry matter = 1,2/5 = 0,24
Fodder (kg DM)/harvest sample = 42 x 0,24 = 10,08 kg DM/harvest sample,
Plot fodder yield (kg DM/plot) = (10.08 x (30 x 30))/(10 x 2 x 2) = 226,8 kg DM/plot
Fodder yield per hectare (kg DM/ha) = (226,8 x 10,000)/(30 x 30) = 2520 kg DM/ha
* A less precise measure of fodder yield is obtained by following the procedure above with one small change, Instead of repeatedly weighing a drying sample, allow the bulked sample to dry for a set period of six weeks or more. After this period, assume the hay is dry, return, and weigh the entire bulked sample. The weight is for the harvest sample? that is, kilograms of dry matter/harvest sample,
Note: According to research experience, fodder plots are seldom harvested at the optimal time, Researchers should be warned, if harvest is delayed much past the optimal stage, senescence and leaf drop will dramatically reduce harvest yield and harvest quality.
A3.6 Yield estimation for mixed cropping
Mixed cropping research covers a range of trials. Trials differ in the type of growth habit and type of yield that is measured. For example, in a sorghum-melon mix study, yield measurement is for grain in sorghum and for vegetative growth in watermelon, In a sorghum-cowpea intercropping trial, measurement is for grain in both crops,
Many mixed cropping trials are designed to collect relatively precise agronomic data under farm conditions. In these cases research staff will measure yield, In the sorghum-melon mix trial, researchers use a systematic quadrat sub-sampling to measure sorghum yield together with an estimate of percent ground cover to measure melon growth, In a row-planted sorghum-legume intercropping study, measurements are made on selected rows. Yields are measured in a sorghum-legume mixed cropping trial using the whole-plot harvest method for each crop separately in the mix. These mixtures are broadcast seeded,
For example, as in the yield calculation illustration given for systematic quadrat subsampling (Section A.3.4.1), the FSD team finds 8.5 MT sorghum heads/quadrat in the field, 2.2 HR head stems/quadrat, 5.5 GR heads/quadrat, and 3,7 GZ head stems/quadrat. Sorghum plant numbers average 5.8/quadrat. The quadrat is 2m by 2m. Sorghum head samples weigh 0.032 kg./head for MT heads and 0.015 kg./head for HR heads from the threshing floor, As before (Section A3.4.1) assume the weight of the GZ heads is the same as that for the HR heads. In addition, at each quadrat sub-sampling FSD staff estimate watermelon plant ground cover as well as count the number of pigweed plants (Amaranthus spp.), a particularly pernicious weed on these fields. For ten quadrat sub-samples, percent ground cover estimates for watermelon are: 0, 0, 85, 55, I 5, 0, 25, 30, 65, and 25. Pigweed plant counts in the same quadrat sub-samples are 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 9, and 0.
Sorghum plant density (plants/ha.) = 14,500 plants/ha.
The estimated actual sorghum grain crop (kg/ha) = MT + HR + GR = 1203 kg/ha.
The sorghum grain yield lost to uncontrolled animals (kg/ha) = GZ = 139 kg/ha.
The watermelon ground cover (%) = (0+0+85+55+15+0+25+30+65+25)/10 = 30%.
Pigweed plant density = (2+4+1+2+3+0+0+1+9+0)/10 = 2.2 plants/quadrat = 5,500 plants/ha.
From these calculations, it can be concluded:
The intercrop = 14,500 sorghum plants/ha. + 30% watermelon ground cover.
The intercrop yield = 1203 kg. sorghum grain/ha. + 30% watermelon ground cover.
The botanical cover = 14,500 sorghum plants/ha. + 5,500 pigweed plants/ha. + 30% watermelon ground cover
A3.7 Method for estimating whole-farm production and average grain yield
Information on crop production for the whole farm can be used to describe and diagnose needs of households and inter-season variation in production. Average grain yield for the farm gives a baseline value to compare with results of trials. The Single Interview Visit Method is used. The procedure used is as follows:
* Select farmers to be interviewed following completion of threshing,
* At an interview with the farmer -- usually about 30 minutes -- record in kilograms or volume measures the amount of each crop harvested in shelled/threshed terms.
* Ask the farmer to point out the land that he or she has cultivated this season,
* Prepare a sketch of the cultivated part of the field,
* Measure all sides of the cultivated land with a measuring wheel, If the cultivated block has an irregular shape, divide the sketch into rectangular blocks, as large as possible. Measure the sides of these blocks.
* Calculate the land area cultivated as follows:
Area cultivated (square metres) = average length (metres) x average width (metres) for block of land that is cultivated.
If the block is irregular in shape, use the average of opposite sides as the approximate average length and width.
Cultivated land (ha) = area cultivated (sq. m)/10,000
* Calculate production as follows:
Farm grain production (kg threshed/shelled) = sum of weights (kg threshed/shelled) for grain crops harvested by the farmer.
Note the following additional points:
* The above formula implies adding production of sorghum and millet and legume crops. Although this is not strictly correct to do, it is probably not so serious an error, because the bulk of the production is sorghum.
* Because farmers express production in volume units, the following conversions may be helpful:
-- Standard grain bag holds 70 kilograms of grain.
-- Standard 20 litre bucket holds 14.2 kilograms of grain.
* Calculate the yield as follows:
Grain yield (kg threshed/shelled per hectare) = farm grain production (kp threshed/shelled) / land cultivated (ha)
* Calculate the yield for one crop (crop A) as follows:
Use the production (kg threshed/shelled of crop A) of crop A from interview with farmer and identify and measure the area planted to crop A.
Yield of crop A (kg threshed/shelled crop A per hectare) = farm production of crop A (kg threshed/shelled) / land cultivated with crop A (ha)
This type of interview can be quick and surprisingly accurate. Measuring the field takes more time than the interview but does not require the farmer to be present, The interview is useful to estimate wholefarm production, not individual plot yield. The method works well in estimating grain production of sorghum and millet, legumes, and so forth, but is less accurate for melon and spinach crop yields. Researchers do not need to notify a farmer before the interview visit, but advanced notification is preferable. The interview obviously must follow completion of threshing and shelling.

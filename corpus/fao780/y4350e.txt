PREPARATIO N OF THIS DOCUMENT.
T h is checklist is part of the FAO's continuing effort to address the need for information on the occurrence of diseases and pathogens of aquatic animals in the Asia-Pacific Region. A previous checklist, published as FAO Fisheries T ech n ical Paper No. 369, has summarized the parasites of fishes of the Philippines. T h ese documents support the FAO/NACA regional strategy for the Development of Health Certification and Quarantine Guidelines for the Responsible Movement of Live Aquatic Animals in Asia, a programme involving 21 Asian nations, FAO, the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA), the Office International des Épizooties (OIE) and regional and international specialists. One of the goals identified under this strategy is the development of a comprehensive information database on aquatic animal health, the Aquatic Animal Pathogen and Quarantine Information System (AAPQIS; www.enaca.org/aapqis/). Information provided via AAPQIS and through these checklists is intended to assist aquatic animal health workers, quarantine officers and policy makers in developing national strategies to minimize the risks associated with movement of pathogens of aquatic animals, and to make informed assessments on the possible threats presented by proposed movements of individual species of live fish and shellfish between countries. Further information on the regional programme is found in the "Asia Regional T ech n ical Guidelines on Health Management of Live Aquatic Animals and the Beijing Consensus and Implementation Strategy" (FAO Fisheries T ech n ical Paper No. 402).

ABSTRACT This checklist summarizes information on the parasites of Bangladeshi fishes contained in the world literature dating from the earliest known records (Southwell and Prashad, 1918a,b) to the end of 2000. Information is presented in the form of parasite-host and host-parasite lists. Included are 147 named species of parasites (not including 20 nomina nuda), distributed among the higher taxa as follows: Protozoa - 1, Myxozoa - 1, Trematoda - 55, Monogenea - 6, Cestoda - 23, Nematoda - 40, Acanthocephala - 17, Hirudinea - 1, Branchiura - 1, Copepoda - 1 and Isopoda -.
Also included are many records of parasites not identified to species level. The Parasite-Host List is organized on a taxonomic basis and provides information for each parasite species on the environment (fresh water, brackish water, marine), the location (site of infection) in or on its host(s), the species of host(s) infected, the known geographic distribution (by administrative division) in Bangladesh, and the published sources for each host and locality record. The Host-Parasite List is organized according to the taxonomy of the hosts, and includes for each host, the English language and local (Bengali) common names, environment (fresh water, brackish water, marine), status in Bangladesh (native or exotic), and information on the known distribution in Bangladesh of the parasites. Both lists are accompanied by remarks and footnotes, as warranted, giving specific information on points of systematics, nomenclature, possible misidentifications, introductions, pathogenicity, etc. Citations are included for all references and a supplementary list of references contains other literature on Bangladeshi fish parasites. Parasite and host indices are included. The following new taxonomic combinations are made: Prosorhynchoides aspinosiensis (Bashirullah and Hafizuddin, 1971) n. comb. for Neobucephalopsis aspinosiensis Bashirullah and Hafizuddin, 1971; and Prosorhynchoides clupisomius (Bashirullah and Hafizuddin, 1976) n. comb. for Neobucephalopsis clupisomius Bashirullah and Hafizuddin, 1976. The parasite fauna of fishes of Bangladesh remains poorly known. Parasites have been reported from only 85 of the 528 species of marine and freshwater fish occurring in the waters of Bangladesh. The situation is complicated by the large number of reports that are based on apparent misidentifications, the existence of a plethora of poorly described species, and the relatedness of the Bangladeshi fish parasite fauna to that of the larger Indian subregion, which is also poorly known for many of the same reasons.

INTRO DUC TIO N.
T h e study of fish parasites in the territory of what is now known as Bangladesh has a relatively short history, dating back to a few scattered records contained in the works of T h o m as Southwell and colleagues, working at the first quarter of the 20 th Century in what was then known as British India (T h ese are summarized in the series The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma ­ see for example, Southwell 1930).1 A few reports were made during the period following the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, from the territory known as East Pakistan. However, most records date from the separation of the People's Republic of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971, and are mainly the result of the efforts of a few Bangladeshi scientists and their students (A.K.M. Bashirullah of the University of Dacca in the 1970s, and more recently, A.T .A. Ahmed and J. D'Silva of the University of Dhaka, and K.J. Chandra and M.B.R. Chowdhury of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh). In compiling this checklist, we have attempted to list only original reports appearing in the literature for each species. P r ev io us listings of the parasites of fishes of Bangladesh are those of Ahmed (1979, 1981) for all helminths, Ahmed and Ezaz ( 1 9 9 7 ) for the helminths of freshwater catfishes, and Chandra (1992b) for the Nematoda. A special problem was encountered with the papers of Ahmed (1981) and Ahmed and Ezaz (1997). Both papers included results of original research as well as information taken from the published literature. I n both cases, it was not possible to completely distinguish records based on original findings from those derived from the published work of other scientists. In cataloguing these papers, all records have been entered. In compiling this checklist, a large number the parasite taxa reported in the literature for Bangladesh were determined to.
The territory of Bangladesh encompasses most of what was then called the state of East Bengal (created by the division of Bengal in 1905 into West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (within present-day India) and East Bengal (Assam).
be species inquirendae or nomina nuda. Also, many apparent misidentifications have been made. Alt h o ugh a detailed review of each species was beyond the scope of this study, we have noted those taxa that we believe are unlikely to occur in the waters of Bangladesh, in the hope that future workers will examine these taxonomic problems more closely. T o a large extent, the many problems posed by the literature for Bangladesh are probably due to the difficulty that local scientists have in accessing scientific literature. I n many cases, scientists have apparently relied heavily on the Yamaguti volumes (Systema Helminthum) f o r species identification. New species have too often been established based on inadequate and inaccurate description, and/or insufficient material (a small number of specimens, or in dioceious forms, specimens of only one sex), often without critical comparisons with previously described taxa. As a result, although considerable effort has been expended on parasite surveys and taxonomic studies, it is still impossible to obtain an accurate picture of the parasite fauna of Bangladeshi fishes. T h is checklist must, therefore, be used with caution, both when attempting to identify parasites, and in zoogeographic analyses. W e hope that this work will form the basis for the critical taxonomic study and revision that are needed, based on collection of new, properly prepared material, which will eventually lead to a more accurate picture of the parasite fauna of the fishes of Bangladesh. Because Bangladesh is a deltic country and is subject to extensive flooding, it is possible for marine and euryhaline fishes to move far upstream, bringing with them much of their marine parasite faunas. Feedin g by freshwater carnivorous fishes on marine or anadromous fishes may result in the temporary transfer of gastro-intestinal parasites (" p seudo p ar asit ism " or accidental infection). In a number of cases, this appears to have resulted in typically marine helminth genera being reported from freshwater hosts.
In the literature dealing with the parasites of fishes of Bangladesh, there appear many incorrect spellings of parasite names, host names and species author's names, and incorrect attributions of dates of species authorship. Where erroneous spellings of parasite genus or species names have been consistently applied, these are noted using footnotes. Occasio n al typographical errors, misspellings of species authors' names, incorrect species attributions, and incorrect dates are not noted. Sim ilar ly , misspellings of host species names, with the few exceptions where these have been widely applied, have been corrected without comment using information obtained from FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2001). T h e Parasite - H o s t List is a taxonomically arranged listing of all parasites reported from the fishes of Bangladesh. T h e higher classification used is as follows: for the Protista and Myxozoa, that of Lom and Dyková (1992); for the T r em at o da, that of Gibson (1996); for the Monogenea, that of Boeger and Kritsky (1993); for the Cestoidea, that of Khalil et al. (1994); for the Nematoda, that of Anderson et al. (1974-1983) and Moravec (1998); for the Acanthocephala, that of Amin (1985, 1987); for the Copepoda and Branchiura, that of Kabata (1979, 1988); for the Isopoda, that of Rafi (1988); and for the Mollusca and Hirudinea, that used by McDonald and Margolis (1995). Ot h er valuable references include the synopses of fish nematodes of the Indian subcontinent by Soota (1983) and Sood (1989). T h e Parasite - H o s t List contains information for all parasite species reported from the fishes of Bangladesh. For each parasite, the currently recognized scie n t i f i c name , including authors and dates, and any synonyms under which original records appeared, are given. T h is is followed by the e n vi ro n m e n t in which the parasite normally completes its life cycle, indicated as fresh water (F), brackish water (B) or marine (M). As the life cycles of Bangladeshi fish parasites are for the most part unknown, this information is drawn primarily from non-Bangladeshi sources or from information on collection locality and/or.
host biology. T h e Location gives the site of infection where the parasite is normally found in or on the host. Under Hosts, the hosts are listed alphabetically by their currently recognized scientific names. In parentheses, following each host name, are given the numbers for the references (Re co rds ) reporting the parasite from the host in question. T h e distribution (Dist.) provides a summary of the reported distribution of the parasite in Bangladesh, and is given alphabetically by major administrative unit (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet Divisions), and for the Bay of Bengal.2 I n many cases, accurate information on distribution is lacking, due to imprecise collection information being provided by authors; in those cases where no information is given, the distribution is simply indicated as Bangladesh. Un less otherwise indicated by the authors(s), fishes examined for parasites that were obtained from local markets are considered to have originated from the division in which the market was located. Ho wev er , readers should be aware that fish obtained from markets in larger cities, such as Dhaka, may well have originated from other divisions or from the Bay of Bengal. Under Re co rds are given the numbered individual references containing the parasite records, each followed by detailed information on the locality (ies) (administrative divisions) to which they pertain. Under Re m a rk s are given comments on various aspects, such as synonymies, pathogenicity, life cycles, zoonotic importance and introductions. Mo r e specific notations on individual records are given as footnote s . T he Host-Parasite List is organized phylogenetically following the classification of fishes given by in the onlin e Catalog of Fishes by W.N. Eschmeyer (Eschmeyer 2001), with the genera and species within individual families arranged alphabetically. Information on the scientific and common names, status and environment.
Records for the Bay of Bengal include only those pertaining to the territorial waters of Bangladesh. There exist in the literature many other parasite records, mainly the result of work by Indian scientists, from fishes collected in other parts of the Bay of Bengal.
o f fishes was obtained from the species database of FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2001). For each host, the following information is given: the currently recognized scie n t i f i c name , including species author(s), followed by any synonyms under which original parasite records were made, the FishBase recognized English common name , the Be n g a l i common name (where available), the host's Status in Bangladesh (native or exotic), and its typical Environme n t (fresh water, brackish water, marine). T h is is followed by a listing of the parasite s reported for the host in question, arranged by higher taxon and listed alphabetically. Following each parasite name, the distribution is summarized by administrative division. Records that involve possible parasite misidentifications are indicated by a question mark preceding the parasite's name. Finally, where appropriate, Re m a rk s and footnote s are included to provide information on such topics as host taxonomy, distribution and introductions. An additional useful reference is Freshwater Fishes of Bangladesh (Rahman 1989). Under Re f e re n ce s are listed all the papers containing the records, as well as other works cited in the text. A short Supple m e n t a ry Re f e re n ce s lists some additional articles dealing with Bangladeshi fisheries parasitology but not containing any original reports. Not included in this checklist are unpublished records of fish parasites contained in the many postgr aduat e (M.Sc. and Ph.D.) theses produced in Bangladesh. A Pa ra s i t e Inde x and a Host Inde x complete the volume. T h e parasite fauna of the fishes of Bangladesh is poorly known. T o date, a total of 147 named species of parasites (not including 20 n o m in a nuda), (1 Protozoa, 1 Myxozoa, 55 T r em at o da, 6 Monogenea, 23 Cestoda, 40 Nematoda, 17 Acanthocephala, 1 Hirudinea, 1 Branchiura, 1 Copepoda and 1 Isopoda) have been reported. Co n t ain ed in this checklist are records for parasites from a total of 85 fish species. As over 500 species of fish occur in the country 3, there remain many years of.
basic systematic and survey work to be conducted before the parasite fauna of Bangladeshi fishes will be thoroughly documented. We would like to thank a number of colleagues who kindly provided critical comments on sections of the manuscript, key references, and/or taxonomic advice. T h ese include T .E. McDonald (Monogenea, Isopoda), D.I. Gibson and R.A. Bray (T r em at o da) , J.S. Mackiewicz (Caryophyllidae), J.N. Caira (T et r ap h y llidea) , I. Beveridge (T r y p an o r h y n ch a) and F. Moravec (Nematoda). T h e assistance of Drs R.P. Subasinghe, S.E. McGladdery, D.J. Marcogliese, D.I. Gibson and K.J. Chandra in obtaining essential literature is gratefully acknowledged. W e especially thank Dr. R.P. Subasinghe (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome), for arranging publication of this volume. J. Richard Arthur Sparwood, Canada Abu T web A.

Fr oe se and Pauly (2001) list a total of 517 fish species for Bangladesh (304 marine, 200 fresh water, and 13 listed in both.
categories); in compiling this checklist, records for an additional 11 species were encountered, bringing the total number to at least 528 species.

Remarks: The taxonomic history and host and geographic range of Lecithocladium excisum were reviewed by Gibson and Bray (1986), who concluded that its confirmed distribution was the Mediterranean and Black seas and the Northeast Atlantic region. As these authors doubted the occurrence of L. excisum in the Indian Ocean, this report from a marine fish of the Bay of Bengal requires substantiation. The life cycle in the Northeast Atlantic was studied by Køie (1991). Cercariae found in naturally infected gastropods (Philine aperta).
were used to experimentally infect various genera of marine copepods. Ctenophores and polychaetes naturally infected with metacercariae were considered likely to act as transport hosts. Adults occur in the stomach of mackerel (Scomber scomberus, S. japonicus) and immature specimens in Trachurus trachurus (see Gibson and Bray 1986).

(1972a) and Chandra and Banerjee (1993a). Adults are found in the swimbladder of siluriform catfishes, with metacercariae occurring in the muscles of many siluriform and nonsiluriform fishes. Immature flukes are found in the body cavity of Wallago attu and occasionally Channa punctata; Isoparorchis hypselobagri thus appears to use piscivorous fishes as paratenic hosts. Although Bashirullah (1972a) postulated that the parasite also matures in fish-eating mammals, including man, Chandra (1993a) pointed out that these findings are probably cases of pseudoparasitism.

Members of the genus Psilostomum are mainly parasites of aquatic birds; however, one species, P. chilkai Chatterji, 1958, (syn. of Staffordiella chilkai according to Mehra (1966)) has been described from the intestine of a fish (Lates calcarifer) in India. The above record may be based on a metacercaria or an accidental infection (a metacercaria liberated in the intestine of a piscivorous fish).
Estuarine fishes examined by Chandra (1992a) were noted to have been collected mostly from Cox's Bazar, Chittagong a nd Taknaf [Teknaf], which are all in the Chittagong Division. 17 The record of Chandra (1992a) was given as "Himiurid [sic] (unidentified)." 18 The species name was misspelled "hypselobagrii" by Chowdhury et al.

In a more complete report of their study , they subsequently (Zamin et al. 1992b) recorded a single specimen from the intestine of this fish, variously referring to it as Diphyllobothrium sp., "Diphy llobothr ide a n" and "Diphy llobothr ide a ns spp." 61 Southwell (1930) listed this species from "Khulna, Bengal, India.".
Eustrongylides tubifex (Nitzsch in (F) Rudolphi, 1819) Jägerskiöld, 1909 larva Location: ovary, mesenteries Host: Ompok bimaculatus Dist.: Dhaka Records: Khanum et al. 1996 (Dhaka); Ahmed and Ezaz 1997 (-) Remarks: The life cycle of this nematode involves maturation in fish-eating birds (Gaviiformes, Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes and Podicipediformes). Aquatic oligochaetes serve as first intermediate hosts, while fish are believed to act as second intermediate or paratenic hosts (see Moravec 1998). Moravec (1998) cautioned that the only reliable means of determining the specific identity of larval.
A listing of the nematodes recorded from fishes of Bangladesh was given by Chandra (1992b). This paper contains no original records.
Eustrongylides is to examine adult specimens obtained through experimental infection of birds. Further, as Measures (1988), in her revision of the genus, stated that E. tubifex is found only in the Holarctic and Neotropical regions, the above report is regarded as a probable misidentification.
Eustrongylides sp. [larva?] (F) Host: Ompok pabda Location: intestine [?] Dist.: Dhaka Record: Chandra 1993b Remarks: The above record from the intestine of a freshwater fish requires confirmation. The location may have been incorrectly determined, or the parasite may have been misidentified.

Records: Bashirullah 1973a (Dhaka &/or Sylhet); Ahmed 1981 (-) Remarks: Petter and Quentin (1976) noted that the genus Cosmoxynemoides Travassos, 1949 was of doubtful status because males were unknown. However, Moravec (1998), in his review of the nematode fauna of Neotropical freshwater fishes, accepted the validity of this genus and species. Moravec (1998) also noted that the genus contains a single species, C. aguirrei Travassos, 1949, so far known only from South America.

Bashirullah (1973a) inadvertently created the nomen nudum "Procamallanus cancilis Bashirullah, 1973" (as "Procamallanus cancilus Bashirullah and Hafizuddin, 1973"). 80 The species name was misspelled "heteropneustes" by Ahmed and Ezaz (1997). 81 In an apparent lapsus for Procamallanus heteropneustus, the combination "Camallanus he te ropne ustus" appears in the abstract accompany ing the paper by Zaman et al. (1992a).
Ahmed and Ezaz (1997), in an apparent error, listed a record from Ompok bimaculatus as S. heteropneustes [sic]. 83 The record of Rahman and Ali (1968) involves a tentative parasite identification. 84 The species name was misspelled "olsenia" by Bashirullah (1973a), Ahmed and Sanaullah (1976, 1977a), Ahmed (1981), Islam et al.

The life cycle was studied (under the synonym Spirocamallanus intestinecolas) by Bashirullah and Ahmed (1976b), who established experimental infections that developed to third-stage larvae in the copepods Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops crassus by exposing them to first-stage larvae released from adult worms obtained from Mystus, and by De (1995) (under the synonym S. mysti), who sucessfully infected the fish Mystus vittatus via expermental transmission of third-stage larvae in experimentally infected copepods. Following De and Moravec (1980), Procamallanus viviparus of Khan and Yaseen, 1969 is tentatively referred to P. spiculogubernaculus Agarwal, 1958.

The same material was later apparently described as P. sprenti by Bashirullah and Hafizuddin (1974) (see De and Moravec 1980). According to De and Moravec (1980), since the specimens reported as Procamallanus viviparus by Khan and Yaseen (1969) possess a smooth buccal capsule, without any thickenings, they probably belong to P. spiculogubernaculus.

Definitive hosts are typically piscivorous mammals (mainly felids, canids and mustelids), including domestic dogs and cats, in which the adult parasite occurs in swellings of the stomach. Intermediate hosts include various species of freshwater copepods, where development to third-stage larvae occurs. Fish, amphibians and other animals that ingest infected copepods may become paratenic hosts, the larvae becoming encapsulated in the musculature and visceral organs. This nematode is the cause of gnathostomosis, a serious disease of man.

BLURB This checklist summarizes information on the parasites of Bangladeshi fishes contained in the world literature dating from the earliest known records to the end of 2000. Information is presented in the form of parasite-host and host-parasite lists. Included are 147 named species of parasites. Also included are many records of parasites not identified to species level. The Parasite-Host List is organized on a taxonomic basis and provides information for each parasite species on the environment (fresh water, brackish water, marine), the location (site of infection) in or on its host(s), the species of host(s) infected, the known geographic distribution (by administrative division) in Bangladesh, and the published sources for each host and locality record. The parasite fauna of fishes of Bangladesh remains poorly known. Parasites have been reported from only 85 of the 528 species of marine and freshwater fish occurring in the waters of Bangladesh. The situation is complicated by the large number of reports that are based on apparent misidentifications, the existence of a plethora of poorly described species, and the relatedness of the Bangladeshi fish parasite fauna to that of the larger Indian subregion, which is also poorly known for many of the same reasons.

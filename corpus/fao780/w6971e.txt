REPORT OF THE CCP CONSULTATIVE SUB-COMMITTEE ON SURPLUS DISPOSAL (CSSD) (RELAYED TO THE COUNCIL AT THE REQUEST OF THE CCP) ^4
7. The Council considered and endorsed the Report of the 36th Session of the CCP Consultative Sub-Committee on Surplus Disposal (CSSD). Some members confirmed their endorsement of the Report while reiterating their concern at the exemption from prior consultation procedures of bilateral transactions through the World Food Programme (WFP) and monetary grants where the commodity was purchased from a low-income, food-deficit country (LIFDC). The Council emphasized the importance of the CSSD monitoring all the transactions set out in the new Register of Transactions. With reference to the issue of the location of the CSSD Secretariat, which had been raised at the CCP meeting in February 1997, some members reiterated their request to the FAO Secretariat for a report.
8. The Council adopted the following Resolution, which modified the Procedures contained in the Annex to Council Resolution 1/53:
Resolution 1/113
Consultative Obligations of Member Nations under FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal
THE COUNCIL,
Noting that the Consultative Sub-committee on Surplus Disposal (CSSD), a subsidiary body of the Committee on Commodity Problems (CCP), was established by the FAO in 1954 to monitor international shipments of surplus agricultural commodities used as food aid in order to minimize the harmful impact of these shipments on commercial trade and agricultural production,
Recalling the Annex to Council Resolution 1/53 (October 1969) containing procedures for notifications and consultation on food aid transactions under the Principles of surplus disposal and including the Catalogue of Transactions^ 5,
Considering that the CCP at its Sixtieth Session (April 1995) had welcomed the incorporation of the Principles in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture and had urged the Sub-committee to undertake a review of the Principles, focusing in particular on the Catalogue of Transactions, including the "grey area" transactions,
Considering that the CCP at its Sixty-First Session in February 1997 recommended that the CSSD further consider its report which should be presented to the Bureau for review and subsequently relayed by the Bureau to the FAO Council for decision, and that the report of the CCP containing this recommendation was endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997:
1. Endorses the recommendations of the CSSD, for a revision of the Procedures contained in the Annex to Resolution 1/53, including the change of the term Catalogue of Transactions to Register of Transactions, as set out in the Annex to this Resolution;
2. Requests the Director-General
(a) to transmit to Member Nations and Associate Members the text of the present Resolution and the annexed recommendations and to invite them to signify their readiness to follow the agreed procedures, and
(b) to draw the attention of Member Nations and Associate Members to the benefits to be derived from the widest possible participation of Governments in the activities of the CSSD.
Rome, 6 November 1997
Annex to Resolution 1/113
PROCEDURES FOR NOTIFICATIONS AND CONSULTATION UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF SURPLUS DISPOSAL RECOMMENDED BY FAO
The following procedures for notification and consultation are applicable to transactions of the types mentioned in the Register of Transactions reproduced below.
Notification and Consultation
(1) All reporting and consultative obligations and procedures shall be based on the principle of reciprocity among Member Nations and Associate Members.
(2) Before carrying out any transaction in agricultural commodities^6 of a type mentioned in the Register of Transactions, and taking into account the special situations covered in paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), below, the supplying country shall:
(a) undertake bilateral consultations with countries substantially interested by reason of their exports of the commodity concerned to the recipient country;
(b) notify the CSSD of the main features of the proposed transaction in order to provide other countries directly interested in exports of the commodity an opportunity for bilateral consultations, it being understood that this would not result in any lengthening of the total period of consultation.
(3) The above procedures shall not apply to:
(a) Transactions effected through intergovernmental organizations (including WFP) whose commodity transfers are already subject to special consultative rules or through intergovernmental organizations (including UNICEF and UNRWA) whose operations are of such a nature and volume as not to constitute a substantial danger of harmful interference with normal patterns of production and international trade. In such cases, donor countries shall notify the CSSD ex post facto as soon as practicable.
(b) Emergency transactions. In such cases, donor countries shall notify the CSSD ex post facto.
(c) Monetary grants as set out in category 4 in the Register of Transactions where the commodity is purchased locally or from a low-income food-deficit country (LIFDC) as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization. In such cases, donor countries shall notify the CSSD ex post facto.
(4) Transactions of relatively small size (as defined below) which are not likely to result in harmful interference with normal patterns of production and international trade shall be notified to the CSSD ex post facto as soon as practicable. Relatively small size levels are defined as follows: for wheat and other cereals, a quantity not over 10,000 tonnes; for rice, a quantity not over 1,000 tonnes; for dry skim milk, a quantity not over 400 tonnes, and for butteroil, a quantity not over 200 tonnes. These are aggregate quantities for one donor to a single recipient country during a 12-month period.
(5) FAO Member Nations which effect transactions through private charitable institutions shall periodically notify the members of CSSD using the CSSD distribution machinery in a reasonably comprehensive form, of the relevant data on the current pattern of programmes and projects, so that a Member Nation which considers its commercial trade endangered may request bilateral consultation.
Modifications to the List of Transactions and to the Register of Transactions
(6) There was general agreement that the lists of transactions were not exclusive and that some new types of transactions might be identified in the future. The Committee considered that the CSSD should be prepared to examine proposals by Member Nations for additions to or deletions from the List of Transactions^7 and modifications to the Register of Transactions. If the CSSD, after taking account of arrangements in other international organizations, concluded that the type of transaction concerned fell within the scope of the FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal, it could request the CCP to decide whether it should be added to the categories of transactions subject to consultations and/or reporting.
Position of developing countries
(7) The Committee reaffirmed that, as agreed by the Council at its Twenty-Ninth Session, the governments of recipient countries continued to be under no obligation to take steps for prior consultation or reporting. The Committee agreed that, in keeping with the spirit of the FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal and Guiding Lines, the recommended procedures for consultations and reporting should not constitute an obstacle to, or cause undue delay in, the provision of food aid which was urgently required by a developing deficit country.
(8) The Committee agreed that special consideration should be given to the interests of developing exporting countries which depended heavily on export earnings from agricultural commodities. It also agreed that special consideration should be given to the safeguarding of local production and markets of developing countries.
Obligations of Member Nations in Other Organizations or under International Agreements
(9) The Committee recognized that in relation to the transactions it had identified, Member Nations may also have incurred obligations in other organizations and under international agreements, and that nothing recommended above in any way diminished these obligations or commitments. Likewise, nothing recommended above detracted from the generality of the FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal.
Register of Transactions ^8
1. Donations of domestically-produced commodities from a government to a government of an importing country, an intergovernmental organization^9 or a private institution for free distribution directly to the final consumers in the importing country.
3. Monetary grants by the government of an exporting country to an importing country, for the specific purpose of purchasing a commodity from the exporting country.
4. Monetary grants by a government either to a supplying country (or countries) or to a recipient country for the specific purpose of purchasing a commodity from an exporting country (or countries) or from local suppliers in the recipient country for delivery to/in the specific recipient country.

Sales^10 on credit in which, as a result of government intervention, or of a centralized marketing scheme, the interest rates, period of repayment (including periods of grace) or other related terms do not conform to the commercial rates, periods or terms prevailing in the world market. In particular with respect to period of repayment, credit transactions are distinguished as follows: (a) 10 years or more; (b) over 3 years and under 10 years.
11. Sales^11 in which the funds for the purchase of commodities are obtained under a loan from the government of an exporting country tied to the purchase of those commodities, distinguished as follows with respect to period of repayment: (a) 10 years or more; (b) over 3 years and under 10 years.

NEGOTIATION OF A LEGALLY BINDING INSTRUMENT ON PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT (PIC) ^12
9. The Council welcomed the progress made by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC).
10. The Council noted that the functions of the interim Secretariat and the Convention Secretariat are expected to result in additional financial obligations.
11. The Council requested that an estimate of additional financial requirement for the Interim Secretariat be made available to the Conference. The Council recommended that the Conference, subject to an agreement on the additional financial requirements:
* Authorize the participation of the FAO Secretariat in an Interim Secretariat and in a Secretariat to the Convention if so desired during the negotiations and adopted by the Diplomatic Conference, provided that such arrangements were satisfactory to the Director-General.
* Agree to accept changes in the voluntary PIC procedure, if so decided by the Diplomatic Conference.
DESERT LOCUST SITUATION: MEASURES TAKEN AND FURTHER ACTION REQUIRED ^13
12. The Council noted the relatively calm Desert Locust situation but recommended to the Conference that locust-affected countries, supported by donors, maintain a high level of vigilance in the Western (West and Northwest Africa), Eastern (South-West Asia), and the Central Region (the Red Sea countries), especially where active locust populations still remained. In this context, the Council called on locust-affected countries to continue the process of sustaining and strengthening their locust survey and control teams as the fundamental element of successful preventive locust control.
13. The Council expressed its satisfaction at the progress made in establishing the EMPRES (Desert Locust) Programme in the Central Region, and in formulating an extension of the Programme to the Western Region (West and North-West Africa). The Council recommended that the Conference call on the international community and the locust-affected countries to continue to support the on-going Central Region Programme, and to urgently extend this support to the implementation phase of the Western Region.
14. The Council recommended to the Conference that the locust-affected countries be requested to re-evaluate existing regional locust control structures, in order to achieve an appropriate geographical coverage and to calculate in a realistic manner the financial resources that will be necessary to assist Member Nations to take common action.
15. In commenting on the Desert Locust Situation document, the Council took note of the progress already made in the development of products used at a very low concentration and the Council recommended to the Conference that emphasis be given to further research on, and to implementing the use of, alternatives to chemical pesticides which would minimize the negative effects of locust control on the environment. Research, especially within EMPRES, should also cover strategy development as part of the effort to strengthen national capacities and increased sustainability of locust control efforts.
PROGRAMME AGAINST AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS ^14
16. The Council endorsed the objective and structure for the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT) in recognition of the considerable impact of trypanosomiasis on animal production and food security, and for its potential to contribute to the objectives of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.
17. The Council noted the changes proposed in the reduction of the Statutory Bodies from three, namely the Commission on African Animal Trypanosomiasis and the two Panels of Experts on Ecological, Technical and Development Aspects, to a single body under the title of "the Panel of Advisory Group Coordinators". The establishment of this body should follow normal FAO procedures.
18. The Council strongly expressed its concern that the proposal had not first been submitted for the consideration of the technical bodies, namely the Committee on Agriculture (COAG), but nevertheless agreed that due to the importance of subject to food security it should be forwarded to Conference and not be delayed for a further two years.
19. The Council agreed that the draft resolution pertaining to the establishment of PAAT be forwarded to the Conference for consideration. It noted, however, that the establishment of PAAT would not involve additional Regular Programme resources beyond those allocated in the Programme of Work and Budget 1998-99.
20. The Council accordingly forwarded the following draft Resolution for consideration by the Conference:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
The Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT)
THE CONFERENCE,
Recognizing the severity of the impact of tsetse and trypanosomiasis on livestock, agriculture and human welfare in Africa,
Well aware that the disease has direct implications in attaining the objectives of the World Food Summit Plan of Action,
Welcoming FAO's initiative to secure international collaboration and coordination through the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT):
1.Urges all Member Nations affected by the disease to reinforce their efforts to combat the disease and to coordinate their actions through PAAT and the Joint FAO/WHO/OAU/IAEA Secretariat to this Programme.
2.Requests the Director-General:
i) to further define and pursue how the potential offered by PAAT may contribute to the broader objectives of Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD);
ii) to consolidate international action in trypanosomiasis control by formalizing, through an exchange of letters, the collaborative links required with WHO, IAEA, and OAU in order to effectively establish the Joint PAAT secretariat;
iii) to give formal recognition, within FAO, to the PAAT Programme Committee;
iv) to afford PAAT the priority, and profile warranted by its potential to contribute to the aims of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;
v) to abolish the two existing Statutory Bodies "The Panels of Experts on Ecological, and Technical Aspects and on Development Aspects to the Programme for the Control of African Trypanosomiasis and Related Development"and replace by the single Statutory Body, namely the "Panel of PAAT Advisory Group Coordinators"and to facilitate annual meetings;
vi) to abolish the Commission on African Animal Trypanosomiasis based on the consideration that the subject may be discussed, on an as required basis, by the FAO Regional Conference for Africa.
PROGRAMME, BUDGETARY, FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
PROGRAMME OF WORK AND BUDGET 1998-99^15
21. The Council examined the Programme of Work and Budget (PWB) proposals addressing in particular the two main scenarios illustrated in the document. It noted that these scenarios corresponded to zero real growth (ZRG) and zero nominal growth (ZNG), which had been prepared in accordance with its request at its last session. Although some members would have preferred more information on the impact of the ZNG scenario, the Council welcomed the extensive information provided in the document, reflecting its own directives and the advice of the Programme and Finance Committees. The Council recognized the desirability of a more concise format in the future. It welcomed the detailed review of the proposals carried out by the Programme and Finance Committees.
22. The Council noted with appreciation that the PWB proposals had taken into account the views expressed by its Technical Committees. It also welcomed the attention given to maintaining an adequate balance between normative and operational activities. In this connection, the Council recalled their complementarity and the expectations of the membership that both be continued and strengthened.
23. The Council recognized that the proposals incorporated the impact of the exchange rate, as it had also requested at its last session, based on the use of a provisional rate of Lire 1690 to US$ 1. It noted that this provisional rate was very close to current rates.
24. The Council was informed that recently-revised estimates of staff redeployment and separation costs associated with post reductions led to unbudgeted costs of approximately US$ 4 million and US$ 12 million under ZRG and ZNG, respectively.
25. Some members stated that a further reduction in administrative costs and maximization of efficiencies was essential to limit cutbacks in technical and economic programmes, and provided some suggestions in this regard. Other members stressed the substantial savings already achieved in the recent past and the need for consolidation of these gains at the present juncture, before considering further changes in organizational structure.
26. Bearing in mind the discussion to be held in Commission II of the Conference in the following week, members provided their views on the substantive contents of the proposals and the various options under consideration, also reflecting positions of regional groups.
27. Most members reiterated their preference for real growth, in the light of the extensive requirements for assistance in countries. They also emphasized the objectives agreed at the World Food Summit which called for active support from FAO. In this context, they accepted the zero real growth option as the minimum necessary for FAO to be able to fulfil its mandate. They objected to the substantial reduction of outputs involved in the ZNG scenario.
28. Other members aimed at a budget level which may allow for some flexibility on the budget for technical and economic programmes on the condition of further reductions in non-substantive programmes, such as administrative costs.
29. Still other members felt that the ZNG scenario would preserve FAO's substantive capacity to implement an effective Programme of Work which met identified priorities. They considered that under this scenario the budget was more likely to be fully funded and that a ZNG budget would be fully consistent with current pressures to contain public expenditures in many countries. In agreeing with these views, one member of this group noted that it would prefer ZNG or below scenario.
30. One member recalled its government's position that the budget level should be between US$ 610 and US$ 615 million.
31. Another member stressed its specific interest in reinstating the work on the World Apparel Fibre Consumption Survey, which had been previously discontinued.
32. In conclusion, the Council recalled the unanimous desire to avoid the difficulties experienced at the last Conference. Given the range of positions still prevailing among the membership, it urged further efforts to seek consensus on the budget level.
33. The Council, noting that as of 3 November 1997 there were 79 Member Nations who had made no payment on their 1997 assessed contributions and that 75 members were with arrears of contributions, also reiterated the importance of all members meeting their financial obligations to the Organization and settling their contributions due in time, as well as arrears.
34. The Council stressed the need for members to strengthen their sense of belonging to the Organization.
REPORT OF THE JOINT MEETING OF THE PROGRAMME AND FINANCE COMMITTEES (ROME, SEPTEMBER 1997) ^16
Programme Budget and Medium-term Planning Process ^17
35. In noting the positive reactions of the Joint Meeting to the proposals for a revised programme budget process, the Council decided to address the matter more fully under Agenda Item 10, in view of the more detailed examination of the proposals by the Programme Committee.
Savings and Efficiencies in Governance: Review of FAO Statutory Bodies ^18
36. The Council expressed its appreciation for the report of the Ad-Hoc Contact Group on Statutory Bodies which had been set up by the Programme and Finance Committees. The Council recognized that the Report aimed at achieving greater efficiencies, as requested by the Council. The Council also took note of the comments made during the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees (document CL 113/2, paras 26-31).
37. The Council reviewed the Draft Resolution for the Conference proposed by the Ad Hoc Contact Group, as well as some specific recommendations concerning Statutory Bodies and their Subsidiary Bodies. In responding to the concerns about specific recommendations contained in the Report, the Council emphasized that the authority to abolish or modify the terms of reference of Subsidiary Bodies of Statutory Bodies rested with the Statutory Body. In this connection, the Council amended the Draft Resolution for the Conference and recommended that its wording should be carefully examined by the Conference before its approval in order to avoid any possible misunderstandings.
38. The Council decided to transmit the following Draft Resolution to the Conference for its consideration:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
Review of FAO Statutory Bodies
THE CONFERENCE,
Conscious of the continuing need to enhance the efficiency of the Organization and its governance in a time of financial challenge, to eliminate Statutory Bodies that are obsolete, to ensure more flexible task-oriented and time-bound working arrangements for those that remain and to limit the creation of new bodies to those that are strictly necessary,
Recognising the importance of moving towards increased self-financing for Statutory Bodies that have regional focus, and of enhancing the responsiveness of those bodies to the needs of their members:
1. Decides to abolish the bodies listed in Annex A to this Resolution;
2. Recommends to the parent bodies concerned that their Subsidiary Bodies listed in Annex B be abolished and calls on those parent bodies to take the necessary action unless they consider, taking into account the financial and programme implications, that there are overriding reasons for retaining any such bodies in existence and to report to the Council through the Programme and Finance Committees on the actions taken and, where appropriate, on the reasons for retaining any of the Subsidiary Bodies recommended for abolition;
3. Requests the Director-General to consult with the organizations listed in Annex C with a view to securing alternative arrangements for, or the abolition of, the joint bodies listed in that Annex as deemed appropriate, and authorises their abolition, as appropriate;
4. Recommends to the Codex Alimentarius Commission that it continue its review of the usefulness of its Subsidiary Bodies set out in Annex D;
5. Encourages regional commissions established under Article VI of the Constitution to seek more extra-budgetary resources to supplement the resources made available to them under the FAO Regular Programme Budget, taking into account the economic capacity of the regions concerned and of their members;
6. Calls on the Contracting Parties to conventions and agreements establishing regional bodies under Article XIV of the Constitution to seek where appropriate, increasingly to provide such bodies with their own financial resources, whether through cooperative programmes or other voluntary contributions, or through the establishment of autonomous budgets financed from mandatory contributions;
7. Decides that in future, Statutory Bodies should be established only where strictly necessary and where the work to be undertaken cannot be carried out by ad-hoc groups, and that the terms of reference of all new bodies created should provide for a periodic review of their usefulness;
8. Further decides that, to this end, the following factors should be taken into account in establishing new technical bodies and in the establishment of new Subsidiary Bodies:
* Centrality to the FAO mandate and the Organization's current priorities as expressed by FAO members and reflected in planning documents;
* Clarity of the definition of the task, which should normally be of limited duration;
* Positive impact of the body's work at the level of FAO members;
* FAO's comparative advantage, hereby avoiding over-lap and creating synergy with the work of other bodies;
* Proportion of the FAO membership to which the work of the proposed body is of importance with due regard to the economic capacity of less advantaged members, including least developed countries and small island developing states;
* Willingness of their members to contribute financially and through non- monetary inputs to the work of the body, especially where the body will serve a more limited number of countries, with due regard to the economic capacity of their less advantaged members and the availability of other financial support;
9. Requests all Statutory Bodies to examine how their rules of procedure and working methods could be streamlined to facilitate positive inter-action among participants at meetings, to promote a task-orientation and to strengthen the involvement of civil-society partners;
10. Further requests the Secretariat to prepare information notes to facilitate review by the Council, following discussion in the Programme and Finance Committees, of a) possibilities for streamlining procedures and avoiding repetitious discussion in bodies at various levels, taking full account of the experience of other international organizations; and b) modalities for greater civil society involvement;
11. Decides that, in general, Executive Committees should cease to be listed as formal Statutory Bodies in the Directory of FAO Statutory Bodies, except for the Executive Committee of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

Other Matters Arising out of the Report ^19
39. The Council noted that the Committees had considered a concluding report with respect to the Management Review to determine the appropriate staffing levels and staffing structure of the Organization, following on earlier progress reports received at previous sessions.
40. The Council welcomed the fact that two important actions had been completed and reported upon in this last report, i.e.:
* the review of the AF Department; and
* the Grade Structure Review.
41. The Council appreciated that these two reviews had drawn on external advice. It noted that the implementation of the results of the review of the AF Department was still under way, pending policy decisions on some organizational aspects, which would include completion of the relevant organigrammes.
42. In connection with the second review, the Council concurred particularly with the recommendation of the Committees to recognize the importance of sound human resource development policies in the Organization, including aspects such as staff development and career management.
REPORT OF THE SEVENTY-EIGHTH SESSION OF THE PROGRAMME COMMITTEE
(ROME, SEPTEMBER 1997) ^20
43. The Council noted that besides consideration of the Programme of Work and Budget for 1998-99, the Programme Committee had discussed proposals aimed at revising the approach to the programme budget process, including formulation of a long-term Strategic Framework and consequently modified Medium-Term Plan and Programme of Work and Budget. It welcomed these proposals and endorsed the related conclusions of the Programme Committee.
44. The Council agreed that flexibility would be required in the implementation of the proposed changes. It recognized the importance of thorough preparation of the Strategic Framework, and of having an intense process for its formulation and development involving all stakeholders.
45. The Council also recognized that the full-scale application of the revised process required formal action to amend the pertinent sections in the Basic Texts of the Organization. Immediate action was on the agenda of the Twenty-ninth Session of the Conference for the abolition of the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees in Conference years and of the Outline Programme of Work and Budget, based on the advice of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters (CCLM) (under Conference Agenda Item 12). More comprehensive formal action would need to await progress in the transition phase.
46. The Council took note that the Programme Committee had also recommended a number of topics for possible coverage in the next Programme Evaluation Report and had addressed several Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) reports.
REPORT OF THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH SESSION OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE
(ROME, SEPTEMBER 1997)
47. The Council reviewed the report of the last session of the Finance Committee. It considered portions of the report concerning the Financial Position of the Organisation, the Scale of Assessments 1998-99, the Incentive Scheme to Encourage Prompt Payment of Contributions, the Appointment of the External Auditor, the Harmonisation of Support Costs for TCP and SPFS and Other Matters Arising Out of the Report.
Financial Position of the Organization ^21
48. The Council noted the financial position of the Organisation and urged contributors to make the maximum efforts possible to pay their 1997 contributions and thereby avoid the need for the Organisation to resort to borrowing.
Update on the UN Scale of Assessment re. Scale of FAO Contributions 1998-99 ^22
49. One member requested that the contributions due to FAO in 1998-99 from Member Nations should reflect changes in the UN Scale of Assessments as may be agreed by the 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). However, the majority of members expressed their preference to continue with the past arrangements whereby the FAO Scale of Contributions had been derived from the UN Scale of Assessments in force during the Conference year. The Council therefore decided to submit the matter to the Conference for decision.
Incentive Scheme to Encourage Prompt Payment of Contributions ^23
50. Members were unable to agree on the proposal of the Director-General, endorsed by the Finance Committee to refine the basis of the calculation of the discount to be applied for the prompt payment of contributions. The Council therefore decided to submit the matter for the Conference's decision.
Appointment of the External Auditor ^24
51. The Council approved the appointment of the Cour des Comptes of France as External Auditor for the four-year period, commencing with the audit of the 1998-99 biennium and adopted the following Resolution:
Resolution 2/113
Appointment of the External Auditor
THE COUNCIL,
Noting that the Finance Committee recommends the appointment of the Cour des Comptes of France as External Auditor of the Organization,
Recognizing the need and importance of the function of the External Auditor to review and certify the accounts of the Organisation:
Decides to appoint the Cour des Comptes of France as External Auditor of the Organization for a period of four years, commencing with the year 1998.
Rome, 6 November 1997
52. The Council endorsed the conclusions concerning future arrangements for external audit matters in paragraph 47 of the report, and expressed the hope that the Cour des Comptes would reduce its audit fees and related costs, as urged by the Finance Commitee in paragraph 46(b) of the report.
Harmonization of Support Costs for TCP and SPFS (Special Programme for Food Security) ^25
53. The Council reviewed the recommendation of the Eighty-eighth Session of the Finance Committee contained in document CL 113/4 for the harmonization of support cost charges to Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) and Regular Programme-funded SPFS, projects which had emanated from the recommendations of the External Auditor, and agreed that:
a. Direct Operating Costs
* like TCP, Regular Programme-funded SPFS projects should be charged for a reasonable estimate of the cost of the operational services provided to the projects;
* in the interests of harmonization, the rate should be the same for TCP and Regular Programme-funded SPFS; and
* the rate should be based upon the direct cost of operating units expressed as a percentage of the project inputs which they are responsible for delivering.
b. Technical Support Services
* technical support services should, in principle, be based on the direct cost of the services provided;
* appropriate methods of estimation could be used (e.g. the work-points approach); and
* the same procedures should be applied to TCP and SPFS although some variations would be necessary to take account of the differences between the two programmes (i.e. duration, nature of the projects, etc.).
Other Matters Arising Out of the Report ^26
54. The Council deferred its consideration of the Reformulation of Financial Regulation 6.9 and 7.1 contained in paragraph 39 of the report, noting that changes to the Financial Regulations would be dealt with under another agenda item.
55. The Council expressed its disagreement with the suggestion concerning the Working Methods of the Finance Committee contained in paragraphs 65 and 66 of the report to the effect that members of the Finance Committee should be elected for a four-year term.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MATTERS
REPORT OF THE SIXTY-SEVENTH SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MATTERS (ROME, 7-8 OCTOBER 1997)
56. The Council considered and adopted the Report of the Sixty-seventh Session of the CCLM.
Amendments to the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) ^27
57. The Council approved the recommendations of the CCLM and agreed to transmit the amendments to the IPPC, as modified by the CCLM (Appendix D), to the Conference for its consideration and approval.
58. The Council generally the recommendations of the CCLM that the proposed amendments would not involve new obligations, but noted that this was a decision that lay within the competence of the Conference. One member indicated that it would be discussing this issue contained in the report of the CCLM on this matter during the Conference.
59. One member expressed concerns regarding the wording of some of the provisions of the revised Convention, which it felt might be interpreted as limiting the rights of contracting Parties under other relevant international agreements, including the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). It proposed forming a Contact Group to work on modified wording for these provisions in order to clarify the matter. A large majority of members of the Council expressed their opposition to forming the Contact Group or to any reopening of the negotiations of the text which had been unanimously endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997, particularly in view of the fact that many delegations did not have their technical experts present.
60. The Council noted a proposal by the Legal Counsel that an explanatory statement might be prepared for consideration by the Conference at the time of approving the amendments to the IPPC which might clarify the provisions in question, but members made no commitment as to whether such explanatory statement might prove acceptable. The Legal Counsel undertook to make a first draft of a possible explanatory statement avilable to members before the end of the Council session.
61. The Council expressed its satisfaction with the work done on the revision of the Convention, which it considered to be a great improvement on the existing text. It stressed the great importance of ensuring that the revised text be approved by the Conference at its Twenty-ninth Session. The Council expressed the wish that the amendments should be brought into force as soon as possible and endorsed the interim measures including the establishment of an interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures and its terms of reference and composition as modified by the CCLM (Appendix E).
62. The Council recommended that the following draft Resolution be transmitted to the Conference for its adoption:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
Amendments to the International Plant Protection Convention
THE CONFERENCE^,
Recalling its approval of the International Plant Protection Convention under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution at its Sixth Session in 1951, which Convention came into force on 3 April 1952,
Recalling its adoption of amendments to the Convention at its Twentieth Session in November 1979 by Resolution 14/79, which amendments came into force on 4 April 1991,
Being convinced of the continued need to protect plant life or health from the spread and introduction of pests,
Noting the agreements reached as a result of the Uruguay Round of Trade Negotiations and the references in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to the International Plant Protection Convention and international standards guidelines and recommendations developed for connection therewith,
Taking into account the need for the development of International Phytosanitary Standards to protect plant health without creating unnecessary impediments to the international transportation of plants, plant products and other articles deemed to require phytosanitary measures,
Recalling the agreement reached at its Twenty-fifth Session in November 1989 on the necessity of establishing a Secretariat within FAO for the International Plant Protection Convention,
Recalling that at its Twenty-seventh Session in November 1993, as an interim measure, it agreed to authorize the Director-General to establish the Committee on Phytosanitary Measures under Article VI.2 of the Constitution, and to establish the procedure that could be followed for the setting of harmonized international standards and guidelines,
Having considered the work of the Expert Consultation on the Revision of the IPPC held in April 1996, the Technical Consultation on the Revision of the IPPC held in January 1997, the Fourteenth Session of the Committee on Agriculture in April 1997 and the Hundred and Twelfth Session of the Council in June 1997,
Taking note of the recommendations contained in the report of the African Expert Consultation on the IPPC held in June 1997,
Having examined the text of the draft amendments to the IPPC endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997,
Having considered the observations contained in the Report of the Sixty-seventh Session of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters held in October 1997 and the Report of the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of Council,
Stressing that it is in the interest of the international community that the proposed amendments should enter into force without delay,
Noting that, in accordance with Article XII.4 of the Convention, the amendments will enter into force as from the thirtieth day after acceptance by two thirds of the contracting parties:
1. Approves the amendments to the International Plant Protection Convention set out in the Revised Text contained in Appendix D;
2. Takes note of the agreed interpretation contained in Appendix F;
3. Requests the Director-General to transmit the revised text incorporating the amendments to the Contracting Parties for their consideration with a view to their acceptance of the amendments;
4. Urges the Contracting parties to accept the amendments as early as possible;
5. Urges FAO Members and Non-Member States that have not yet done so to adhere to the Convention as early as possible;
6. Notes the specific need of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, for technical assistance in order to enhance their capacity to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate its implementation;
7. Urges that high priority be given to the provision of reports on the occurrence, outbreak and spread of pests to the Secretary of the IPPC and, underlines the importance of establishing relevant procedures applicable to this reporting;
8. Agrees to the establishment of an Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures under Article VI.1 of the FAO Constitution with the Terms of Reference contained in Appendix E;
9. Agrees that the present Secretariat to the IPPC shall continue until the amendments come into force and until then shall provide secretariat services to the Interim Commission;
10. Agrees that the present standard-setting procedure shall continue until the amendments come into force, or until the interim Commission decides otherwise, except that phytosanitary standards will be considered and adopted by the Interim Commission instead of by the Committee on Agriculture, Council and/or the Conference;
11. Authorizes the Secretariat to commence work on International Standards for non-quarantine regulated pests;
12. Authorizes the use of the amended phytosanitary certificate among Parties that accept it; and
13. Requests Parties to nominate an official contact point, and to communicate its nomination to the Secretariat.
Amendments to the Agreement for the Establishment of a General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean ^28
63. The Council reviewed the amendments to the Agreement establishing the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted by the GFCM at its Twenty-second Session held froom 13 to 16 October 1997 (document CL 113/5-Sup.1) in the light of the recommendations of the CCLM on the proposed amendments as set out in CL 113/5.
64. The Council noted that the CCLM had found the proposed amendments to be in proper legal form. It approved the recommendation of the CCLM, as endorsed by the GFCM itself, that the first set of amendments the main purpose of which was to allow for FAO Member Organizations in the region to become Members of the GFCM, would not involve new obligations for the contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement. These amendments would thus come into force on their approval by the FAO Council.
65. The second set of amendments the main purpose of which was to allow the GFCM to have its own autonomous budget, would involve new obligations. The Council also accepted the interpretation recommended by the CCLM to the effect that the latter amendments should come into force only after their acceptance by two-thirds of the GFCM Members, and thereafter for each Member accepting them.
66. The amendments enabling the regional economic integration organizations to join were welcomed in particular by the EC which indicated its hope that it would be in a position to deposit its instrument of acceptance shortly.
67. The Council adopted the following Resolution approving the amendments:
Resolution 3/113
Amendments to GFCM Agreement: Entry into Force
The COUNCIL,
Recalling that the GFCM Agreement was originally adopted in 1949, and that the Agreement has been amended in 1963, and 1976;
Noting that the GFCM at its Twenty-second session in Rome, from 13 to 16 October, 1997, in compliance with the amendment process set out in Article X of the Agreement, adopted by consensus a number of amendments to the GFCM Agreement, the main purposes of which are to permit regional economic integration organizations that are members of FAO to become Members of GFCM (see Appendix G), and further adopted by consensus with one reservation amendments to provide for an autonomous budget for GFCM (see Appendix H);
Having considered the report of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters at its Sixty-seventh Session, which considered the changes proposed to the Agreement and found them to be in proper legal form and in accordance with the Basic Texts of the Organization;
Noting that the report of CCLM found that the amendments set out in Appendix G would not involve new obligations and would accordingly come into force upon receiving the concurrence of the Council, and that the amendments set out in Appendix H would involve new obligations and would thus come into force with respect to each Member only on acceptance of it by that Member;
Having considered the statement of CCLM that "it was not clear in the present text of the GFCM Agreement whether the amendments involving new obligations would come into force for each Member on its acceptance thereof, or whether there would be a threshold of acceptance by two thirds of the Members before such amendments came into force" and that the CCLM "recommended the latter interpretation should be adopted, to avoid a situation whereby one accepting Member might find itself saddled with responsibility for the entire autonomous budget";
Noting further that this interpretation of the CCLM was adopted by the GFCM in the Report of its Twenty second Session:
1. Concurs in the amendments set out in Appendix G, which amendments will enter into force immediately;
2. Further concurs in the amendments set out in Appendix H, which will enter into force with respect to each Member only upon acceptance of it by that Member;
3. Agrees with the interpretation of the CCLM that the amendments to the Agreement set out in Appendix H will come into force, with respect to each Member that has accepted them, only when there have been received acceptances from two thirds of the Members;
4. Urges the Contracting Parties to accept the amendments set out in Appendix H as soon as possible.
Rome, 6 November 1997
Cooperation Agreement between FAO and the Centre for Marketing Information and Advisory Services for Fishery Products in the Arab Region (INFOSAMAK) ^29
68. The Council noted the recommendation of the CCLM that the proposed Cooperation Agreement was in conformity with Article XIII of the FAO Constitution and Conference Resolution No. 69/59: Guiding lines regarding relationship between FAO and Intergovernmental Organizations (Part N of the Basic Texts). It approved the Agreement in accordance with the General Rules of the Organization, and recommended that it be submitted to the Conference at its Twenty-ninth Session for confirmation.
69. The text of the Cooperation Agreement is attached as Appendix I.
Amendments to the General Rules of the Organization and Financial Regulations on the Programme Budget Process ^30
70. The Council noted that the proposed amendments to the General Rules of the Organization and Financial Regulations were designed to implement the recommendation of the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees to abolish the outline Programme of Work and Budget and to eliminate the Joint Meeting of those Committees required to be held in January of the Conference year to consider that outline. It also noted that further amendments to the Basic Texts of the Organization would be required at a subsequent stage, in the light of the outcome of the phased introduction and implementation of a new medium-term planning process on an experimental basis.
71. The Council also noted that the proposed amendments had been reviewed by the CCLM which found them to be in order from a legal point of view, and agreed to transmit the following draft Resolution to the Conference for adoption:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
Amendments to the Basic Texts on Abolition of the outline Programme of Work and Budget and the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committees early in the second year of the biennium
THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling that the Council, at its Hundred and Twelfth Session in June 1997, requested, on the basis of the recommendations of the Programme and Finance Committees, that options for an adapted medium-term planning process of FAO's activities be examined,
Noting the recommendations of the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session in November 1997, based on the joint recommendation of the Programme and Finance Committees at their joint meeting of September 1997, that a new medium-term planning process should be introduced in a flexible and step-by-step manner and that, meanwhile, the Conference should authorize the phased implementation of the medium-term planning process on an experimental basis in the course of the 1998-99 biennium,
Noting the recommendation of the Council, at its Hundred and Thirteenth Session in November 1997, that the Basic Texts of the Organization should be amended immediately in order to abolish the outline Programme of Work and Budget and the Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committee early in the second year of the biennium to consider that outline,
Realizing that these amendments would be without prejudice to the need for further amendments to be incorporated into the Basic Texts of the Organization, at a subsequent stage and in the light of the outcome of the implementation of a new medium-term planing process on an experimental basis,
Adopts the following amendments to the General Rules of the Organization (GRO) and the Financial Regulations (FR):
1. The word "outline," is deleted before the words "summary and draft Programme of Work and Budget" in the following provisions of the General Rules of the Organization:
(a) Rule XXVI, paragraph 7(a)(ii) (GRO);
(b) Rule XXVIII, paragraph 4 (GRO).
2. Rule XXVIII (GRO) is amended by deleting Paragraph 1 and renumbering the following paragraphs accordingly;
3. Rule XXXVII, paragraph 2(g) (i) is amended to read as follows: ^31
(a) in the light of guidance given by the Conference and Council at its previous sessions and by regional and technical conferences, commissions or committees, [DEL: an Outline Programme of Work and Budget for consideration by the Programme and Finance Committees, and :DEL] a summary Programme and Work and Budget for consideration by the Programme and Finance Committees, other appropriate organs of the Organization, and the Council; and ...."
4. Financial Regulation 3.5 is amended to read as follows:
"The Director-General shall arrange [DEL: for the outline budget to be considered by the Programme and Finance Committees early in the Conference year and :DEL] for the summary budget to be considered by the Council not less than 90 days before the date fixed for the opening of the regular session of the Conference".
Amendments to Financial Regulations 6.9 and 7.1^32
72. The Council agreed to the proposed amendments to Financial Regulations 6.9 to 7.1, as approved by the Finance Committee at its Eighty-eighth Session in September 1997 and reviewed by the CCLM.
73. However, the Council took note of the CCLM decision to bring to the attention of the Council and the Conference for their consideration that, in the proposed amendments of Financial Regulation 6.9, the concept of "advertising", presently limited to the FAO Magazine, would be extended to all information products.
74. The Council recommended that the following draft Resolution be considered and adopted by the Conference, at its Twenty-ninth Session:
Draft Resolution for the Conference
Amendment to Financial Regulations 6.9 and 7.1 (Publications Revolving Fund)
THE CONFERENCE,
Noting that the Finance Committee in its consideration of the Programme Evaluation Report at its Eighty-seventh Session invited the Secretariat to prepare detailed proposals for the reformulation of Financial Rule 6.9 to allow more flexible utilization of income from the sale of publication and other information materials,
Noting further that, in recent years, an increasing proportion of income to the Publications Revolving Fund came from sales of electronic publications, or electronic plus print, rather than from printed publications,
Considering that allowing some portion of the income generated through the publications activities to be credited to the originating departments would constitute an incentive to make publishing activities more cost effective,
Considering further that sufficient funds should be carried over, at the end of each financial period, to the next biennium, in order to allow forward planning of sales and marketing activities and continuity of staffing:
Decides to amend Financial Regulations 6.9 and 7.1 as follows:
FINANCIAL REGULATION 6.9 ^33
6.9 There shall be established an [DEL: Publications :DEL] Information Products Revolving Fund to which shall be credited the proceeds of sales of [DEL: films and publications including the proceeds of sales of the FAO Magazine and the revenue from advertising in that Magazine :DEL] information products and the revenue from advertising in and sponsorship of such products, except that where extra-budgetary funds are used to finance [DEL: films or publications :DEL] those information products, the proceeds of sales may be credited to such funds. The Fund shall be used only for the following purposes: (i) to meet the direct costs of [DEL: reprinting those publications and reissuing those films of the Organization :DEL] reproducing those information products for the sale of which there is a demand or producing new information products; (ii) to [DEL: promote :DEL] pay, [DEL: within a maximum amount determined by the Conference, the sale of films and publications of the
Organization :DEL] from within the resources available to the Fund, the direct costs, including costs of human resources and equipment, not covered by the Programme of Work and Budget, required for the sale and marketing of all such information products; and (iii) [DEL: to promote, within the maximum amount determined by the Conference, the development of the FAO Magazine to :DEL] credit the originating divisions with such proportion of the proceeds credited to the Fund, up to 20% thereof, as may be determined by the Director-General, to be utilized within the biennium in which it is credited. Any balance at the end of each financial period in excess of[DEL: $10,000 as shown in the Audited Accounts of the Fund :DEL] such sums as may be approved by the Finance Committee to cover commitments in respect of expenditures proposed by the Director-General for the following biennium shall be transferred to Miscellaneous Income [DEL: of the financial period during which the audit is
completed. :DEL]
FINANCIAL REGULATION 7.1
7.1 Contributions from Associate Members and all receipts other than:
(a) contributions from Member Nations to the budget;
(b) direct refunds of expenditures made during the financial period;
(c) advances by Member Nations to the Working Capital Fund or deposits to Trust and Special Funds and other receipts directly related to those funds; and
(d) proceeds of sales of[DEL: publications and films; and :DEL] information products and the revenue from advertising in and sponsorship of such products
(e) [DEL: revenue from advertising in the FAO Magazine :DEL]
shall be classed as Miscellaneous Income, for credit to the General Fund. Interest or other income derived from any Trust or Special Fund accepted by the Organization shall be credited to the fund to which it relates, unless provided for otherwise by the terms of the applicable Trust or Special Fund agreement.
Amendments to the Constitution of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease ^34
75. The Council noted that, subject to one minor modification, the CCLM had concluded that the proposed amendments to the Constitution and to the Financial Regulations were acceptable from a legal point of view and had recommended their approval.
76. Accordingly, the Council approved the amendments to the Constitution of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease with the modification suggested by the CCLM, and confirmed the amendments to its Financial Regulations, as set out in Appendix J.
INVITATIONS TO NON-MEMBER NATIONS TO ATTEND FAO SESSIONS^35
77. In accordance with paragraphs B-1 and B-2 of the "Statement of Principles relating to the Granting of Observer Status to Nations"^36, the Council agreed that:
a. the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan attend as observers the Hundred and Thirteenth Session of the FAO Council.
b. the Russian Federation attend as an observer the Thirty-first Session of the Intergovernmental Group on Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres, Rome, 26-28 November 1997.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL PLANT PROTECTION CONVENTION
(as endorsed by the Council at its Hundred and Twelfth Session and including changes recommended by the CCLM at its Sixty-seventh Session)^1
PREAMBLE
The contracting parties, recognizing the [DEL: usefulness of :DEL] necessity for international cooperation in controlling pests of plants and plant products and in preventing their international spread, and especially their introduction [DEL: across national boundaries, and :DEL] into endangered areas;
- recognizing that phytosanitary measures should be technically justified, transparent and should not be applied in such a way as to constitute either a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction, particularly on international trade;
- desiring to ensure close coordination of measures directed to these ends[DEL: , :DEL] ;
- desiring to provide a framework for the development and application of harmonized phytosanitary measures and the elaboration of international standards to that effect;
- taking into account internationally approved principles governing the protection of plant, human and animal health, and the environment; and
- noting the agreements concluded as a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, including the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures;
have agreed as follows:
ARTICLE I
Purpose and responsibility
1. With the purpose of securing common and effective action to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriate measures for their control, the contracting parties undertake to adopt the legislative, technical and administrative measures specified in this Convention and in supplementary agreements pursuant to Article [DEL: III :DEL] XV.
2. Each contracting party shall assume responsibility, without prejudice to obligations assumed under other international agreements, for the fulfilment within its territories of all requirements under this Convention.
3. The division of responsibilities for the fulfilment of the requirements of this Convention between Member Organizations of FAO and their member states that are contracting parties shall be in accordance with their respective competencies.
4.^2 Where appropriate, the provisions of this Convention may be deemed by contracting parties to extend, in addition to plants and plant products, to storage places, packaging, conveyances, containers, soil and any other organism, object or material capable of harbouring or spreading plant pests, particularly where international transportation is involved.
ARTICLE II
[DEL: Scope :DEL] Use of terms
[DEL: :DEL]
1. For the purpose of this Convention the term "plants" shall comprise living plants and parts thereof, including seeds in so far as the supervision of their importation under Article VI of the Convention or the issue of phytosanitary certificates in respect of them under Articles IV(1)(a)(iv) and V of this Convention may be deemed necessary by contracting parties; and the term "plant products" shall comprise unmanufactured material of plant origin (including seeds in so far as they are not included in the term "plants") and those manufactured products which, by their nature or that of their processing, may create a risk for the spread of pests.
2. For the purpose of this Convention, the term "pest" means any form of plant or animal life, or any pathogenic agent, injurious or potentially injurious to plants or plant products; and the term "quarantine pest" means a pest of potential national economic importance to the country endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being actively controlled.
Note:Paragraph transferred to new Article I.4 (see above)
1.For the purpose of this Convention, the following terms shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them:
"Area of low pest prevalence" - an area, whether all of a country, part of a country, or all or parts of several countries, as identified by the competent authorities, in which a specific pest occurs at low levels and which is subject to effective surveillance, control or eradication measures;
"Commission" - the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures established under Article X;
"Endangered area" - an area where ecological factors favour the establishment of a pest whose presence in the area will result in economically important loss;
"Establishment" - perpetuation, for the foreseeable future, of a pest within an area after entry;
"Harmonized phytosanitary measures"- phytosanitary measures established by contracting parties based on international standards;
"International standards" - international standards established in accordance with Article IX, paragraphs 1 and 2;
"Introduction" - the entry of a pest resulting in its establishment;
"Pest" - any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products;
"Pest risk analysis" - the process of evaluating biological or other scientific and economic evidence to determine whether a pest should be regulated and the strength of any phytosanitary measures to be taken against it;
"Phytosanitary measures" - any legislation, regulation or official procedure having the purpose to prevent the introduction and/or spread of pests;
"Plants" - living plants and parts thereof, including seeds and germplasm;
"Plant products" - unmanufactured material of plant origin (including grains) and those manufactured products that, by their nature or that of their processing, may create a risk for the introduction and spread of pests;
"Quarantine pest" - a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled;
"Regional standards" - standards established by a regional plant protection organization for the guidance of the members of that organization;
"Regulated article" - any plant, plant product, storage place, packaging, conveyance, container, soil or any other organism, object or material capable of harbouring or spreading pests, deemed to require phytosanitary measures, particularly where international transportation is involved;
[DEL: :DEL]
4. This Convention applies mainly to quarantine pests involved with international trade
"Regulated non-quarantine pest" - a non-quarantine pest whose presence in plants for planting affects the intended use of those plants with an economically unacceptable impact and which is therefore regulated within the territory of the importing contracting party;
"Regulated pest" - a quarantine pest and/or a regulated non-quarantine pest;
"Secretary" - Secretary of the Commission appointed pursuant to Article XI;
"Technically justified" - justified on the basis of conclusions reached by using an appropriate pest risk analysis or, where applicable, another comparable examination and evaluation of available scientific information.

ARTICLE II bis
Relationship with other international agreements
Nothing in this Convention shall affect the rights and obligations of the contracting parties under relevant international agreements.
ARTICLE III
Note:The substantive provisions of Article III - Supplementary Agreements - of the existing text of the IPPC have been transferred to new Article XV. The new Article III of the revised text follows that of Article IV of the existing text as modified below.[DEL: :DEL]
ARTICLE IV

1. Each contracting party shall make provision,[DEL: as soon as possible and :DEL] to the best of its ability, for

APPENDIX F
INTERPRETATIONS AS AGREED BY
THE THIRTEENTH COAG
Preamble:
It was understood that "taking into account" (fifth indent) does not result in a legal obligation.
Article II:
The definition of pest was adopted with the understanding that the term "injurious" includes both direct and indirect damage.
It was noted that the use of the term "technically justified" does not automatically require that the rationale for a phytosanitary measure be made immediately and publicly available. Such information is only required on request, under provisions of Article VI.2(c) of the revised text.
Article III:
While the term "consignments" includes non-commercial commodities, such as those carried by passengers, throughout the Convention, Article III.2(c) will not be interpreted to mean that official national plant protection organizations have obligations for the inspection of all outgoing passengers.
Article IV:
It was understood that the phrase in Article IV.2(a) "public officers who are technically qualified and duly authorized by the national plant protection organization" includes officers of that service.
Article IX:
To avoid numerous references to standards throughout the text, it was agreed to include in Article IX.4 "contracting parties shall undertake all activities related to this Convention in accordance with relevant international standards unless judged inappropriate for reasons that are technically justified".
Article X:
Article X.5: It was agreed that the quorum of the Commission should be addressed in the rules of procedure for the Commission. The rules of procedure should also consider the possibility of voting by correspondence.
Article XVI:
The European Commission (EC) confirmed that in implementation of Article XVI.3, the EC would, on adhering, be submitting a supplementary declaration describing the division of competencies between the EC and its Member States with respect to matters covered by the IPPC.
MODEL PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATE:
The International Standard on the issuance of the Phytosanitary Certificate should be prepared. It should clarify the use and proper completion of the "place of origin".
The statement "they are deemed to be practically free from other pests" represents an option available to the exporting contracting party.
It is recognized that the proposed revision to the certifying statement for the phytosanitary certificate is an interim solution only. It is expected that this statement will be reviewed again as soon as the revised Convention has been adopted by the Conference. The references to "considered to be free from the quarantine pests" and "deemed to be practically free from other pests" should be especially reviewed.

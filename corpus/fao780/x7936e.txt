<title>REPORT OF THE FIRST CONSULTATION ON AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</title>
<section>1</section>
I. INTRODUCTION
A. CONVENING OF THE MEETING AND GENERAL AIMS
1. Attendance at this First Consultation on Agricultural Information Management (COAIM) was invited by the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in his circular letter (Ref. G / GIL-804) dated 13 March 2000, addressed to all the Member Nations of FAO, and to international and other institutions.
2. The general aims of the COAIM were to bring policy issues related to management and access to agricultural information to the attention of the inter-governmental process, and to establish a global framework for the normative work of the World Agricultural Information Centre (WAICENT), recognizing the key role that information and knowledge play in ensuring food security and sustainable development, and thereby meeting the objectives of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.
3. Additionally, the COAIM set out to discuss ways of improving the capacities of decision-makers, professionals and the public at large in member countries to access and use information essential for achieving sustainable agriculture development and food security. The COAIM covered key aspects of agricultural information management, capacity building and improving access to relevant information.
B. PARTICIPANTS
4. The First COAIM (Rome, 5-7 June 2000) was attended by 161 representatives of the 91 Member Nations of FAO. Among the participants were observers from one United Nations Member State, representatives from four United Nations specialized agencies, observers from 24 intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations having status with FAO and from seven institutes of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Countries and organizations represented at the session are shown in Appendix A.

II. OPENING OF THE CONSULTATION
A. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
5. The Consultation was opened by Mr Anton Mangstl, on behalf of Ms Carleen Gardner, the Assistant Director-General of the General Affairs and Information Department of FAO. Mr Mangstl then gave the floor to Ms Louise Fresco, Assistant Director-General of the Agriculture Department of FAO, who delivered the opening speech. In welcoming the participants Ms Fresco expressed her pleasure in opening this first COAIM, and in having been invited to launch this important initiative on information management which is central to FAO's work in achieving the aims of the World Food Summit.
6. Ms Fresco reported on the progress made since the Fourth AGRIS / CARIS^1 Technical Consultation held in June 1998. She informed the delegates of the significant progress made in improving access to agricultural information world-wide using the most up to date Internet technologies. She then went on to report on the progress achieved in modernizing the processing of AGRIS data generally, and in reorienting efforts towards producing better tools and systems. The successful transfer of all AGRIS processing functions to Rome has already brought a significant gain in both time and efficiency and will ultimately assist in enhancing information management capacities within the countries themselves.
7. Ms Fresco announced to the delegates the establishment of the Outreach Programme of WAICENT which will play a large part in developing and strengthening knowledge exchange and information systems available in member countries and the international community associated with agricultural development and food security. The Programme will also provide positive support to work in the decentralization of AGRIS.
8. Ms Fresco then presented a strategic view of agriculture in the 21^st century as an information-intensive sector of the global economy - moving away from an artisanal, extensive, traditional activity towards a more sophisticated, computerized sector of the economy. She described the agriculture of the future as entailing more efficient and sustainable production systems, making optimal use of resources such as water and managing land in a more intensive way. With time these changes will push agriculture into new domains where access to information is a necessity and not a luxury.
9. Ms Fresco went on to emphasize that in future food security and agricultural development will require a participatory process involving everyone: the government, the private sector, the academic community, farmer organizations and civil society in general. Information exchange will be an essential part of the institutional innovations that will be required for the participatory process to really work: to participate actively we must be better informed.
10. It was reiterated by the speaker that this first COAIM will launch policy dialogues on issues such as access to agricultural information, capacity building and standards. She urged the delegates to participate actively in the debates that would follow.
11. Ms Fresco closed her address by renewing a warm welcome to the participants and assuring them that FAO valued their time and advice. She was confident that their counsel during this Consultation would help to establish the COAIM as the mechanism for policy dialogue on agricultural information management.
B. ELECTION OF OFFICERS
12. Ms Neela Gangadharan, Alternate Permanent Representative from India, was elected as Chairperson of the meeting, Ms Pamela Andre, Director National Agricultural Library, USA, as Vice-Chairperson, and Mr. Humberto Molina Reyes, Alternate Representative from the Republic of Chile, as Rapporteur. Mr Francisco Perez-Trejo, (WAICENT Manager, GIL, FAO) acted as Secretary.
C. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND TIMETABLE FOR THE SESSION
13. The Agenda and Timetable were approved with some minor modifications. The Agenda as adopted is set out in Appendix B and the List of Documents is given in Appendix C.
D. KEYNOTE ADDRESS
14. Mr Gorjestani, Chief Knowledge Officer, Africa Region, World Bank gave the Keynote Address, "Information and Knowledge for Empowerment". A summary of the presentation is given in Appendix D.
E. PRESENTATION OF WAICENT
15. The presentation of WAICENT started with a short video. Mr Perez-Trejo, WAICENT Manager, FAO, reminded the Consultation of the importance of information, which represents one of the main challenges for the Organization, and which is contained in the First Article of the Constitution of FAO. He gave a brief outline of current WAICENT activities and developments (http://waicent.fao.org), and described the ways in which WAICENT has improved access to FAO's wealth of information accumulated over the past 50 years, to become FAO's strategic programme on agricultural information management. WAICENT provides the platform for generating information and for developing standards; specialized tools such as the "Information Finder" have been elaborated to facilitate access in a thematic direction to the Organization's information.
16. The priorities for the period 2000-2006 were: (i) the Outreach Programme and capacity building among Member Nations; (ii) normative activities such as development of AGROVOC and support to the Codex Alimentarius; and (iii) contributions to activities such as the Plan of Action of the Food Summit, the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS), and the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS).
17. The Consultation praised WAICENT for the progress made to date in the development and implementation of systems, and some delegations requested that certain issues be recognized and addressed. The Consultation acknowledged that the issue of information quality was paramount.
18. The Consultation agreed that there should be equal treatment with regards all official languages in all WAICENT activities. The Consultation agreed that the multilingual approach is of comparative advantage to FAO and requested that the Organization concentrate its efforts on the full implementation of the language policy in order to make available a greater proportion of the substantive information content in all the official languages, especially in Arabic and Chinese.
19. The Consultation recognized that the constraint of the "digital divide" included many aspects of organizational and personal culture, particularly for the older generation, that were not to be solved merely by the introduction of new systems and tools. It was agreed that FAO enhance as much as possible the two-way nature of information exchange with Members, to obtain maximum value from collaborative links. The need to strengthen the information exchange and management capacities of many developing countries was clearly acknowledged, and the new WAICENT Outreach Programme was seen as a highly appropriate mechanism for extending the Organizations support.

III. PLENARY DISCUSSIONS ON
AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
A. IMPROVING ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION (COAIM 1 / 2)
20. Dr V P Sharma of the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE), Hyderabad, made a short presentation entitled "Cyber Extension: Indian Initiatives for The Extension Approach in The New Millennium". Access to information and improved communication is a crucial requirement for sustainable agricultural development. He observed that modern communication technologies - when applied to conditions in rural areas - can help to improve communication, increase active participation and further the dissemination of information and sharing of knowledge and skills. He believes that "Cyber Extension" will be the major form of technology dissemination in the near future, allowing for the fact that the rural population still has difficulty in accessing crucial information in order to make timely decisions. Dr Sharma stressed that it is essential that information supply is demand-led rather than supply-driven.
21. Dr Sharma reiterated that the challenge is not only to improve the accessibility of communication technology to the rural population but also to improve its relevance to local development. The various national organizations in India have a very important role to play in packaging information on agricultural extension and rural development policies, schemes, programmes and working mechanisms at the grass-root level and hosting the same on their websites. He proposed that it is incumbent on the entire community involved in working with rural communities, including administrators, NGOs, trainers and scientists, to provide information access as widely as possible in the rural areas in order to "to reach the unreached".
22. The Secretariat then presented the key elements of the paper COAIM 1/2. The Consultation welcomed the analysis of issues and the general approach taken in the paper, and concurred that FAO's core area of expertise was in the gathering and dissemination of information content, rather than in the area of information technology. The Consultation stressed the importance of the fact that access to knowledge and information is critical for sustainable development, and for those components that are relevant to FAO: namely, agricultural productivity, food security, and sustainable development. It was acknowledged that the adoption of quality standards was of paramount importance in facilitating access to information. Some delegations pressed for more effective availability of FAO's experience and information management tools at the local level.
23. Many delegations emphasized the need for the full and fair implementation of the language policy of FAO, following on from the interventions made after the presentation of WAICENT; in particular, in the area of greater accessibility of WAICENT content in Arabic and Chinese. The Secretariat explained that the appropriate tools to ensure full implementation of this policy were still under development, but it was hoped that these tools would eventually reduce the need for extensive human intervention in full-text translations. The delegates stressed that improved language coverage is linked to the wider issue of the quality of access to information in WAICENT by Members.
24. The Consultation recognized the importance of the proposed decentralization of the WAICENT programme, particularly in the context of greater access to information at a variety of levels in and between Member Nations. The potential establishment of regional and sub-regional mirror sites for WAICENT was also regarded as a positive move. The Consultation agreed to place a high priority on improving access to agricultural information through WAICENT with Members, and other stakeholders, taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by the new generation of information and communication technologies.
25. Some delegations called upon the Organization to promote appropriate use of modern information and communication technologies in the context of those rural communities in many developing countries which lack adequate, or even basic, infrastructures. One delegation stressed that FAO's own information resources would only satisfy a small part of the requirement at the local level, and that national organizations themselves must be responsible for locally-derived content, and the eventual modification of internationally-sourced material to suit the needs of users. Some delegations suggested that it would be instrumental for FAO to work at the national level in support of development for information exchange through local channels, given the scale of the potential demand for collaboration. The Secretariat clarified that the WAICENT Outreach Programme would be a key platform for working with national programmes. In addition, it was felt that the impact on poverty and food
security would be enhanced by the effort to strengthen and improve knowledge exchange systems at the grassroots level. Some delegates emphasized the role of programmes such as the Special Programme on Food Security (SPFS) in facilitating the promulgation of WAICENT's experience. The Consultation recommended that special attention be given to the needs of small producers in the access to information. The decentralization of information systems constitutes one of the means of reaching this objective.
26. The Consultation recommended that FAO play a key role in co-ordinating agencies active in the agricultural sector in order to promote effective collaboration in capacity-building efforts with member countries, facilitate the advance towards the goal of sustainable agriculture, and ensure economically viable access to information and communication technologies. The Consultation called on the Organization to collect and document evidence of the successful introduction of new approaches and implementation of information and knowledge systems based on modern technologies. Evidence of the impact of information would have a significant bearing on the potential collaboration provided by Members.
27. The Consultation emphasized that future consultations should take on the role of facilitating an FAO-wide programme covering key aspects of access to information and knowledge, thus reflecting the inherent cross-sectoral nature of information management, with the principal task of encouraging and supporting the efforts of Member Nations, NGOs and other organizations.
B. STRENGTHENING INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPACITIES THROUGH INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION ( COAIM 1 / 3 )
28. The Secretariat introduced the representative of the European Centre for Development Policy Management, Mr P Ballantyne, who presented the key elements of Paper COAIM 1/3. The Consultation congratulated the Secretariat on a concise and informative Paper, and recognized that international co-ordination and co-operation are key elements in the improvement of effectiveness in capacity building for information access. The Consultation noted with interest the excellent presentation made by Mr Woldemeskel, Head of MIS and Database Service in the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia, on the development of a national agricultural information system in the Federal Republic of Ethiopia. The Consultation recommended that FAO promote co-ordination between development assistance agencies in the international community working in capacity building in the area of information management in agriculture, thereby avoiding duplication, bringing together complementary skills and sharing
experiences.
29. Some delegations also recognized the need for co-ordination of the many initiatives in the field of agricultural information and knowledge exchange based on new technologies, and suggested that FAO establish a mechanism for co-ordination with key international agencies, reporting back to Member Nations on relevant issues, so that roles and responsibilities are made clearer, synergies are achieved and duplication is minimized.
30. Several delegations emphasized the lack of skills and infrastructure in their governmental organizations, and highlighted the need for inputting resources in the form of financial assistance, technology and skilled manpower. Other delegations emphasized that allowance must be made for the fact that the speed of development varies between and within countries when planning information systems development. The Consultation agreed that decisions on the design and implementation of systems needed to be deliberated at the national or local level, taking into full account the needs of users including those at the grassroots level where appropriate. Some delegations suggested that in the area of capacity building, FAO should be able play the supporting role by acting as an intermediary, particularly between public and private sectors and through the provision of norms and standards.
31. Some delegations requested that the FAO Council examine the possibility of defining a sub-programme of capacity building and training in information generation and management. Some observer organizations suggested that FAO and other international agencies focus their attention primarily on influencing decision-makers, and only become involved directly in technical training in computing or information management skills when absolutely necessary.
32. Several delegations noted that the policy of decentralization of WAICENT would also be appropriate in the case of FAO's activities in capacity building of all stakeholders, including farmers, although it was recognized that WAICENT's resources in the field programme were limited. The Czech Republic highlighted the importance of the role of FAO National Committees for information management at the national level in Central and Eastern Europe.
33. Several delegations stressed that FAO should respond to clearly articulated needs, and that it is essential that the information supply is "demand-led" and not "supply driven". The mistakes of "supply-driven" research, with the production of unwanted outputs, should not be repeated. The Consultation recognized the importance of Impact Assessment (IA) in agricultural information management, and noted the outcomes of the workshop on this subject jointly organized by FAO and CTA, and recommended that these and other organizations work together to develop and promote the use of easy-to-apply IA frameworks and methodologies.
34. The Secretariat underlined that WAICENT's existing strategy in the medium term is focusing on three types of intervention: (i) strengthening capacities at the regional level, (ii) assessment of information needs as a continuing process, and (iii) working at the national level mainly through field projects and priority programmes such as the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping Systems (FIVIMS) and the Special Programme on Food Security (SPFS). In order to implement this strategy, WAICENT is identifying key partners in the governmental, non-governmental and private sectors, and is also developing tools and applications to provide to Members that will maximize the impact of the experience that it has gathered. The Secretariat explained that the longer term strategy will focus on the normative role involving the continuing improvement and development of standards and procedures.
35. Finally, the Consultation highlighted the importance of international co-operation in strengthening capacities in the generation of information, as was expressed in the Paragraphs 24 and 25 of Document COAIM 1/4. In other respects, horizontal co-operation links should be promoted between Member Nations for the development of information systems.
C. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (COAIM 1 / 4 )
36. The Secretariat presented the key elements of Paper COAIM 1 / 4. The paper was welcomed by the Consultation, which recognized the crucial importance of standards for addressing some of the key problems affecting access to agricultural information and data exchange on the Internet. This includes the implementation of international agreements on content management, classification schemes and agreed vocabularies.
37. Several Delegations reported on the numerous national and international initiatives in the area of standards in agricultural information. The Consultation recommended that FAO assume a leading role as a clearing-house for international agreed information management standards in the agricultural sector. The Consultation recommended that FAO, in collaboration with other stakeholders in the agricultural sector, co-ordinate and facilitate the promotion and adoption of such standards with Member Nations.
38. The Consultation noted with interest the proposals to adopt Standard Generalized Mark-up Language (SGML) and Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) as standards for document management, and many delegations were favourable to their adoption as standards. As a controlled vocabulary, AGROVOC was recognized as a very valuable tool for better information management and some delegations supported the adoption of AGROVOC as a standard. Given the importance of the multilingual approach and since it was agreed that FAO has a comparative advantage in this regard, the Consultation recommended that FAO maintain and develop AGROVOC further. Other Member Nations expressed the desire to see FAO providing a neutral forum, offering a framework of thesaurus, presenting the pros and cons of all available thesauri instead of promoting a single thesaurus. Some Delegations also emphasized that FAO should collaborate with other relevant international initiatives, such as the Global Forum on
Agricultural Research.
39. The needs for further development of standardization in other domains such as, for example, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), search interface ergonomics and publication of meta-data information, were also recognized by the Consultation.
40. The Japanese Delegation reported that Japan has adopted SGML as a standard for documentation, but that there were few cases where the standard was applied. They expressed their support for the use of the XML standards for documentation and offered to work with other countries in the region on the adoption and use of FAO standards to improve access to agricultural information. They informed the Consultation of their decision to produce the AGROVOC thesaurus in Japanese.
41. Some Intergovernmental Organizations reported on activities they had undertaken to disseminate and improve the use of AGROVOC as the standard controlled vocabulary in agriculture, at the national and regional levels.
42. The Spanish Delegation noted the importance of strengthening FAO's information programme by having it designated as a major programme of the Organization. The delegation noted that this would provide a cross-disciplinary, cross-departmental framework that is required to cover the normative role of WAICENT across all areas of Organization's work, particularly fisheries. This major programme would encompass two sub-programmes: a normative sub-programme and an operational sub-programme. The possible creation of this major programme should be presented and discussed at the FAO Council.
43. Some delegations requested a clear commitment from FAO on the development of an XML-based document processing toolbox by FAO, as a tool to, inter alia, enable AGRIS participating centres to move from the traditional "input data centre" concept to the "resources centre" concept, as part of the global decentralization trend. Many delegations considered that FAO's role should also include technical advice on standards using XML, in order to have a consistent approach that can be used across national programmes.

SUMMARY OF MR GORJESTANI PRESENTATION
Mr Gorjestani, Chief Knowledge Officer, Africa Region, World Bank gave the Keynote Address, "Information and Knowledge for Empowerment". He had four key messages for the Consultation, which were the following: (i) the knowledge era changes the rules of the game, (ii) a framework is needed to learn and share knowledge, (iii) a key aim should be the empowerment of local communities, and (iv) it should be possible to leverage the capabilities of institutions into improving knowledge exchange. Mr Gorjestani then went on to describe knowledge and learning frameworks which illustrate how information and knowledge can be used to empower and enable. He showed their potential by describing various examples of the use of indigenous knowledge to empower local communities. He went on to trace the process of adaptation that is the key to leveraging global and indigenous knowledge systems needed to increase development impact.
Mr Gorjestani concluded by proposing to the Consultation a six point approach for FAO's programme for WAICENT. The mission and purpose of the programme needed to be carefully outlined, together with a clear definition of the organization's sources of competitive advantage. It should move forward with the development of appropriate information management systems bearing in mind the human element of the process. FAO should aim to develop a framework for the sharing of information and knowledge, leveraging global and local knowledge systems, based on strong partnerships.

WORKSHOPS RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
* Workshop 1 : AGRIS / CARIS
* Workshop 2 : The Role of Information and Communication Technologies in Rural Development and Food Security
* Workshop 3 : Impact Assessment for Information System Development
WORKSHOP 1
AGRIS / CARIS
BACKGROUND
As part of the 1^st Consultation on Agricultural Information Management (COAIM) held at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome 5-7th June 2000, a Technical Workshop was conducted on AGRIS / CARIS. There were approximately 50 participants in the workshop from a range of public and private sector organizations.
Mr J.F. Giovannetti (CIRAD, France) was elected as the Chairperson, and Mr C. Revie (University of Strathclyde, U.K.) as the Rapporteur.
Mr Johannes Keizer (FAO-WAICENT) provided an introduction to the developments within the AGRIS / CARIS Network since the Technical Consultation in 1998. Achievements included the successful completion of the first phase of the activities: namely, the smooth integration of the activities previously carried out by the AGRIS Processing Centre in Vienna into the WAICENT group in Rome. He also reported on progress in the second and third phases of activity, dealing with the development of a new generation of tools and procedures to aid the smooth transition to an eventual full decentralization of the Network. (Full details of this work can be found in Paper X7318/E of the COAIM, "AGRIS / CARIS Network: Progress Report and Future Challenges".)
Mr Stephen Rudgard (FAO-WAICENT) gave an overview of the strategic importance of AGRIS and CARIS, in which he emphasized that the systems still had an important role to play within the new WAICENT framework, and especially in the context of WAICENT's new Outreach Programme. The re-analysis of AGRIS / CARIS as a system had indicated that the principles, experience, good will and collaborative network of individuals and institutes involved in AGRIS and CARIS should be retained and developed as FAO moves into a new phase of activity. In addition, technological advances had allowed for a more ambitious approach to agricultural information management, with a single platform able to support greater functionality.
Four short presentations were then made to inform delegates of the new developments within AGRIS / CARIS:
a) The AGRIS / CARIS network on the Web (J. Keizer, FAO)
A demonstration of the new AGRIS / CARIS interface was presented by Mr Keizer. The system will be accessible outside FAO hopefully from early July 2000 and will form an integrated part of the WAICENT Website. Some of the functionality is still being refined, and expertise has also been provided by external partners as a model for the participatory approach which WAICENT sees as increasingly important to future developments. Key principles underlying the new AGRIS / CARIS system include:
* a single gateway to key agricultural information resources of various types;
* customizable individual profiles - Selected Dissemination of Information (SDI);
* integrated access to the AGROVOC thesaurus tool to assist input and retreival;
* multi-host parallel database searching (see 5.c.)
b) ISIS tools for data input and dissemination (K. Caprazli and S. Kaloyanova, FAO) c) Multi-host database searching (H. Friedrich, ZADI)
d) A DTD for AGRIS: proposal of a new standard for bibliographic records (H. Besemer, OneWorld Europe)
The discussions that followed these presentations are reported in terms of the three topic areas adopted by the delegates during the Workshop to help frame their questions and provide cohesion to the discussion.
CONCLUSIONS
The new role of AGRIS / CARIS Centres
The Workshop discussed the new vision for the AGRIS / CARIS Network and for the Centres that comprise it. The Workshop agreed that FAO should work with Member Nations to strengthen the role of the Network as a cooperative system using the new approach, and the AGRIS / CARIS Centres were encouraged to maintain and / or expand their databases and repository of documents. However, a range of regional and national initiatives were underway that would enhance the Centres' capacities to be more active in the management and publication of agricultural information as the demand for information increases, especially given the new and increasingly heterogeneous data formats.
The Workshop noted that the Centres involved in the Network had over time become known as "Input Centres", and it was agreed that this implied a very narrow and prescriptive role. In the light of new demands and the opportunities provided by Web-based technologies, it is clear that the Centres should move from `data input' to `information management'. It was widely concurred that a much more appropriate and accurate title would be "AGRIS / CARIS Resource Centres".
The relationship between WAICENT and the Resource Centres should be seen as collaborative with the new range of initiatives being undertaken on a partnership basis. Collaboration could be in the area of the aggregation of local content (e.g. Morocco's proposed integration of full text, maps and statistics into their national AGRIS network), or in development of tools and techniques (e.g. ZADI's development of multi-host searching tools).
Availability of tools and techniques
The Workshop recognized that each Resource Centre would have its particular information management needs, which together with the local infrastructure, resources and skills would influence the choice of system solution. Centres would be free to decide on whether to adopt the WAICENT tools and techniques, given that the latter would be based on non-proprietary and internationally agreed standards. The various solutions selected by Resource Centres would form a cohesive framework provided that a minimum set of standards were adopted, to allow effective retrieval of information. It was agreed that considerable synergistic benefits and cost efficiencies would accrue to the network as a result of cooperation on standards.
The Secretariat informed the Workshop that a suite of tools for input and retrieval / dissemination of material for AGRIS and CARIS based around a set of standards will be available to the AGRIS / CARIS Network before the end of 2000. It was agreed that FAO should continue to develop such standards for information exchange and retrieval.
The particular importance of the XML standard was noted, in the sense of `extensibility' which is the key to accessing the heterogeneous sets of digital objects (through Data Type Definitions - DTDs) that are being handled by the new information requirements of the AGRIS / CARIS centres. In addition, XML has an international scope, has in-built support for multiple languages (UNICODE) and is compatible with any documents written in HTML.
It was recognized that staff working in AGRIS / CARIS Resource Centres, in the extended network, will require training in the use of these tools, if their full potential is to be realized. The Workshop was informed that the WAICENT team will explore and establish innovative means to deliver such training, including through the use of in-country training partners and computer-enhanced distance learning.
Primary documents
The Workshop acknowledged that AGRIS/CARIS Resource Centres have only a limited capability to supply simple full-text documents within the current framework, and that AGRIS/CARIS should be seen as a reference database pointing to increasingly richer full text documents being managed by Resource Centres and their partners. It was agreed that there is a need to develop a clear understanding of the implication on IPR and copyright issues of the shift to offering full text or images, and to ensure existence of strategies to maintain appropriate `ownership' of content archived in a variety of digital formats.
The Workshop noted that the old distinction between the formal scientific literature and the `grey' or `fugitive' variety was increasingly being re-evaluated. It was acknowledged that the inclusion of `grey' material has been a relative strength of AGRIS. The growth of e-journals and other valuable but inherently informal publishing channels has led to an increasing volume of agricultural literature which does not conform to established documentation norms, but which needs to be made more accessible. It was agreed that WAICENT and the AGRIS / CARIS Resource Centres must ensure that the AGRIS / CARIS Network is a key enabler and catalyst to establish this new model of agricultural information management in the 21^st century.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The following major recommendations and agreements emerged from the discussion session of the Workshop:
1. a more appropriate and accurate title for collaborating centres would be "AGRIS / CARIS Resource Centres";
2. a minimum set of information management standards should be developed by FAO and adopted by the AGRIS/CARIS network, to allow effective exchange and retrieval of information and to accrue considerable synergistic benefits and cost efficiencies;
3. the potential impact on IPR and copyright issues of inclusion of entire documents or other objects should be clearly understood by all parties, ensuring appropriate `ownership' of content archived in various digital formats;
4. the AGRIS / CARIS Network should be a key enabler and catalyst to establish a new model of agricultural information management in the 21^st century.
Workshop 2
The Role of Information and Communication Technologies
in Rural Development and Food Security
BACKGROUND
As part of the First Consultation on Agricultural Information Management (COAIM) held at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome 5-7th June 2000, a workshop was conducted on the role of information and communication technologies in rural development and food security. There were approximately 25 participants in the workshop from a range of public and private sector organizations.
1. In preparation for the workshop, two papers were prepared: Information and communication technologies for rural development and food security: lessons from field experiences in developing countries by Hilda Munyua, CAB-International, Africa Regional Centre, Kenya)
2. Rural development and food security: a community informatics-based conceptual framework (Michael Gurstein, Technical University of British Columbia, Canada).
These papers constituted the background for discussions on the implementation and building of partnerships for information and communication technology (ICT) related activities. Workshop participants agreed that both papers represent an accurate synthesis of the issues and assessments of ongoing efforts to apply ICTs to rural development and food security.
Information and communication technologies (ICTs), and particularly the Internet, are transforming broad areas where information is a central activity, including rural development and food security. The transformation is based on the opportunities for individuals and communities to be information producers as well as consumers; in addition it builds on and integrates the capacities of other media (e.g. radio and television). The advent of ICTs and the Internet is enabling increasingly low-cost access and distribution of information, and also facilitates interactive participation in the creation and use of information. In this process there is a priority role for generating and distributing public information. This in turn is transforming organizations everywhere which create, manage and distribute information.
The social context and the emerging information culture of ICTs should be given higher priority than purely technical and commercial considerations would imply. While the Internet is impacting on the commercial sector, there is a need for a parallel transformation in the concepts and practices of those institutions with responsibility in the public and non-profit sectors to reflect the new opportunities presented by ICTs.
ICTs offer the unprecedented opportunity for decentralizing information access and creation. This in turn brings demand-led innovation to all spheres of information-intensive activities, resulting in a change in the mode of information development and management, requiring a networked rather than a centralized approach.
There is a need to integrate the currently fragmented institutional experiences applying ICTs to rural development and food security.
KEY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Policy / Governance
Current government policy on the use of ICTs is primarily directed towards the management of telecommunications infrastructure. Rural populations are disadvantaged with regard to access to information and supporting ICTs.
There is a need for broad-based and equitable access to ICTs in rural areas consistent with ongoing processes of decentralization, democratization and policy revisions, in the context of global and national governance considerations.
There is a further need for the adjustment of policies and awareness-raising with respect to capacity building in the context of emerging ICT opportunities.
Recommendations:
A specific policy regime needs to be established to ensure equitable access for rural populations to information and ICTs.
There is a need for high-level "championing" of the use of ICTs for development which would include a coalition of stakeholders and new institutional partnerships.
FAO, in conjunction with other agencies, should develop draft policies in support of the application of ICTs in rural development.
Finance / Sustainability
ICTs for rural development are not given sufficient priority in national budgets. Strategies for financial sustainability for the use of ICTs in rural development need to be formulated.
Recommendations:
The development of open and proactive policies for the rural telecommunication sector is releasing considerable demand for expansion of service. Such changes should proceed within a context of social accountability and attention to the needs of under-served populations. A portion of revenue from telecommunications should be used to support and promote the expansion of ICT infrastructure in rural areas.
Investments in ICTs should be assessed in the context of their contributions to long-term human capital development in areas such as health care, skills development (e.g. for employment), continuing education and environmental management.
There is a need to provide investment and policy structures to stimulate initial demand (thereby reducing investment risk) for rural ICTs and to facilitate the leverage of investments in infrastructure.
Design
There is a need to develop ICT strategies for rural areas taking into consideration differences in language, culture, socio-economic conditions and infrastructure. There is also a need to encourage the private sector to invest in the design of ICTs appropriate for use in rural areas.
The opportunity exists for individuals and communities to become content developers, to appropriate the technology and to create the information resources that respond to their needs.
Recommendations:
The socio-economic context should be integral to the design of ICT projects. Local initiatives should be encouraged to explore the opportunities presented by ICTs and incorporate participatory communication and learning processes. Appropriate methodologies for needs assessments should be implemented (e.g. participatory rural communication appraisal).
Projects should be undertaken to examine the specific requirements for the selection and use of ICTs in rural development (e.g. technological solutions and standards for information collection, processing and storage specific to rural areas), with special consideration for cultural and linguistic diversity.
ICTs should be linked to traditional communication forms to meet identified needs and reach specific groups (e.g. rural radio linked to the Internet).
There is a need to move away from centrally maintained reservoirs of information towards an approach which links widely distributed information resources with a variety of providers.
Capacity Building
The realization of the opportunities offered by ICTs for rural development and food security require a culture of information and new skills.
Recommendations:
There is a need to build awareness among decision makers and stakeholders, including regional organizations, on the need for investment in ICT capacity building at all levels of formal and non-formal education. This includes training development workers to incorporate ICTs in their activities. Furthermore, emphasis should be placed on training women and youth in using ICTs and ensuring the inclusion of disadvantaged groups.
The private sector should be encouraged to extend its current involvement in technical training for ICTs to rural areas and efforts should be made to ensure new opportunities for training in open source as well as proprietary software.
Content / Applications
There is currently a shortage of content, applications and access to existing data of particular interest to rural development and food security. Beyond physical access, data need to be timely, retrievable and easily applied by a broad range of users.
There exists now the opportunity for participation by small and decentralized content providers, ensuring that information is available in local languages and reflects local cultures.
Recommendations:
Information providers, such as FAO and other rural development agencies, should further facilitate access to their resources. Procedures should also be implemented to enable feedback and widen participation in the development of these information resources.
The information needs of various users should be identified in order to develop user-specific, locally-sensitive content and applications. The role of civil society and the private sector is a key one in this identification process.
Rural development institutions should provide support at local level for rural people to generate their own content and applications.
Studies
Information about the use and impact of ICTs in rural development is at present incomplete.
Recommendations:
There is a need to extend the monitoring, evaluation and documentation of successful and unsuccessful applications of ICTs for rural development and to develop models for identifying strategic future investments and programmes.
Research and pilot projects on the role of ICTs in support of rural development should be extended.
Workshop 3
Impact Assessment for Information System Development
BACKGROUND
As part of the First Consultation on Agricultural Information Management (COAIM), held at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome, 5-7th June 2000, the ACP-EU Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation (CTA), organized a workshop in collaboration with FAO, on "impact assessment (IA) for information system development". There were approximately 30 participants in the workshop from a range of public and private sector organizations in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, as well as representatives of international organizations.
Discussions were based on the knowledge and experience of participants as well as material from the following background documents:
3. Introduction to impact assessment in agricultural information management: from theory to practice, or how to make IA both effective and user friendly? by Margot Bellamy, CAB International, UK
4. Summary report of the ECART/ASARECA/CTA workshop on Impact assessment of agricultural research in Eastern and Central Africa, Entebbe, Uganda, 16-19 November 1999
5. Assessing the impact of information and communication management on institutional performance; proceedings of a CTA workshop, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 27-29 January, 1998
CONCLUSIONS
Definition of impact assessment
Impact assessment is a tool for measuring qualitative and quantitative changes arising from intended and unintended effects of programme and project activities.
Usefulness of impact assessment in information management
IA is an essential part of the planning process, and is a mechanism for ongoing institutional learning. Lessons learnt from IA can be fed back into subsequent activities so that mistakes are not repeated. Return on investment can be demonstrated and accountability ensured. Outcomes can be evaluated against objectives, and the benefits of information activities can be measured.
Challenges for impact assessment
The full value of information activities is not always appreciated. Information is often seen as a subject for librarians or computer technicians, rather than as an integral part of every agricultural programme. One by-product of this situation is that most information programmes are not systematically monitored, evaluated, or assessed. Public sector organizations in particular tend to place insufficient emphasis on the measurement of information programme results. Individuals and organizational units concerned with assessment are often not integrated into planning and implementation processes, and their outputs are not used.
Methodology for assessing the impact of information management
Impact assessment should be part of a normal project cycle. This will involve an examination of project preparation, project implementation, and changes that have been brought about by the project.
In the preparation phase, emphasis will be on capturing the current situation, i.e. the situation before any activities are put in place, the needs, objectives and purpose of the intervention, the target audience and its environment, what is being proposed and what outcomes are expected.
In reviewing project implementation, attention should be paid to content, delivery, quantity and cost, quality and use.
The assessment of changes brought about by the project should be examined on five levels : the individual, the community, the institution or organization, the nation and the global environment and the individuals and organizations doing the assessment. At each of these levels, the assessment process should take account of changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and actions, skills, and socio-economic environments.
RECOMMENDATIONS
FAO, CTA, and other organizations should develop and promote impact assessment for agricultural information programmes and projects. The aim of such initiatives should be to ensure that IA becomes an integral part of the planning and implementation cycle.
The following mechanisms should have priority.
* Sensitization of policy- and decision-makers.
* Development of a cadre of individuals trained in the processes and procedures of IA.
* Establishment of guidelines and standards for IA.
* Exchange of IA experiences between individuals and organizations.
